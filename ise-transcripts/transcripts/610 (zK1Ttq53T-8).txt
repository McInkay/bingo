I (0:01 - 0:03)
[Music] (0:05 - 0:16)
am what's up everyone welcome to the (0:13 - 0:19)
610th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:16 - 0:22)
it's super effective I'm your host Steve (0:19 - 0:24)
with me today is (0:22 - 0:27)
Hannah I am here I just got back biking (0:24 - 0:29)
for half an (0:27 - 0:32)
hour it's thankfully not raining outside (0:29 - 0:33)
I'm all (0:32 - 0:36)
good just a little (0:33 - 0:38)
tired I traveled all day I'm a little (0:36 - 0:41)
tired uh you're more (0:38 - 0:45)
tired Bobby is also here I'm actually (0:41 - 0:47)
not tired because I'm uh getting better (0:45 - 0:50)
sleep since I'm using Pokemon sleep now (0:47 - 0:52)
uh I don't think that's (0:50 - 0:55)
true I mean it's kind of true I'm at (0:52 - 0:58)
least tracking my sleep now maybe maybe (0:55 - 1:01)
it's not okay that much better but it's (0:58 - 1:02)
being (1:01 - 1:04)
tracked theoretically that improves (1:02 - 1:07)
things yeah According to some studies (1:04 - 1:09)
sure I have confirmation that I'm not (1:07 - 1:10)
doing well sleeping but you know at (1:09 - 1:13)
least now now I have confirmation that's (1:10 - 1:17)
not the same thing as it improving (1:13 - 1:21)
but um I just got back from uh PAX East (1:17 - 1:25)
and Pokemon was there uh so we'll talk (1:21 - 1:29)
about that uh we also have the April (1:25 - 1:31)
update for Pokémon (1:29 - 1:36)
go and we have an interview with (1:31 - 1:37)
somebody who used to work at Pokemon (1:36 - 1:40)
that talks about shutting down fan-made (1:37 - 1:43)
games which they came out like two weeks (1:40 - 1:45)
ago but we've been covering other stuff (1:43 - 1:48)
uh but before we get to any of that uh (1:45 - 1:50)
let's talk about Pokemon sleep since if (1:48 - 1:53)
you're listening to this it will finally (1:50 - 1:55)
be the raicho event which is the first (1:53 - 1:57)
legendary (1:55 - 2:01)
finally and um (1:57 - 2:03)
and it's it's more importantly it's been (2:01 - 2:05)
a full week since Bobby's been playing (2:03 - 2:07)
Pokemon sleep (2:05 - 2:10)
so how how is your first week (2:07 - 2:13)
experience you know um I'm not really (2:10 - 2:16)
sure what I'm doing in the game still (2:13 - 2:20)
the whole like I am sleeping I'm waking (2:16 - 2:24)
up collecting Pokemon uh which is what I (2:20 - 2:26)
was promised when uh this game was (2:24 - 2:29)
introduced so uh it's fulfilling that (2:26 - 2:30)
promise (2:29 - 2:35)
um but aside from that uh it's fun but (2:30 - 2:38)
again I haven't really like I haven't uh (2:35 - 2:41)
really dubed into like all of the I (2:38 - 2:43)
haven't opened up any websites to see (2:41 - 2:45)
any calculators or anything I haven't (2:43 - 2:47)
watched any of the YouTube videos no (2:45 - 2:49)
haven't haven't really like jumped in (2:47 - 2:53)
that deep uh but uh I am getting started (2:49 - 2:56)
with it so what does your team look (2:53 - 2:59)
like oh what does my team look like um (2:56 - 3:02)
you got that find and Caterpie I have a (2:59 - 3:03)
berry find and Caterpie but it's not (3:02 - 3:06)
level 10 yet uh (3:03 - 3:10)
so um but I have a Caterpie I have a (3:06 - 3:13)
Pikachu uh I I have a I have a (3:10 - 3:16)
Togepi I have a I mean I can open up the (3:13 - 3:20)
app and see um I'm Pikachu caterp toap I (3:16 - 3:22)
know those three (3:20 - 3:25)
um I just caught a real real Ash catch (3:22 - 3:27)
him in the (3:25 - 3:31)
making uh oh I have a Charmander (3:27 - 3:38)
Charmander uh and I have a Mankey so not (3:31 - 3:41)
reallyis yeah so right well so the first (3:38 - 3:44)
week it make it made me it like it (3:41 - 3:45)
wouldn't let me (3:44 - 3:48)
choose my location or island or whatever (3:45 - 3:51)
yeah you'll have to unlock sleep styles (3:48 - 3:54)
to get more locations Yeah the more (3:51 - 3:55)
Pokemon you find the more locations you (3:54 - 3:58)
can go to yeah so I haven't unlocked (3:55 - 4:02)
lapis yet uh yeah so I mean it's fun (3:58 - 4:03)
it's I haven't like I haven't bought (4:02 - 4:05)
anything yet (4:03 - 4:07)
shockingly no no (4:05 - 4:11)
premium so I haven't yet I was going to (4:07 - 4:13)
I I was going to start that like TR (4:11 - 4:15)
because you get like a twoe trial right (4:13 - 4:17)
so yeah I think starting it during (4:15 - 4:19)
raicho is (4:17 - 4:21)
probably the same that's kind of what I (4:19 - 4:23)
was thinking so I was actually going to (4:21 - 4:27)
start it today and then see how that (4:23 - 4:29)
improves my I I really need to like (4:27 - 4:31)
learn more about it though like I really (4:29 - 4:32)
have not like jumped into a whole bunch (4:31 - 4:35)
of stuff because um Steve I told you (4:32 - 4:37)
this the other at the same time I also (4:35 - 4:38)
downloaded Cafe remix and so I've been (4:37 - 4:41)
playing that as well um talking about (4:38 - 4:45)
games that take your money yeah I yeah (4:41 - 4:46)
yes absolutely I'm not spending any (4:45 - 4:48)
money on that it's like filled with just (4:46 - 4:51)
money money money but uh so I haven't (4:48 - 4:54)
really uh Gone deep into to Pokemon (4:51 - 4:56)
sleep yet but uh I'm getting there and (4:54 - 5:00)
it's it's fun it's it's it's another app (4:56 - 5:03)
to open in the morning other than (5:00 - 5:07)
Pokemon go so there is that to (5:03 - 5:11)
it um we didn't mention this last week I (5:07 - 5:13)
I did mention this in the slack I think (5:11 - 5:14)
this this is really well we're we're (5:13 - 5:16)
going to do some more raicho stuff for (5:14 - 5:18)
those that are still very confused on (5:16 - 5:20)
what's Happening we have more (5:18 - 5:26)
information now that it is Monday in not (5:20 - 5:30)
America so we we know how riko works I I (5:26 - 5:32)
think to the fullest at this point I (5:30 - 5:34)
think the only thing we don't know is if (5:32 - 5:35)
it's shiny locked or (5:34 - 5:38)
not um because we know that the first (5:35 - 5:40)
raicho you catch will be the same as (5:38 - 5:43)
everyone else's raicho so the skills and (5:40 - 5:45)
everything will be the same we just (5:43 - 5:46)
don't know (5:45 - 5:49)
if they locked the skills and locked the (5:46 - 5:52)
shiny but again there hasn't been a (5:49 - 5:55)
shiny lock in the game yet so but it (5:52 - 5:57)
could be just like the first one is (5:55 - 5:59)
locked and then everyone after that is (5:57 - 6:01)
unlocked but but I don't know again (5:59 - 6:04)
we'll probably find out by the time this (6:01 - 6:05)
podcast podcast goes up we'll probably (6:04 - 6:07)
find out because I'm sure a bunch of (6:05 - 6:10)
whales will have bought the incense and (6:07 - 6:12)
then used the incense to use the master (6:10 - 6:13)
ball and then one of them would probably (6:12 - 6:16)
see a shiny I would assume so I think (6:13 - 6:18)
like Pokemon go we will find out very (6:16 - 6:21)
quickly if something is locked or not (6:18 - 6:24)
speaking of master ball master ball (6:21 - 6:26)
biscuit or whatever they're called um (6:24 - 6:29)
you last week said that like I would (6:26 - 6:31)
have to kind of buy a master ball (6:29 - 6:34)
biscuit or whatever for the (6:31 - 6:37)
tutorial uh but it made me use (6:34 - 6:40)
it I couldn't get around using it I feel (6:37 - 6:43)
like before a certain update there was a (6:40 - 6:47)
way to like quit during using it I could (6:43 - 6:48)
have tried to close the app I guess and (6:47 - 6:50)
just seen if like the tutorial just kind (6:48 - 6:53)
of skipped past it but I had to use it (6:50 - 6:55)
so I'm pretty sure I used it on a (6:53 - 6:58)
Caterpie I was wondering if it was the (6:55 - 7:02)
Caterpie that was Berry finding s it was (6:58 - 7:04)
the Barry finding s Caterpie yes it was (7:02 - 7:06)
perfect that was that's worth the master (7:04 - 7:09)
ball um yeah so this is what we didn't (7:06 - 7:13)
say last week this was on we covered two (7:09 - 7:15)
different Pokemon sleep dot I think it's (7:13 - 7:18)
Pokemon (7:15 - 7:18)
sleep.now they actually had a third one (7:20 - 7:25)
which was like three weeks ago but (7:22 - 7:26)
anyways the most important part about (7:25 - 7:28)
that third one it says we are preparing (7:26 - 7:31)
functions that Rewards and rewards that (7:28 - 7:33)
allow Pokemon sleep beginners to (7:31 - 7:35)
research raicho sleeping Styles and (7:33 - 7:38)
befriend it so I think I think this is (7:35 - 7:41)
the thing I want to stress and why I why (7:38 - 7:43)
it's really funny that Bobby just (7:41 - 7:44)
started playing because I think it's (7:43 - 7:47)
very possible and very easy for Bobby (7:44 - 7:49)
and anyone else who is like just started (7:47 - 7:51)
playing or free to play to get this (7:49 - 7:54)
raicho I think that you don't need a (7:51 - 7:56)
master ball and I would actually maybe (7:54 - 7:58)
argue that using your master ball on (7:56 - 8:01)
raicho is probably waste unless you (7:58 - 8:05)
really want multiple reos for different (8:01 - 8:09)
skills but we now know that raicho the (8:05 - 8:11)
raicho the raicho biscuit gives six we (8:09 - 8:13)
know that last (8:11 - 8:15)
week and raicho needs 30 points to (8:13 - 8:19)
capture Which is higher than any other (8:15 - 8:21)
Pokemon I think Tyranitar and Dragonite (8:19 - 8:23)
is like 24 or 25 or something they're (8:21 - 8:25)
like the they were the highest up to (8:23 - 8:30)
this point um but if and we also know (8:25 - 8:32)
the store but ideally if we just do (8:30 - 8:36)
basic math 30 divided 6 is five so you (8:32 - 8:38)
have to see you have to have five raicho (8:36 - 8:41)
biscuits to get him and as far as I know (8:38 - 8:44)
no Pokemon gets hungry after one so if (8:41 - 8:46)
you give him one biscuit he's not going (8:44 - 8:49)
to so let's say he he always gets hungry (8:46 - 8:50)
after two which is my experience with (8:49 - 8:53)
Den which is incredibly frustrating you (8:50 - 8:55)
would only have to see raicho three (8:53 - 8:58)
times and have five biscuits to get him (8:55 - 9:00)
and they've made it really possible to (8:58 - 9:02)
see (9:00 - 9:05)
REO five times (9:02 - 9:10)
minimum with the the the the (9:05 - 9:11)
store (9:10 - 9:14)
um so we we know we know we know the (9:11 - 9:16)
store stuff now the event the event (9:14 - 9:18)
store they are calling it The Event (9:16 - 9:20)
exchange the thing that hasn't showed up (9:18 - 9:21)
for any of us yet oh where you can (9:20 - 9:25)
exchange the main for the biscuits or (9:21 - 9:27)
the incense where you can exchange the (9:25 - 9:29)
special currency that is being used only (9:27 - 9:31)
in this event for the items that are (9:29 - 9:35)
being used to catch Raichu right okay (9:31 - 9:37)
yeah yeah (9:35 - 9:42)
so when you sleep you will be getting (9:37 - 9:44)
raicho (9:42 - 9:46)
Main and also if you have friends on (9:44 - 9:48)
your friends list instead of getting (9:46 - 9:50)
candy this week it's possible to get (9:48 - 9:51)
raicho (9:50 - 9:54)
Maine um and you can only get Rao main (9:51 - 9:56)
one sleep session a day so napping will (9:54 - 9:59)
not help cuz it's your first sleep (9:56 - 10:00)
session of the day just keep that in (9:59 - 10:04)
mind but in the store you'll be able in (10:00 - 10:07)
the non-paid store in The Exchange store (10:04 - 10:08)
that Hannah (10:07 - 10:11)
said very (10:08 - 10:15)
easy uh the first two raicho incenses (10:11 - 10:19)
are 80 Mains and then the next three (10:15 - 10:22)
after that are 160 so without any (10:19 - 10:25)
spending any money at (10:22 - 10:28)
all um you can get raicho to show up (10:25 - 10:30)
five times (10:28 - 10:34)
guaranteed and that's not and even if (10:30 - 10:36)
you had the worst luck of like he's he's (10:34 - 10:39)
hungry after he FS up after two and he's (10:36 - 10:42)
not hungry so you don't get the Boost (10:39 - 10:43)
which if you got the Boost that's three (10:42 - 10:47)
that's what six time three that's (10:43 - 10:47)
18 like you would just have to be (10:47 - 10:53)
prepared to have a biscuit or two (10:49 - 10:56)
biscuits per raicho and even so like (10:53 - 10:58)
even if you didn't have the biscuits or (10:56 - 11:00)
you used two and he was still hungry you (10:58 - 11:01)
could still use your premium biscuit you (11:00 - 11:03)
could still use your daily biscuit you (11:01 - 11:06)
could still use your great (11:03 - 11:09)
ball like you it's two weeks long you (11:06 - 11:12)
should be really good to not use your (11:09 - 11:14)
master ball at all I would say if you (11:12 - 11:16)
are going to use your master (11:14 - 11:19)
ball I would probably use it as soon as (11:16 - 11:24)
possible so then when he does appear (11:19 - 11:27)
again if he's hungry or if you have (11:24 - 11:29)
biscuits then you're you can get a (11:27 - 11:31)
second one even quicker (11:29 - 11:34)
didn't okay didn't the event I could be (11:31 - 11:36)
completely wrong I thought it said only (11:34 - 11:39)
one would show up during the event (11:36 - 11:43)
though I feel like it (11:39 - 11:43)
did didn't it say like after the event (11:43 - 11:47)
it can show up more per person and then (11:46 - 11:49)
it would show up in the future after the (11:47 - 11:51)
event yeah but you can still force him (11:49 - 11:53)
to spawn with the incense and he will he (11:51 - 11:55)
will spawn for (11:53 - 11:58)
sure after master rank nine well not for (11:55 - 12:00)
sure you know in order to get him to (11:58 - 12:04)
spawn in the future mhm you have to be (12:00 - 12:06)
at least Master ranked nine oh God but (12:04 - 12:08)
that doesn't apply to the incense right (12:06 - 12:09)
not your so like if you can get to (12:08 - 12:11)
master rank (12:09 - 12:14)
nine in the week in this week or next oh (12:11 - 12:16)
well I guess in any future week There's (12:14 - 12:19)
a chance that he will appear master rank (12:16 - 12:23)
nine how do you get to master rank (12:19 - 12:23)
nine I think the highest I've gotten to (12:23 - 12:28)
is like 16 or 17 I guess I got to get (12:25 - 12:30)
good because I'm not not there or (12:28 - 12:33)
anywhere near (12:30 - 12:33)
it uh so yeah and then also in the store (12:33 - 12:39)
um biscuits are the first two biscuits (12:37 - 12:40)
are (12:39 - 12:42)
60 (12:40 - 12:44)
main yeah this is all assuming we are (12:42 - 12:48)
able to get enough of the (12:44 - 12:50)
Raichu I was going to say how much are (12:48 - 12:52)
you getting a night or like when you do (12:50 - 12:55)
get it what was the well you're getting (12:52 - 12:58)
it from when your Pokemon wake up in the (12:55 - 13:00)
morning after the sleep and then you're (12:58 - 13:03)
also getting it based on elect Pokemon (13:00 - 13:05)
spawning in (13:03 - 13:09)
your camp and then it looks like you're (13:05 - 13:13)
getting two-ish for your friends list so (13:09 - 13:16)
I I'm thinking like if you have 50 (13:13 - 13:18)
friends and you're getting two per (13:16 - 13:20)
friend because the one screenshot I saw (13:18 - 13:22)
like their whole friends list all of it (13:20 - 13:25)
had raicho main that's 100 a (13:22 - 13:27)
night okay oh assuming you have a full (13:25 - 13:29)
than I was expecting well I need more (13:27 - 13:31)
friends (13:29 - 13:33)
yeah I'm not it doesn't say your friends (13:31 - 13:35)
are guaranteed to give you raicho m but (13:33 - 13:36)
when you see a screenshot of seven (13:35 - 13:39)
friends and they're all raicho main like (13:36 - 13:40)
a like I can only see seven in the (13:39 - 13:42)
screenshot and they're all raicho main (13:40 - 13:45)
so assume assuming they had 50 friends (13:42 - 13:47)
that's pretty good that seven in a row (13:45 - 13:51)
got main I don't know what the other 43 (13:47 - 13:53)
got (13:51 - 13:58)
yeah so again I think I think I'm just (13:53 - 14:00)
stressing (13:58 - 14:04)
30 to fill them six per main 6 Time 5 is (14:00 - 14:06)
30 you can give him two normally when he (14:04 - 14:09)
appears should be plenty should be (14:06 - 14:10)
plenty and again the store lasts for two (14:09 - 14:13)
weeks so it's not like you have to buy (14:10 - 14:15)
all of this stuff this first week and if (14:13 - 14:18)
you miss them it's (14:15 - 14:21)
gone now but I think if you are limited (14:18 - 14:24)
on points and you only have one Master (14:21 - 14:26)
Ball I think I'm really stressing I (14:24 - 14:27)
don't know if it's worth using your (14:26 - 14:29)
master ball because if they're going (14:27 - 14:32)
introduce Lugia or hoo or ente or suun (14:29 - 14:34)
we don't know if those Pokemon will also (14:32 - 14:37)
have a two we event maybe some of them (14:34 - 14:38)
will but I can't imagine they're going (14:37 - 14:40)
to be like here's a two-e event for (14:38 - 14:42)
every single (14:40 - 14:45)
legendary they could they absolutely (14:42 - 14:47)
could yeah they I guess they could if (14:45 - 14:50)
they make some (14:47 - 14:50)
money but I also think it's smart that (14:51 - 14:55)
they (14:54 - 14:58)
um they like position I think this has (14:55 - 15:00)
to be on purpose so they they did the (14:58 - 15:02)
like electric week and then there's a (15:00 - 15:03)
week of nothing in between which we just (15:02 - 15:06)
finished which I think was smart because (15:03 - 15:07)
when you go into the two weeks of rco (15:06 - 15:09)
you actually get an opportunity to buy (15:07 - 15:11)
two master ball biscuit biscuits you get (15:09 - 15:14)
the one for this month and then the the (15:11 - 15:16)
the the event re the month resets and (15:14 - 15:18)
then you have so if you already wasted (15:16 - 15:20)
your master ball biscuit this (15:18 - 15:23)
month my is (15:20 - 15:26)
fantastic I have gotten so many Critical (15:23 - 15:28)
Hits on my meals thanks to my D and I (15:26 - 15:30)
have a Caterpie (15:28 - 15:32)
so that's true if you either got a (15:30 - 15:35)
Caterpie or a den this month you would (15:32 - 15:37)
technically be able to buy master (15:35 - 15:40)
ball in what six days (15:37 - 15:45)
MH but again I I don't like I just feel (15:40 - 15:46)
like if you used your master ball these (15:45 - 15:50)
two weeks and then raicho just appears (15:46 - 15:51)
in six months in the future and you (15:50 - 15:52)
don't have a master ball there's just (15:51 - 15:55)
like no way you're going to get it right (15:52 - 15:56)
because it's already you already have to (15:55 - 15:59)
get to master rank nine mhm and it's (15:56 - 16:01)
what like such a like I just think of (15:59 - 16:04)
like trying to get Absol or Deni to (16:01 - 16:07)
appear which I had a K in my in my game (16:04 - 16:09)
for the second time this morning I (16:07 - 16:11)
finally got it more than halfway this (16:09 - 16:13)
game's been out for what seven months (16:11 - 16:17)
eight months yeah I have yet to see a (16:13 - 16:19)
Charizard which I think is what master (16:17 - 16:21)
rank 12 he starts (16:19 - 16:24)
appearing um I think I've seen a (16:21 - 16:27)
Venusaur before uh (16:24 - 16:31)
but yeah I think think I think if you're (16:27 - 16:33)
free to play (16:31 - 16:36)
maybe I think you should be fine they it (16:33 - 16:38)
does seem very based off the screenshots (16:36 - 16:39)
and everything it does seem very (16:38 - 16:40)
obtainable that everyone should be able (16:39 - 16:44)
to get a raicho if they're just playing (16:40 - 16:46)
every day for (16:44 - 16:48)
free you could just buy Maine in the (16:46 - 16:50)
store by the way they are selling raicho (16:48 - 16:53)
Maine for real money in the store yeah (16:50 - 16:56)
they are the largest of the boxes is (16:53 - 17:00)
3,000 diamonds which is about (16:56 - 17:03)
$50 how much M you getting for that wow (17:00 - 17:06)
250 right you're (17:03 - 17:06)
getting (17:06 - 17:12)
200 Raichu M for that okay but you're (17:09 - 17:15)
also getting uh bunch of Raichu candy (17:12 - 17:16)
with (17:15 - 17:20)
it yeah you can use your main to just (17:16 - 17:22)
get candy in the store you can also get (17:20 - 17:25)
a main skill seed I didn't know this for (17:22 - 17:27)
the FY the first three four weeks of the (17:25 - 17:30)
game main skill seeds are super (17:27 - 17:33)
good uh so if if if you caught your (17:30 - 17:35)
raicho and you're debating on what to (17:33 - 17:38)
use your main (17:35 - 17:42)
on I think main skill seed for sure yep (17:38 - 17:43)
especially if you're a free-to-play (17:42 - 17:44)
player you don't have very many (17:43 - 17:47)
opportunities to get the skill seeds (17:44 - 17:49)
yeah skip Thunderstone skip dream (17:47 - 17:52)
clusters skip the candy well get the C (17:49 - 17:54)
get the raicho candy eventually but like (17:52 - 17:57)
once you catch raicho probably 100% (17:54 - 17:59)
prioritize that main skill seed because (17:57 - 18:01)
you only get one of them and it's (17:59 - 18:05)
350 main but again you have two weeks (18:01 - 18:09)
you also get main from doing missions so (18:05 - 18:11)
getting sarx to basic 2 is going to get (18:09 - 18:16)
you 15 Ultra 1 25 Ultra 4 40 give out 15 (18:11 - 18:19)
biscuits 40 use seven incense 40 stick (18:16 - 18:23)
to your bedtime Bobby that'll get you 40 (18:19 - 18:25)
that's the tough one for me that that's (18:23 - 18:26)
the one I never get that's the one I (18:25 - 18:28)
never get so and I have the (18:26 - 18:31)
notifications on so like you know like (18:28 - 18:33)
the other day my wife was sitting next (18:31 - 18:34)
to me and my phone you know and it went (18:33 - 18:36)
off like the thing went off and it was (18:34 - 18:37)
like you know Pikachu's ready for bed (18:36 - 18:39)
are you and she was like what is that I (18:37 - 18:41)
was like it's just trying to get me to (18:39 - 18:47)
go to sleep doesn't work ever (18:41 - 18:47)
but it seems like a great event though (18:47 - 18:53)
and I like (18:50 - 18:56)
the I I I do like how it they've made it (18:53 - 18:58)
free to playay friendly but they've also (18:56 - 19:00)
I feel like they've also made it whale (18:58 - 19:01)
friendly they're like here's how you can (19:00 - 19:04)
give us money here's how you can get (19:01 - 19:06)
more than one (19:04 - 19:06)
raicho if only nant could learn from the (19:07 - 19:12)
freeto playay (19:10 - 19:15)
friendly again Pokemon sleep is still in (19:12 - 19:17)
early game they can and probably will (19:15 - 19:18)
get worse over (19:17 - 19:25)
[Laughter] (19:18 - 19:25)
time uh speaking of what's gotten worse (19:25 - 19:31)
over time time I think Pax has gotten (19:28 - 19:33)
worse over time oh (19:31 - 19:37)
no really it looks like a lot of fun (19:33 - 19:39)
yeah yeah (19:37 - 19:42)
um full disclosure I know I always say (19:39 - 19:45)
like this company paid for me but I (19:42 - 19:49)
legally have to say it like it in the US (19:45 - 19:51)
you have to disclose when a company (19:49 - 19:54)
gives you something of monetary value (19:51 - 19:57)
even if it's like $10 so full disclosure (19:54 - 20:01)
packs paid for my 4day pass two packs (19:57 - 20:03)
which I think is like $250 I bought my (20:01 - 20:06)
own flight bought my own hotel that kind (20:03 - 20:08)
of stuff so there's just your disclosure (20:06 - 20:14)
legally I have to say that um I've been (20:08 - 20:14)
to probably 10 packes between packs East (20:14 - 20:21)
packs West packs South which no longer (20:18 - 20:25)
exist and I do think a part same same (20:21 - 20:28)
with Pokémon go I think a lot of the (20:25 - 20:30)
events even though pack inside does rely (20:28 - 20:33)
on like the weather of a city and how (20:30 - 20:36)
like nice it is like spending was my (20:33 - 20:39)
flight like $350 to get to Boston and it (20:36 - 20:42)
just pouring slash being incredibly cold (20:39 - 20:46)
and bitter all weekend does not invite (20:42 - 20:51)
you to want to explore that City in any (20:46 - 20:51)
means nope which being in a big huge (20:52 - 20:57)
Convention Center didn't help though I'm (20:55 - 21:00)
assuming it was in one yeah the the the (20:57 - 21:01)
thing with (21:00 - 21:04)
um the thing that I love about Boston is (21:01 - 21:06)
the public transportation is so good so (21:04 - 21:09)
when you take like orange line down to (21:06 - 21:11)
um South Station and then you transfer (21:09 - 21:14)
to Silver Line you're that's still like (21:11 - 21:15)
a 10-minute walk from the end of silver (21:14 - 21:18)
line two packs which is all (21:15 - 21:21)
outside and like you could Uber I guess (21:18 - 21:23)
like I did Uber when it was pouring on (21:21 - 21:27)
the last day I Uber I went in the rain (21:23 - 21:30)
yeah I went like South station I went (21:27 - 21:31)
from orange line to South Station and (21:30 - 21:32)
then I ubered from South Station to the (21:31 - 21:34)
convention so I just didn't walk that (21:32 - 21:36)
last 10 minutes and it was still like a (21:34 - 21:38)
$15 Uber to like (21:36 - 21:40)
literally get that (21:38 - 21:43)
far um and I can't imagine doing that (21:40 - 21:45)
every I'm look I know there are people (21:43 - 21:46)
that are like I'm ubering Every Day I'm (21:45 - 21:48)
not taking public transit but like that (21:46 - 21:51)
is such an appeal to Boston for me is (21:48 - 21:54)
like the fact that you don't need a car (21:51 - 21:57)
and that you can get so many places on (21:54 - 21:58)
public (21:57 - 22:00)
transit it was just like a really cold (21:58 - 22:03)
weekend the biggest vendors at packs (22:00 - 22:06)
were Final Fantasy 14 they're always (22:03 - 22:08)
there and then Boulders Gate 3 had a (22:06 - 22:10)
huge Booth they that like one game of (22:08 - 22:12)
the year so that makes sense they were (22:10 - 22:16)
there um the Diablo game that's not (22:12 - 22:18)
Diablo I can't remember what it Path of (22:16 - 22:22)
Exile had a really big booth and then (22:18 - 22:24)
Nintendo pookemon had technically like (22:22 - 22:27)
three booths which was announced for the (22:24 - 22:30)
record this is like not Pokemon does is (22:27 - 22:32)
it's not a surprise Pokemon or Nintendo (22:30 - 22:34)
was there Nintendo actually goes to (22:32 - 22:36)
quite a bit of packes the packs right (22:34 - 22:40)
before Co Nintendo had like the world's (22:36 - 22:42)
coolest animal crossing booth that you (22:40 - 22:45)
could visit and it had the longest line (22:42 - 22:48)
for the merch they had like a separate (22:45 - 22:50)
booth that was just like animal crossing (22:48 - 22:51)
merch that was well that was right (22:50 - 22:53)
before the game came out yeah it was (22:51 - 22:55)
before the game came out and the line (22:53 - 22:59)
for the merch was insanely long and you (22:55 - 23:00)
would have to get there at 8:00 a.m. (22:59 - 23:02)
stand in line for like 4 hours and hope (23:00 - 23:04)
they have the t-shirt in near size cuz (23:02 - 23:06)
they would run out every day and then (23:04 - 23:10)
restock sizes and stuff so this year (23:06 - 23:13)
they had the play lab which they've been (23:10 - 23:14)
doing at pretty much every packs they (23:13 - 23:18)
also did it at Pokemon go Seattle uh go (23:14 - 23:20)
Fest Seattle they had the play lab there (23:18 - 23:23)
too I don't did they have playlab in New (23:20 - 23:26)
York probably not because it was outside (23:23 - 23:29)
yeah no I'm pretty sure had like a (23:26 - 23:32)
convention Hub Hall that they put it in (23:29 - 23:34)
oh that's cool I didn't realize that but (23:32 - 23:37)
what the play lab is is you wait in line (23:34 - 23:40)
to learn how to play the TCG they give (23:37 - 23:42)
you like a 30 card deck like a smaller (23:40 - 23:44)
deck and it was funny cuz the guy was (23:42 - 23:46)
like we de we definitely like rig the (23:44 - 23:48)
deck so like your opening hand is not (23:46 - 23:50)
terrible but like everything after that (23:48 - 23:52)
is randomized which is like really smart (23:50 - 23:54)
for like teaching to be like okay I'm (23:52 - 23:56)
guaranteed at least one supporter two (23:54 - 23:59)
item cards energy three Pokemon that (23:56 - 24:03)
kind of stuff um but you wait in line to (23:59 - 24:08)
get a pin and at P's unplugged which is (24:03 - 24:09)
the board gaming one they were giving (24:08 - 24:12)
away a quackley pin and then at Seattle (24:09 - 24:14)
the one I went to they gave away a f (24:12 - 24:16)
Coco and I think East last year which I (24:14 - 24:18)
missed was (24:16 - 24:21)
spatio uh and I was like okay they did (24:18 - 24:23)
all three starters maybe they're (24:21 - 24:26)
recycling nope they got more this time (24:23 - 24:29)
it was taguri the curly form which was (24:26 - 24:32)
really cool so the cool thing about PA (24:29 - 24:34)
pins is they just ripped off Disney all (24:32 - 24:39)
it is is is like Disney like get a pin (24:34 - 24:41)
and then trade or sell like I there was (24:39 - 24:45)
a cyberpunk panel that (24:41 - 24:47)
ended and people were pouring out of the (24:45 - 24:49)
cyberpunk panel if you went you got a (24:47 - 24:52)
free pin but people were waiting at the (24:49 - 24:54)
exit of the cyberpunk panel being like (24:52 - 24:56)
anyone selling pins selling pins give (24:54 - 24:58)
you 20 bucks for your PIN cuz they were (24:56 - 25:00)
like planning to to flip it because (24:58 - 25:01)
they're worth money the Pokemon ones are (25:00 - 25:04)
worth money too usually these pins are (25:01 - 25:05)
like5 to (25:04 - 25:08)
$20 normally at like a booth like oh I'm (25:05 - 25:10)
going to go to like the Night in the (25:08 - 25:11)
Woods booth and get the Night in the (25:10 - 25:13)
Woods pack pin it's like 15 bucks but (25:11 - 25:15)
the Pokemon ones are free always have (25:13 - 25:18)
been free you can't buy them you do have (25:15 - 25:20)
to sit through the entire demo of them (25:18 - 25:23)
teaching you how to play (25:20 - 25:26)
um and it's a good experience they give (25:23 - 25:27)
you like free stickers they give you (25:26 - 25:29)
like a little book when you're done you (25:27 - 25:32)
get the pin you get a free 30 card deck (25:29 - 25:34)
like they give you a lot of stuff just (25:32 - 25:37)
for waiting in line and playing the TCG (25:34 - 25:39)
you also learn the TCG which I would say (25:37 - 25:41)
is is an experience in itself to people (25:39 - 25:44)
who don't know the TCG oh it's really (25:41 - 25:46)
smart (25:44 - 25:50)
like the the the the miss here to any (25:46 - 25:53)
Nintendo or Pokemon rep listening to (25:50 - 25:55)
this podcast (25:53 - 25:59)
is there's no Pokemon Center at Pax (25:55 - 26:03)
which is mindblowing to me that yeah (25:59 - 26:06)
especially when Pax has more show floor (26:03 - 26:07)
ever since (26:06 - 26:09)
Co um where it's like they could (26:07 - 26:11)
definitely look also Nintendo could just (26:09 - 26:13)
get any part of the show floor they want (26:11 - 26:15)
that's not a (26:13 - 26:18)
problem but you the the play lab is (26:15 - 26:20)
pretty big to like sit down and play and (26:18 - 26:23)
then you walk across to another booth (26:20 - 26:25)
area which had photo opportunities with (26:23 - 26:29)
like a blowups quackle f f Coco spur (26:25 - 26:32)
and then there's just like a what could (26:29 - 26:35)
be a merch store but it's just like two (26:32 - 26:37)
people sitting there being like okay you (26:35 - 26:39)
played here's your pen what deck would (26:37 - 26:42)
you like for free and it just feels like (26:39 - 26:46)
a big Miss for a (26:42 - 26:50)
convention a gaming convention with (26:46 - 26:51)
opportunity for people to spend money I (26:50 - 26:53)
mean like merch is just a big part of (26:51 - 26:55)
gaming conventions and I say like oh (26:53 - 26:56)
well maybe they've never done that (26:55 - 26:59)
before they have at Gen Con (26:56 - 27:01)
they the very first year they appeared (26:59 - 27:04)
at Gen Con which was before covid trying (27:01 - 27:08)
to remember 2018 I think maybe 2017 they (27:04 - 27:09)
just had a Pokemon Center it was no (27:08 - 27:12)
playlab it was just a physical store W (27:09 - 27:15)
and they were just selling things and I (27:12 - 27:16)
don't know if they do that anymore I (27:15 - 27:18)
know for sure play playlab does go to (27:16 - 27:24)
Gen Con but it it feels like a Miss for (27:18 - 27:26)
them because there's so many like (27:24 - 27:29)
smaller booths like fan gamer or (27:26 - 27:31)
whatever that just sell Pokemon merch (27:29 - 27:32)
yeah that's where you get Pokemon merch (27:31 - 27:35)
at any convention all the small fan (27:32 - 27:36)
stuff well I was going to say are they (27:35 - 27:40)
do does Nintendo sell any merch at packs (27:36 - 27:41)
at all they they sold the Animal (27:40 - 27:44)
Crossing stuff four years five years ago (27:41 - 27:47)
whatever right but say they haven't (27:44 - 27:48)
Nintendo's not selling anything since (27:47 - 27:52)
then when no well before Animal Crossing (27:48 - 27:54)
it was what Mario Odyssey and they were (27:52 - 27:57)
selling Odyssey merch and then before (27:54 - 28:00)
Odyssey was Zelda tears of the king not (27:57 - 28:03)
tears breath of the Wild what Zelda game (28:00 - 28:04)
was that and they were selling breath of (28:03 - 28:07)
the wild stuff um so maybe it's a (28:04 - 28:11)
Pokemon decision a Pokemon decision (28:07 - 28:13)
then I mean it seems like they're (28:11 - 28:15)
selling stuff when there's a lot of hype (28:13 - 28:17)
around a game and Pokemon is kind of (28:15 - 28:21)
ongoing hype and they don't have don't (28:17 - 28:22)
have a new main Series game coming out (28:21 - 28:25)
this year as far as we know there's a (28:22 - 28:27)
lot of cost that goes into getting the (28:25 - 28:29)
stuff there and so so maybe it's just (28:27 - 28:30)
not worth (28:29 - 28:33)
it yeah I don't know I feel (28:30 - 28:35)
like if they brought stuff they would (28:33 - 28:37)
not have to bring anything back I feel (28:35 - 28:38)
like they would definitely sell through (28:37 - 28:41)
it yeah I feel like they would do a good (28:38 - 28:43)
job at selling regardless but maybe not (28:41 - 28:44)
I think what like if you're getting if (28:43 - 28:46)
you're getting a free 30 card deck and a (28:44 - 28:49)
free pen it's almost a good opportunity (28:46 - 28:53)
to be like here we we we have (28:49 - 28:57)
etbs like oh you enjoyed playing the TCG (28:53 - 29:00)
you now know how to play at a very basic (28:57 - 29:03)
level look at this $50 ETB behind us (29:00 - 29:05)
that you could purchase on your way out (29:03 - 29:07)
brand new I mean specifically for this (29:05 - 29:10)
weekend it brand new set came out on (29:07 - 29:15)
Friday so it's there is that I guess but (29:10 - 29:17)
yeah I just I just feel like that's like (29:15 - 29:20)
a slightly missed opportunity to be like (29:17 - 29:22)
oh Pokemon has such a huge presence here (29:20 - 29:23)
because they were one of the bigger (29:22 - 29:25)
booths not that they had a lot to (29:23 - 29:26)
compete with (29:25 - 29:29)
I but (29:26 - 29:31)
you could walk away with like a Pikachu (29:29 - 29:34)
plush so the third Booth because they (29:31 - 29:38)
had three was not near the play lab or (29:34 - 29:40)
the like redeem area it was on the other (29:38 - 29:44)
side of packs and it was a demo station (29:40 - 29:47)
with like six to eight Nintendo switches (29:44 - 29:49)
set up in like you know what you walk (29:47 - 29:51)
into like GameStop and they have like (29:49 - 29:54)
the demo station or whatever Target and (29:51 - 29:56)
you could pick between Legends (29:54 - 29:59)
archus scarlet and violet or detective (29:56 - 30:01)
Pikachu and they had ready to go demos (29:59 - 30:03)
for all three of those (30:01 - 30:07)
games and you would think after two plus (30:03 - 30:08)
years of Legends being (30:07 - 30:11)
out that was like the most played game I (30:08 - 30:13)
saw on all of those screens where people (30:11 - 30:17)
like oh I want to demo Legends MH so I (30:13 - 30:19)
think it just it makes me think like (30:17 - 30:20)
sometimes we feel like we're in our (30:19 - 30:22)
bubble of like oh everyone has played (30:20 - 30:25)
Legends at this point but where else do (30:22 - 30:27)
you really have an like an opportunity (30:25 - 30:29)
to play that (30:27 - 30:30)
if you've never if you don't have a (30:29 - 30:33)
friend or if you didn't drop 60 bucks (30:30 - 30:35)
it's also the most I would say it's I (30:33 - 30:37)
mean it's the hyped game right now just (30:35 - 30:41)
because there's a Legends game coming so (30:37 - 30:43)
I could see people thinking oh there's (30:41 - 30:45)
the next game is a Legends game or the (30:43 - 30:47)
next game they announced is a Legends (30:45 - 30:49)
game and now I can play a different (30:47 - 30:51)
Legends game so I'll you know give that (30:49 - 30:53)
a try or or something like that you know (30:51 - 30:56)
so I I could see that being popular just (30:53 - 30:59)
for that reason it's also a great game (30:56 - 31:01)
so there's (30:59 - 31:01)
that and then on the other side of (31:02 - 31:09)
the demo station that they had set up (31:06 - 31:11)
they had this hand painted mural I don't (31:09 - 31:12)
know if you guys saw pictures of that on (31:11 - 31:16)
Twitter it looked so good it was it was (31:12 - 31:17)
so cool in person they finished it on (31:16 - 31:19)
Thursday morning before the con opened (31:17 - 31:21)
so I think if you were like Media or you (31:19 - 31:23)
were the very first people that got in (31:21 - 31:25)
you could see them finishing it up I (31:23 - 31:27)
think they originally started it at New (31:25 - 31:30)
York Comic-Con Maybe (31:27 - 31:30)
um and it wasn't completely done and (31:30 - 31:34)
then they brought it here and then the (31:32 - 31:37)
the artist was finishing it um I slept (31:34 - 31:41)
through that by the I didn't get in I I (31:37 - 31:42)
got in really late on Wednesday and I (31:41 - 31:45)
was like ah I don't know if I can get (31:42 - 31:47)
there at 9:00 a.m. to see them finish it (31:45 - 31:49)
uh but it was finished and then they (31:47 - 31:51)
allowed people to draw Pokemon on the (31:49 - 31:53)
left or right side in chalk and then (31:51 - 31:55)
every hour they would like wipe down the (31:53 - 31:57)
chalk and then more people would come in (31:55 - 31:59)
and then on the other side of that was a (31:57 - 32:01)
photo opportunity with either Pikachu or (31:59 - 32:03)
Eevee and obviously they cycled every (32:01 - 32:05)
like 20 (32:03 - 32:05)
minutes so dominant there Pokemon and (32:05 - 32:12)
Nintendo but like no way to give them (32:09 - 32:16)
money in any capacity which I just think (32:12 - 32:18)
is very (32:16 - 32:18)
weird I mean you can you can pick up (32:18 - 32:22)
your phone and give them money at any (32:21 - 32:25)
point in time true yeah I was going to (32:22 - 32:27)
say anyone who walked away from that TCG (32:25 - 32:30)
experience and and enjoyed it is going (32:27 - 32:32)
to give Pokemon a lot of money in the (32:30 - 32:35)
coming days and months probably yeah the (32:32 - 32:37)
other thing about the play lab is they (32:35 - 32:39)
started doing VGC stuff this is the (32:37 - 32:43)
first time ever so I I was waiting in (32:39 - 32:47)
the the TCG or yeah the TCG line because (32:43 - 32:49)
I was like I was like I don't need to do (32:47 - 32:52)
VGC stuff I just want the pen you got a (32:49 - 32:54)
different like you got like stickers or (32:52 - 32:56)
something for doing VGC but I'm waiting (32:54 - 32:59)
in line what was that you didn't get a (32:56 - 33:01)
pin for doing the VGC no you got a (32:59 - 33:02)
different (33:01 - 33:05)
prize which I think you should like in (33:02 - 33:07)
they should give you the pin they should (33:05 - 33:09)
yeah that's what everybody wants right I (33:07 - 33:11)
mean that was we just talked about the (33:09 - 33:13)
PIN for like 10 minutes so uh the (33:11 - 33:15)
sticker yeah the pin is great the the (33:13 - 33:18)
stickers are like a vinyl like not (33:15 - 33:20)
permanent sticker so if you put it on (33:18 - 33:21)
something you could technically peel it (33:20 - 33:24)
off sure they're like popular right now (33:21 - 33:26)
yeah they're they're fancier stickers of (33:24 - 33:29)
like kidon midon Le all that (33:26 - 33:32)
stuff so I'm I'm just about to like get (33:29 - 33:35)
sat down to play and then the the (33:32 - 33:37)
Nintendo rep (33:35 - 33:40)
who was the one that uh walked me (33:37 - 33:43)
through the scarlet and violet DLC demo (33:40 - 33:47)
was there nice and she stopped me and (33:43 - 33:49)
she was like did you do the VGC stuff (33:47 - 33:53)
and I was like no I'm I'm I I want the (33:49 - 33:57)
pin see and and she said well this is (33:53 - 33:59)
the first time we're doing VG stuff I (33:57 - 34:01)
built all the demo teams I would like (33:59 - 34:03)
you to do it because I want feedback on (34:01 - 34:06)
how these demo teams are that's cool and (34:03 - 34:08)
so I did the TCG stuff and then she (34:06 - 34:10)
pulled me after that and then she put me (34:08 - 34:12)
into the VGC thing which I wasn't going (34:10 - 34:15)
to do originally um and they had like (34:12 - 34:16)
three rental teams one was like a dond (34:15 - 34:18)
dozo team one was a team with ogre Pon (34:16 - 34:23)
One was a another team they were and and (34:18 - 34:24)
the the thing I noticed because it was (34:23 - 34:25)
like double battles and they were (34:24 - 34:27)
teaching people how to play VGC and the (34:25 - 34:30)
thing I noticed was only one Pokemon on (34:27 - 34:32)
each team of six only had protect and I (34:30 - 34:34)
was like wow this is really weird like (34:32 - 34:36)
I'm so used to like five out of six (34:34 - 34:38)
Pokemon having protect and the one that (34:36 - 34:39)
doesn't have protect is like probably (34:38 - 34:41)
assault vested or something right or (34:39 - 34:43)
like Choice (34:41 - 34:46)
banded and I gave her that feedback I (34:43 - 34:48)
was like I'm so used to like protecting (34:46 - 34:51)
and like setting up and then being able (34:48 - 34:52)
to like play around (34:51 - 34:54)
that and I was like I guess that's my (34:52 - 34:56)
feedback like I thought these teams were (34:54 - 34:59)
really neat like ogrean ogre Pon she's a (34:56 - 35:01)
queen she's like super strong really (34:59 - 35:03)
hard to like like why would you not pick (35:01 - 35:07)
the ogre Pon team like she's so good um (35:03 - 35:09)
but then I was thinking (35:07 - 35:13)
like you know how like the (35:09 - 35:15)
TCG like walks you through it whether (35:13 - 35:19)
you're playing TCG live or ptcgo or (35:15 - 35:21)
whatever and they like kind of like fake (35:19 - 35:23)
the first couple turns because they need (35:21 - 35:25)
to to like teach you how to play to be (35:23 - 35:28)
like oh you drew an energy place it here (35:25 - 35:30)
like play the supporter there's like no (35:28 - 35:33)
way to fake that in (35:30 - 35:35)
VGC and even though I'm like oh I think (35:33 - 35:37)
these teams need more protect as I'm (35:35 - 35:39)
like in the shower after packs like (35:37 - 35:43)
thinking about this I'm like a person (35:39 - 35:45)
who's never played VGC or somebody who's (35:43 - 35:47)
just gone through the story they've (35:45 - 35:50)
probably like never hit protect like why (35:47 - 35:53)
would you yep that's true and so if (35:50 - 35:55)
you're if you're playing VGC for the (35:53 - 35:56)
first (35:55 - 35:58)
time and (35:56 - 36:00)
you're and the the people teaching you (35:58 - 36:03)
are like well you might want to hit (36:00 - 36:04)
protect here why would I want to hit (36:03 - 36:06)
protect because they might double into (36:04 - 36:07)
your Pokemon but why would they do that (36:06 - 36:10)
it's like so complicated to be like why (36:07 - 36:13)
is this move here and why why would I (36:10 - 36:14)
use (36:13 - 36:16)
it that's the strategy though that's (36:14 - 36:17)
that's what you're supposed to be (36:16 - 36:19)
learning that's how that's the learning (36:17 - 36:21)
right because if you if you go into a (36:19 - 36:24)
demo and you play it a certain way and (36:21 - 36:27)
then you go into the real world of the (36:24 - 36:29)
VGC it's going to be very different (36:27 - 36:31)
right than what that demo is whereas (36:29 - 36:33)
they could make the demo set up to be (36:31 - 36:37)
more like what you're going to see when (36:33 - 36:39)
you're actually in there playing the VGC (36:37 - 36:41)
I don't play the VGC at all so but I'm (36:39 - 36:43)
just going off of what you just said and (36:41 - 36:45)
that you're like constantly seeing this (36:43 - 36:47)
or you're constantly seeing that so I (36:45 - 36:50)
mean I think that would make sense to (36:47 - 36:52)
set it up in a way like that since (36:50 - 36:55)
that's kind of what it is going into it (36:52 - 36:57)
in the real world yeah I think they (36:55 - 36:59)
should probably make an active attempt (36:57 - 37:02)
to make sure you are learning defensive (36:59 - 37:04)
moves make sure you are learning setup (37:02 - 37:08)
moves I am only just starting to get (37:04 - 37:09)
into some of this a little bit more (37:08 - 37:11)
right now but I'm definitely one of (37:09 - 37:13)
those people who will go through an (37:11 - 37:15)
entire playthrough and just attack (37:13 - 37:17)
attack attack attack attack never use (37:15 - 37:20)
protect never really use status moves (37:17 - 37:25)
never uh raise or lower any stats of (37:20 - 37:28)
mine or my opponents in my own play (37:25 - 37:30)
through um and that's really what they (37:28 - 37:32)
should be teaching (37:30 - 37:34)
people yeah this is like again their (37:32 - 37:36)
first time doing (37:34 - 37:38)
it and some employees were like yeah (37:36 - 37:40)
they didn't have enough switches so that (37:38 - 37:43)
this is my switch so ignore my like side (37:40 - 37:44)
teams (37:43 - 37:48)
here um wait hold on Nintendo yeah (37:44 - 37:50)
Pokemon company these Juggernaut (37:48 - 37:53)
companies didn't have enough (37:50 - 37:58)
switches yeah it seemed like a very last (37:53 - 38:00)
minute addition to the play lab okay (37:58 - 38:02)
because again this is the first time (38:00 - 38:03)
they did it and the first day on (38:02 - 38:06)
Thursday they had one line to get into (38:03 - 38:08)
the playlab and then the second day and (38:06 - 38:10)
for the rest of the con they broke it (38:08 - 38:14)
into two lines VGC line and TCG line um (38:10 - 38:17)
which was smarter which was much better (38:14 - 38:19)
yeah you could probably get to the VGC a (38:17 - 38:21)
whole lot faster that way yeah but it (38:19 - 38:24)
was it was exciting that they were (38:21 - 38:27)
starting that because I think that's (38:24 - 38:29)
cool there 's nothing in the game to (38:27 - 38:31)
like there's a lot that's not in (38:29 - 38:33)
skarland Violet there's nothing in the (38:31 - 38:37)
game to like set up a certain (38:33 - 38:40)
scenario like the TCG like they they can (38:37 - 38:42)
stack the deck in the TCG they can be (38:40 - 38:45)
like I can guarantee your seven card (38:42 - 38:47)
hand and the first three cards you're (38:45 - 38:49)
about to draw like they can stack it in (38:47 - 38:53)
a way where cuz because I played TCG for (38:49 - 38:56)
a long time and even if (38:53 - 38:58)
you're (38:56 - 39:00)
e even if you're like doing something (38:58 - 39:02)
like a 30 card deck very friendly small (39:00 - 39:03)
thing you could be like oh I Dre an (39:02 - 39:07)
energy okay pass next turn oh drw energy (39:03 - 39:09)
okay pass okay next turn because that (39:07 - 39:12)
happens it's just like how it shuffles (39:09 - 39:14)
but they can like at least set it up so (39:12 - 39:16)
that that doesn't happen and there's (39:14 - 39:20)
like no setup in VGC to be like okay I (39:16 - 39:23)
want you to double attack the ogre Pond (39:20 - 39:26)
ogre Pond person I want you to protect (39:23 - 39:29)
and like they tell you which Pokemon (39:26 - 39:31)
they could already have the team set up (39:29 - 39:33)
and already have the Pokemon chosen that (39:31 - 39:37)
are going to be sent out what on in the (39:33 - 39:40)
VGC was it people learning on both sides (39:37 - 39:42)
playing against each other okay that's (39:40 - 39:43)
what I was going to say it wasn't (39:42 - 39:46)
against a computer it was actually (39:43 - 39:49)
people against people if if you were (39:46 - 39:51)
with a friend well it it depended right (39:49 - 39:53)
you could you could you could also bring (39:51 - 39:54)
your own (39:53 - 39:56)
team they did say like oh if you have (39:54 - 39:58)
your switch and you want to use your (39:56 - 40:01)
team you can bring it so you could wait (39:58 - 40:03)
in line Like Me and Bobby could wait in (40:01 - 40:05)
line we could use our own teams and then (40:03 - 40:07)
at the end we get the sticker (40:05 - 40:10)
pack that's a lot less controlled I was (40:07 - 40:12)
going to say yeah you could also just (40:10 - 40:14)
put okay you want the stickers I was (40:12 - 40:14)
going to say you could also just P your (40:14 - 40:16)
switches out in line and play we could (40:14 - 40:20)
just also play while in line yeah (40:16 - 40:23)
yeah um but if you didn't like there's a (40:20 - 40:25)
lot of people that go to packs by (40:23 - 40:27)
themselves like I feel like that's not (40:25 - 40:28)
talked about a lot I feel like the (40:27 - 40:31)
amount of people that I see in Solo (40:28 - 40:32)
situations or not with any groups of (40:31 - 40:34)
friends is very high and especially when (40:32 - 40:36)
you're waiting in line um like I was in (40:34 - 40:39)
a group of four and there were in front (40:36 - 40:41)
of us was groups of three and behind us (40:39 - 40:43)
were a group of three and so like the (40:41 - 40:44)
packs people would be like all right (40:43 - 40:46)
who's solo who's solo okay we're GNA (40:44 - 40:48)
take this solo person move it into a (40:46 - 40:50)
group like there's a lot of solo people (40:48 - 40:52)
at packs so I could imagine like oh (40:50 - 40:53)
maybe I want to get into the VGC and (40:52 - 40:55)
you're waiting in line and they're like (40:53 - 40:56)
okay let's find two solo people we're (40:55 - 40:58)
going to put you together we going to (40:56 - 41:00)
teach you how to do this (40:58 - 41:04)
um by no means do I think like that (41:00 - 41:06)
scenario was Primetime ready but like (41:04 - 41:08)
they kind of have to start doing it to (41:06 - 41:09)
like figure (41:08 - 41:13)
out how to do it well it took them (41:09 - 41:15)
really long with te CG to be like you (41:13 - 41:16)
know what maybe we shouldn't be giving (41:15 - 41:18)
people 60 card (41:16 - 41:20)
decks maybe we should cut it down to 30 (41:18 - 41:23)
and have the 30 deck way more (41:20 - 41:25)
controlled um for so for people to have (41:23 - 41:26)
a good (41:25 - 41:29)
time (41:26 - 41:32)
yeah it seems like that they they could (41:29 - 41:34)
be on the road to that with the VGC if (41:32 - 41:36)
this was really the first time that they (41:34 - 41:38)
did it and but it does seem like there (41:36 - 41:40)
should be some more control there if (41:38 - 41:42)
they're going into a demo and they're (41:40 - 41:44)
going to like in the TCG they're (41:42 - 41:46)
teaching you how to play the game and in (41:44 - 41:49)
the VGC like you said the game itself (41:46 - 41:51)
doesn't really teach you how to play the (41:49 - 41:54)
VGC well right the story doesn't as we (41:51 - 41:55)
were just saying we're just attacking (41:54 - 41:58)
the entire time until you know you to (41:55 - 42:02)
the end so some needs to do that if (41:58 - 42:04)
especially if it's a demo because if (42:02 - 42:08)
they're going to demo and want you to (42:04 - 42:10)
get into it you may enjoy it in the (42:08 - 42:14)
moment but it would be helpful if it's (42:10 - 42:15)
something that's geared toward and then (42:14 - 42:18)
you can go and use this in when you go (42:15 - 42:20)
play the VGC when you go home and it's (42:18 - 42:22)
not like they're going to sit down and (42:20 - 42:23)
be like well I played it this way and (42:22 - 42:24)
then they're just going to get (42:23 - 42:26)
completely crushed when it's like oh (42:24 - 42:27)
they're playing people who are actually (42:26 - 42:31)
playing it differently than the demo (42:27 - 42:31)
went yeah I I also don't think the (42:31 - 42:38)
stickers were like a good enough (42:35 - 42:41)
prize Well if this is new and if it was (42:38 - 42:42)
last minute I'm not too surprised by (42:41 - 42:45)
that but I do like that this is starting (42:42 - 42:47)
to exist as someone who would love to (42:45 - 42:49)
have more opportunities to (42:47 - 42:53)
learn uh about VGC ESP in situations (42:49 - 42:54)
like that if they were giving the pin (42:53 - 42:59)
out for both the TCG and the V VGC I (42:54 - 43:00)
would have chosen the VGC and I would (42:59 - 43:05)
have learned tried to learn more there (43:00 - 43:06)
you know if they were giving the pin out (43:05 - 43:07)
for both I would have probably just (43:06 - 43:12)
gotten to VGC cuz I just the TCG is is (43:07 - 43:15)
longer it's like it's like 30 plus (43:12 - 43:18)
minutes cuz they they do have to like (43:15 - 43:19)
teach (43:18 - 43:22)
you and you have to like Shuffle and (43:19 - 43:25)
draw like should be teaching you in the (43:22 - 43:28)
VGC as well exactly I mean (43:25 - 43:29)
I'm sure they (43:28 - 43:31)
are to (43:29 - 43:34)
some but like I they didn't need to (43:31 - 43:36)
teach me I knew what to do yeah that's (43:34 - 43:38)
the tricky thing you you already knew (43:36 - 43:41)
what to do um and I'm sure they probably (43:38 - 43:44)
are able to kind of alter how much they (43:41 - 43:48)
are interacting in the TCG too like how (43:44 - 43:50)
much they're teaching a (43:48 - 43:53)
person yeah it's it's I think it's it's (43:50 - 43:55)
definitely in the VGC part like the (43:53 - 43:57)
person I played against wasn't like (43:55 - 43:59)
super knowledgeable so I was like you (43:57 - 44:02)
can like and and the person was like do (43:59 - 44:05)
you want help and they were like yes and (44:02 - 44:07)
so it was it was like them talking but (44:05 - 44:09)
it was also like me like hearing them (44:07 - 44:12)
talk and I was like I don't want an (44:09 - 44:14)
unfair Advantage cuz like oh it sounds (44:12 - 44:15)
like oh you should Swap this out and I (44:14 - 44:17)
was like okay I'm gonna pretend I didn't (44:15 - 44:18)
hear this I'm just going to commit to (44:17 - 44:20)
the move I said I was going to before I (44:18 - 44:22)
heard like you should Swap this out but (44:20 - 44:24)
that's probably the same on the TCG side (44:22 - 44:27)
yeah I mean to think that most of these (44:24 - 44:29)
people going into this demo aren't (44:27 - 44:33)
people who play the VGC or play Pokemon (44:29 - 44:36)
8 to 10 hours a day for their job you (44:33 - 44:39)
know so like you are kind of a a bit of (44:36 - 44:41)
an outlier there as someone playing the (44:39 - 44:44)
demo I think I also don't know if (44:41 - 44:47)
like cuz I I I overheard like one person (44:44 - 44:48)
being like yeah they let me bring my own (44:47 - 44:50)
team and I just creamed the other guy (44:48 - 44:52)
just destroyed him and it was like I (44:50 - 44:54)
don't know that's what you don't right (44:52 - 44:56)
yeah yeah yeah that's what you so I (44:54 - 44:57)
don't know if they played against (44:56 - 44:59)
somebody they knew or was it just a (44:57 - 45:00)
random person because like I don't think (44:59 - 45:02)
that's fair like I when I look through (45:00 - 45:04)
all those teams and I look through the (45:02 - 45:05)
the balance and stuff like there's no (45:04 - 45:08)
way these teams can like they were good (45:05 - 45:10)
against each other like I saw like the (45:08 - 45:13)
the paper rock scissors thing that she (45:10 - 45:16)
built for these teams by no means do I (45:13 - 45:18)
think these teams were like bad in the (45:16 - 45:19)
sense of (45:18 - 45:23)
like bad they were just not competitive (45:19 - 45:26)
teams right they were just not built for (45:23 - 45:28)
what you see the this weekend and what (45:26 - 45:30)
was where were they Vancouver this (45:28 - 45:33)
weekend Toronto Vancouver it it kind of (45:30 - 45:35)
sounds like they should maybe not let (45:33 - 45:37)
people use their own teams and maybe (45:35 - 45:40)
should not only have the pre-built teams (45:37 - 45:43)
but should have a set like a (45:40 - 45:46)
preet three Pokemon that are being or (45:43 - 45:49)
four you can tell I don't feed youc four (45:46 - 45:53)
Pokemon that are being chosen to send to (45:49 - 45:55)
send out kind of like they stack your (45:53 - 45:59)
hand for the first draw yeah on the TCG (45:55 - 46:00)
side because on the TCG side you can't (45:59 - 46:02)
bring your own 30 card deck right you're (46:00 - 46:06)
only playing the 30 deck give so just (46:02 - 46:08)
let me open my binder real quick yeah (46:06 - 46:09)
otherwise you could have you have the (46:08 - 46:12)
same myON deck real quick I have this (46:09 - 46:16)
special 30 card deck all pre-built (46:12 - 46:19)
yeah using boss's orders on turn (46:16 - 46:21)
[Laughter] (46:19 - 46:24)
one it was that was like the highlight (46:21 - 46:25)
of packs I (46:24 - 46:28)
think that it it did come across that (46:25 - 46:31)
Pokemon and Nintendo put effort into a (46:28 - 46:35)
convention that I I have felt slightly (46:31 - 46:40)
on the down slide since (46:35 - 46:43)
Co like I've been to two packes after Co (46:40 - 46:45)
three packes after Co (46:43 - 46:48)
and seven plus before covid and (46:45 - 46:51)
obviously it's not the (46:48 - 46:53)
same uh like so many vendors have pulled (46:51 - 46:56)
out and have not returned and and (46:53 - 46:58)
whatnot (46:56 - 47:00)
but uh it was (46:58 - 47:03)
okay um it's (47:00 - 47:06)
just I could I could see somebody being (47:03 - 47:08)
disappointed flying out there having (47:06 - 47:10)
terrible weather having to get (47:08 - 47:14)
Ubers not as many vendors as years (47:10 - 47:16)
before to be like ah this was like (47:14 - 47:18)
really expensive was there as many (47:16 - 47:20)
people there as the years before or was (47:18 - 47:23)
it also like a smaller (47:20 - 47:27)
crowd um it felt (47:23 - 47:32)
a good crowd but again not nearly as as (47:27 - 47:34)
as busy as (47:32 - 47:38)
preco like I remember walking PAX East (47:34 - 47:41)
is uh the the convention center is is (47:38 - 47:44)
surrounded by like a walk around that (47:41 - 47:45)
you could walk all the way around and (47:44 - 47:48)
like look down onto it uh which is (47:45 - 47:49)
really (47:48 - 47:52)
cool and those usually those H the (47:49 - 47:53)
hallways all around it where they have (47:52 - 47:55)
like the panels and the bathrooms and (47:53 - 47:56)
the (47:55 - 48:00)
food usually it feels like before Co (47:56 - 48:02)
that it was hard to walk through cuz (48:00 - 48:04)
there were so many people mhm and you (48:02 - 48:05)
would like turn the corner and that like (48:04 - 48:07)
whole hallway would be like pretty empty (48:05 - 48:11)
and you'd be like oh yeah it's not not (48:07 - 48:13)
nearly as crowded as it ever used to be (48:11 - 48:15)
not what it used to (48:13 - 48:17)
be which you could argue is maybe (48:15 - 48:19)
slightly better that you're not bumping (48:17 - 48:21)
shoulders with somebody (48:19 - 48:24)
every every five steps yeah I'd (48:21 - 48:25)
appreciate that (48:24 - 48:28)
but each (48:25 - 48:30)
it sounds like there were still some fun (48:28 - 48:31)
things but maybe not worth a cross (48:30 - 48:33)
country trip to (48:31 - 48:37)
it yeah I mean I wanted to for my (48:33 - 48:38)
personal experience I wanted to go like (48:37 - 48:40)
Thursday Friday and then like just spend (48:38 - 48:42)
like Saturday in Boston like doing (48:40 - 48:45)
Boston things and it's just hard to do (48:42 - 48:46)
it when it's (48:45 - 48:49)
pouring like we when I took the train (48:46 - 48:52)
back to to my friend Nick's house the (48:49 - 48:55)
the conductor was like oh the tracks are (48:52 - 48:56)
flooded here we're going to have to go a (48:55 - 48:57)
little slow (48:56 - 49:00)
uh we're like halfway (48:57 - 49:03)
underwater Oh no I've never been on the (49:00 - 49:06)
subway going like five cuz the tracks (49:03 - 49:08)
were flooded they had to like slowly go (49:06 - 49:10)
through the it was just raining so much (49:08 - 49:14)
in Boston wow and it was like we went we (49:10 - 49:17)
wanted we went to like a really nice (49:14 - 49:18)
pizza place like Regina's which I guess (49:17 - 49:21)
is like famous in Boston for having (49:18 - 49:22)
Boston pizza and then it was like okay (49:21 - 49:24)
well we want to go to like the famous (49:22 - 49:27)
pastry place which is a f minute walk so (49:24 - 49:29)
do we walk five minutes of the pouring (49:27 - 49:31)
rain or do we like try to get an Uber (49:29 - 49:34)
which would be like 13 minutes and then (49:31 - 49:40)
like 15 bucks MH it's like I just walk (49:34 - 49:42)
and then we got out of the pastry place (49:40 - 49:44)
and was like the station's on another F (49:42 - 49:47)
minute walk and it's still pouring do we (49:44 - 49:50)
wait for an Uber like just walk again I (49:47 - 49:52)
guess we're already someone who grew up (49:50 - 49:54)
in the Pacific Northwest 5 minutes (49:52 - 49:56)
walking and the rain sounds like nothing (49:54 - 49:58)
but the rain over there is harder so it (49:56 - 50:00)
was probably really coming down oh yeah (49:58 - 50:04)
it was it was also like Boston's like (50:00 - 50:05)
apparently Boston doesn't have like (50:04 - 50:07)
storm drains anywhere so you'd like get (50:05 - 50:10)
to a point and it would be like huge (50:07 - 50:11)
well they did say it was potential (50:10 - 50:15)
flooding accurate (50:11 - 50:18)
oh we'll blame Niantic on the weather (50:15 - 50:20)
though yeah always it's always their (50:18 - 50:22)
fault always niantic's fault for the bad (50:20 - 50:24)
weather all right let's take a break uh (50:22 - 50:26)
we come back we actually will talk about (50:24 - 50:27)
Pokémon go (50:26 - 50:30)
um I think April is exciting to some (50:27 - 50:35)
people so uh we will be right back and (50:30 - 50:37)
we are back from our break my brain (50:35 - 50:40)
broke there for a second (50:37 - 50:43)
uh scarland Violet news uh we actually (50:40 - 50:46)
got news between the break so that (50:43 - 50:48)
worked out well uh there there is some (50:46 - 50:51)
news before that okay so this event is (50:48 - 50:52)
going to be gone by the time this (50:51 - 50:54)
podcast goes up but a new event is (50:52 - 50:55)
starting but I do want to talk about (50:54 - 50:57)
this event real quick just to mention (50:55 - 50:58)
that (50:57 - 51:01)
this first time this has happened uh so (50:58 - 51:03)
get ready to challenge brute Bonnet and (51:01 - 51:05)
iron hands and teror (51:03 - 51:08)
raids there's still a bunch of paradox (51:05 - 51:10)
Pokemon they haven't done yet in Terror (51:08 - 51:13)
raids like I don't think we've had (51:10 - 51:16)
slyther wings iron moth maybe we (51:13 - 51:18)
have I don't think so we haven't had (51:16 - 51:22)
Valiant or roaring Moon I know that for (51:18 - 51:27)
sure um but no thought we had track at (51:22 - 51:29)
this point no I think we've had slyther (51:27 - 51:31)
wings and iron moth but definitely not (51:29 - 51:33)
roaring (51:31 - 51:36)
Moon and iron Val they didn't do that oh (51:33 - 51:37)
right I was saying they should have done (51:36 - 51:40)
that with Paradox Rift with the TCG oh (51:37 - 51:43)
uh because it was those two beater I (51:40 - 51:45)
don't think we've gotten Thorns either (51:43 - 51:46)
everyone always forgets about Thorns (51:45 - 51:48)
Thorns hasn't right because I feel like (51:46 - 51:49)
I (51:48 - 51:51)
would and no Sandy had Slither wi and (51:49 - 51:55)
iron moth iron moth no (51:51 - 51:59)
Sandy yeah we've had flutter and iron (51:55 - 52:01)
julus mhm we've had great we've had (51:59 - 52:03)
great Tusk and iron Treads that was the (52:01 - 52:06)
one that broke it (52:03 - 52:06)
all those were the two trouble makers so (52:06 - 52:13)
other than walking wake and iron (52:10 - 52:16)
leaves for the first time ever they (52:13 - 52:19)
started dropping herba mystica with the (52:16 - 52:22)
sevenstar Blastoise Venus or Charizard (52:19 - 52:25)
raids and a lot of people including (52:22 - 52:26)
myself thought they were going to go (52:25 - 52:30)
back to no AA but this is the first (52:26 - 52:33)
fstar event not to be confused with (52:30 - 52:34)
normal festar raids because those can (52:33 - 52:38)
drop bbba whenever this is the first (52:34 - 52:41)
five-star promoted event that did drop (52:38 - 52:43)
urbom mystica it only dropped sweet and (52:41 - 52:47)
it was only a 3% chance um but that is a (52:43 - 52:49)
good sign that they are going to (52:47 - 52:53)
continue herba mystica because it's been (52:49 - 52:56)
four events in a row now or four (52:53 - 52:58)
different raids in a row now with urbam (52:56 - 53:00)
mystica (52:58 - 53:05)
so sweet not super great I mean all urb (53:00 - 53:07)
mystica is fine but like salty is the (53:05 - 53:11)
easier one for shinies and then spicy is (53:07 - 53:13)
better for like humongo and stuff which (53:11 - 53:16)
is what I care about but yeah that that (53:13 - 53:19)
event should be over if you didn't get (53:16 - 53:21)
brute Bonnet or iron hands and you're (53:19 - 53:22)
still (53:21 - 53:24)
playing I don't I don't know what are (53:22 - 53:28)
you doing maybe it'll come back someday (53:24 - 53:28)
um but that event is getting replaced (53:29 - 53:32)
with a new event that just got announced (53:30 - 53:34)
while we're recording maybe we should (53:32 - 53:36)
start recording at (53:34 - 53:36)
night the pattern the pattern uh this is (53:37 - 53:43)
a new Mass outbreak event will take (53:41 - 53:46)
place from Friday March 29th to Sunday (53:43 - 53:47)
March (53:46 - 53:52)
31st uh it will be Pichu and haini in (53:47 - 53:56)
Pala Munchlax and Riolu in kitami and (53:52 - 53:59)
elid and and Magby in (53:56 - 54:03)
blueberry um and they will have the (53:59 - 54:05)
normal shiny odds because if they did (54:03 - 54:07)
have increased they would say increased (54:05 - 54:09)
but they will be more likely to have the (54:07 - 54:12)
Vigor Mark which is the mark that looks (54:09 - 54:15)
like the little like muscles (54:12 - 54:19)
like like vigoroth but (54:15 - 54:22)
muscles (54:19 - 54:25)
what yeah got I got that part okay okay (54:22 - 54:29)
good glad we got there (54:25 - 54:29)
together we're there I (54:30 - 54:34)
guess uh toxel didn't make the cut for (54:35 - 54:42)
baby Pokemon I guess not time or toxel (54:37 - 54:45)
the viiger mark gives the title of the (54:42 - 54:50)
Lively so you could get Riolu the (54:45 - 54:52)
Lively I think Riolu is probably the (54:50 - 54:53)
best one out of this everyone just got a (54:52 - 54:57)
free shiny Riolu like four months ago (54:53 - 55:00)
Prett shiny Lucario how uh how many of (54:57 - 55:02)
the baby Pokemon did you say you said (55:00 - 55:05)
two in each region yeah so there miss in (55:02 - 55:08)
a bunch of baby Pokemon they did Skip (55:05 - 55:12)
some like bonsly is in the game yeah (55:08 - 55:15)
myam junior is not in the game My no no (55:12 - 55:18)
M Junior no no M Junior that's (55:15 - 55:21)
right but yeah uh the toxel is in the (55:18 - 55:23)
game toxel would have been more exciting (55:21 - 55:25)
than all of these let's be let's be real (55:23 - 55:28)
here (55:25 - 55:28)
what there plenty of toxil out and (55:30 - 55:36)
around Pala it's it's there a lot these (55:32 - 55:39)
are more exciting than that I don't know (55:36 - 55:41)
I don't like the Pokemon with the diaper (55:39 - 55:44)
I don't like toxel very (55:41 - 55:46)
much this is the breaking news of the (55:44 - 55:50)
podcast Hannah doesn't like (55:46 - 55:50)
toxel wow okay I mean tox tox's fine I (55:50 - 55:57)
think they chose good (55:56 - 56:01)
Pokémon I think that a lot of people (55:57 - 56:03)
probably have the shinies for these (56:01 - 56:05)
because almost all of them have been (56:03 - 56:09)
Community Day Pokemon (56:05 - 56:12)
but still actually all of them have been (56:09 - 56:15)
or not rol not all of them yeah not rolu (56:12 - 56:17)
or Munch you're right yeah and Munchlax (56:15 - 56:20)
yeah kidam is going to be the best (56:17 - 56:21)
choice there unless you have won the (56:20 - 56:24)
ogre atin and already have a shiny (56:21 - 56:26)
Munchlax yeah but I had just been (56:24 - 56:28)
thinking I (56:26 - 56:30)
was uh hoping they would do more of (56:28 - 56:34)
these mass outbreaks events so I'm glad (56:30 - 56:39)
to see it happening again same I'm a (56:34 - 56:41)
much bigger fan of the mouse outbreak (56:39 - 56:44)
events than the than the raids honestly (56:41 - 56:46)
just for for how I play the game I I (56:44 - 56:48)
really enjoy the mass outbreaks so good (56:46 - 56:51)
to see more of them popping up I like (56:48 - 56:55)
when they have increased Mark um and (56:51 - 56:56)
everyone should have a bunch of urbom (56:55 - 57:00)
Mystic since we had three straight weeks (56:56 - 57:02)
promoted (57:00 - 57:04)
every some of them were harder than (57:02 - 57:09)
others yeah I will say um if you still (57:04 - 57:11)
care about the item (57:09 - 57:13)
printer uh you're probably going to see (57:11 - 57:15)
a bunch of YouTubers say chansy and (57:13 - 57:20)
haini they're wrong please note that uh (57:15 - 57:25)
so chance the haini does give 68% dust (57:20 - 57:29)
but Magby also gives 68% dust uh so it's (57:25 - 57:31)
the same and uh (57:29 - 57:34)
elid gives (57:31 - 57:37)
45% so if you're on blueberry Academy (57:34 - 57:40)
and you're just switching between like (57:37 - 57:42)
two of them or you're just like knocking (57:40 - 57:45)
out for the dust or whatever uh (57:42 - 57:47)
blueberry those that combination of (57:45 - 57:49)
those two (57:47 - 57:52)
are probably what you want to clear out (57:49 - 57:54)
well how I've always done it is like cuz (57:52 - 57:56)
in my head I'm like I'm not going to (57:54 - 57:58)
hunt El or Magby I have those Community (57:56 - 58:00)
Day they're gen one they're not super (57:58 - 58:02)
exciting but I will still go there and I (58:00 - 58:04)
will still just clear that all out for (58:02 - 58:06)
the the (58:04 - 58:08)
dust and then I will like probably (58:06 - 58:13)
switch over to like do probably rioli (58:08 - 58:15)
Riolu (58:13 - 58:19)
um but you don't if if you're sick of (58:15 - 58:22)
getting shiny chanses or shiny Happ (58:19 - 58:25)
beanies do the (58:22 - 58:28)
Magby (58:25 - 58:28)
it's the same as it's the same as (58:30 - 58:34)
Blissey um so that's exciting uh I think (58:31 - 58:36)
Hannah mentioned before we started that (58:34 - 58:38)
Easter is coming up so this is probably (58:36 - 58:40)
in in response to like baby Pokemon (58:38 - 58:43)
Easter that kind of (58:40 - 58:43)
stuff makes sense it makes makes perfect (58:43 - 58:50)
sense uh what so we'll have I mean April (58:47 - 58:51)
1st is the day after that is that still (58:50 - 58:54)
bedf day is that that is that a Pokemon (58:51 - 58:57)
company thing or is that I don't I think (58:54 - 58:59)
it's a Pokemon company thing there's (58:57 - 59:01)
been a video on YouTube that's why they (58:59 - 59:03)
did the special delivery (59:01 - 59:06)
bedf last April or the April before that (59:03 - 59:08)
for the (59:06 - 59:08)
TCG I think it's a Pokemon company thing (59:09 - 59:16)
I don't remember what they did last year (59:12 - 59:17)
they (59:16 - 59:20)
did I the year (59:17 - 59:24)
before 2022 was when the bit video came (59:20 - 59:25)
out but that wasn't actually in April (59:24 - 59:27)
1st (59:25 - 59:28)
I think they it came out a little bit (59:27 - 59:31)
before April 1st oh POF day is July (59:28 - 59:37)
1st oh my bad Pokemon go yeah no that (59:31 - 59:38)
makes sense because I remember streaming (59:37 - 59:41)
the bedf event and getting a shiny bedf (59:38 - 59:42)
and if it was in April that would (59:41 - 59:43)
probably been (59:42 - 59:46)
like too (59:43 - 59:49)
cold yeah it was definitely it was July (59:46 - 59:51)
1 why do I I felt like for some reason (59:49 - 59:54)
April Fool's Day had a bedf something to (59:51 - 59:56)
it because the bed event was really (59:54 - 59:58)
interesting Pokemon go has done a number (59:56 - 60:00)
of April Fool's Day events I think it's (59:58 - 60:03)
changed up now and then yeah okay (60:00 - 60:05)
usually it's (60:03 - 60:08)
ditto there was a ditto event last (60:05 - 60:11)
year all of our sentences are ending (60:08 - 60:13)
with question marks yeah I don't it's (60:11 - 60:14)
been so long it's been like there's been (60:13 - 60:17)
like they didn't do a Pokemon go event (60:14 - 60:20)
obviously the first year I don't think (60:17 - 60:22)
and then what was it the second year (60:20 - 60:24)
they did the pixel thing which was (60:22 - 60:26)
pretty cool yeah I missed that then they (60:24 - 60:29)
did a merro thing in Pokémon go where (60:26 - 60:30)
then like half the internet couldn't (60:29 - 60:32)
figure out if people were trolling or (60:30 - 60:36)
not if merro was shiny or (60:32 - 60:40)
not so I guess success there yeah it (60:36 - 60:43)
looks like since then they've done ditto (60:40 - 60:47)
and the Pidgey was the Pidgey last year (60:43 - 60:50)
ye ditto was in 2022 so there was a (60:47 - 60:53)
ditto event for April fools in (60:50 - 60:56)
2022 uh Pidgey pandemonium was (60:53 - 60:59)
pendemonium was (60:56 - 61:04)
2023 mhm yeah double XL and double x uh (60:59 - 61:09)
s Pidgey were had an increased (61:04 - 61:09)
chance well since we're talking about (61:09 - 61:13)
Pokemon go we'll get the Pokemon Go News (61:11 - 61:16)
out of the way here there they did post (61:13 - 61:18)
the April content update which I feel (61:16 - 61:22)
like they posted earlier than (61:18 - 61:24)
normal but really (61:22 - 61:29)
depends um they're saying that (61:24 - 61:33)
uh tapu bulu will have a featured attack (61:29 - 61:36)
of Nature's Madness uh from April 4th (61:33 - 61:38)
through April 9th will be the sizable (61:36 - 61:42)
surprise event April 7th will be (61:38 - 61:44)
Community Day classic which I think we (61:42 - 61:47)
know that as (61:44 - 61:50)
salamance April 12th through the 17th (61:47 - 61:51)
will be (61:50 - 61:53)
bugout which I don't think they've (61:51 - 61:57)
talked about yet no they have done (61:53 - 61:59)
similar events before though yeah yeah (61:57 - 62:01)
that because that had the the the bug (61:59 - 62:04)
catching net you could have as a (62:01 - 62:07)
pose April 13th will be Mega Heracross (62:04 - 62:09)
raid (62:07 - 62:12)
day which should be exciting for a lot (62:09 - 62:15)
of people since that is a version new (62:12 - 62:17)
Mega yeah new Mega and you can only get (62:15 - 62:19)
Heracross in (62:17 - 62:23)
like small parts of Florida and (62:19 - 62:27)
Brazil and Mexico in Mexico yeah Brazil (62:23 - 62:30)
yeah well is it in Brazil I think it's (62:27 - 62:31)
Brazil I think it just reaches up that (62:30 - 62:33)
far definitely in Mexico because I have (62:31 - 62:35)
multiple hair across from friends who (62:33 - 62:37)
had traveled to Mexico and then traded (62:35 - 62:38)
them to (62:37 - 62:42)
me April 20th will be commu (62:38 - 62:44)
day did they did they say which Pokemon (62:42 - 62:48)
that was no nope they didn't (62:44 - 62:55)
okay uh April 22 is sub sustainability (62:48 - 62:58)
week which I can't remember what they (62:55 - 63:01)
did for that last time wasn't it trouish (62:58 - 63:03)
one year or something yeah a lot of (63:01 - 63:06)
poison type Pokemon and grass types I (63:03 - 63:10)
think there is a hatch day on April (63:06 - 63:12)
28th (63:10 - 63:14)
which which baby Pokemon haven't they (63:12 - 63:16)
done (63:14 - 63:19)
yet so like one thing that's kind of (63:16 - 63:21)
interesting is so for instance the (63:19 - 63:23)
spotlight hour of April (63:21 - 63:27)
23rd is trubbish that's during (63:23 - 63:29)
sustainability week okay the spotlight (63:27 - 63:32)
hour of April 30th is Clefairy which is (63:29 - 63:34)
right after hatch day two days after (63:32 - 63:37)
hatch day like the bugout the week that (63:34 - 63:39)
the bugout event is the spotlight hour (63:37 - 63:41)
is actually three Pokemon it's Caterpie (63:39 - 63:42)
Weedle and (63:41 - 63:44)
worle uh so these are kind of going (63:42 - 63:47)
along with obviously going along with (63:44 - 63:48)
like the weeks are you thinking they (63:47 - 63:51)
haven't done a Clea hatch (63:48 - 63:53)
day no they haven't it sounding like (63:51 - 63:56)
that would be great Spotlight hour is (63:53 - 63:59)
the hint we we're going off of yeah that (63:56 - 64:02)
would be I'd be okay with that or (63:59 - 64:04)
the (64:02 - 64:08)
yeah um tapu Lele will be April 3rd in (64:04 - 64:12)
raid hours Cartana and celesa will be (64:08 - 64:14)
April 10th Northern Hemisphere for (64:12 - 64:17)
Cartana southern hemisphere for (64:14 - 64:20)
cila then tapu bulu will be the 17th and (64:17 - 64:22)
the (64:20 - 64:24)
24th (64:22 - 64:27)
um seems like a lot of events for (64:24 - 64:31)
April yeah and Cartana and celesa can be (64:27 - 64:33)
shiny which would be the first time for (64:31 - 64:36)
both of them right yep (64:33 - 64:39)
yeah (64:36 - 64:42)
cool um we did we did learn about the (64:39 - 64:44)
sizeable we didn't talk about that last (64:42 - 64:46)
week right the sizable yeah do you have (64:44 - 64:48)
it in front of you surprises yeah so the (64:46 - 64:51)
sizable surprises event um that's yeah (64:48 - 64:54)
April 4th through April 9th um it looks (64:51 - 64:56)
like it's going to be uh two times catch (64:54 - 64:59)
XP with nice throws or better uh (64:56 - 65:00)
there'll be an increased chance of (64:59 - 65:02)
encountering extra extra small and extra (65:00 - 65:04)
extra large Pokemon uh an increased (65:02 - 65:07)
chance to encounter shiny (65:04 - 65:09)
wmer uh and then there'll be some wild (65:07 - 65:11)
encounters just some special wild (65:09 - 65:13)
encounters like special wild encounters (65:11 - 65:15)
like Diglett (65:13 - 65:19)
um Wimer jol tick um Tynamo cutie fly (65:15 - 65:22)
wimpod and sea tottle um some trainers (65:19 - 65:24)
may even encounter Onyx or (65:22 - 65:26)
Snorlax um and then wimp pod will be (65:24 - 65:29)
able to be shiny now uh starting with (65:26 - 65:32)
this event as well um onear raids will (65:29 - 65:35)
have fungus clink esper Tad bulb three (65:32 - 65:38)
star raids will have alolan exeggutor (65:35 - 65:41)
gallerian wheezing Gyarados and Snorlax (65:38 - 65:43)
five star raids will have celisa in the (65:41 - 65:45)
Southern Hemisphere and Cartana in the (65:43 - 65:47)
Northern Hemisphere and then Mega raids (65:45 - 65:49)
will be Mega Charizard (65:47 - 65:51)
X um and there'll be (65:49 - 65:55)
some both these five stars are weak to (65:51 - 65:57)
fire (65:55 - 65:59)
makes sense there you go um and then (65:57 - 66:01)
there'll be collection challenges and (65:59 - 66:04)
Poké stop showcases as well so should be (66:01 - 66:06)
a should be a good event um especially (66:04 - 66:09)
with the increased chance I think of the (66:06 - 66:12)
um extra extra large Pokemon people more (66:09 - 66:14)
people doing those showcases I feel like (66:12 - 66:17)
since the Pikachu reward came out and (66:14 - 66:19)
increased chance of extra extra small (66:17 - 66:22)
Pokemon theoretically someday we will be (66:19 - 66:26)
able to win a Showcase with somay extra (66:22 - 66:28)
small (66:26 - 66:30)
Pokemon yeah I was actually with (66:28 - 66:31)
somebody this weekend and they're like (66:30 - 66:33)
why am I keeping the extra extra small (66:31 - 66:35)
they're never in showcases and I was (66:33 - 66:38)
like one one day they might be yeah (66:35 - 66:40)
maybe no definitely as somebody who (66:38 - 66:43)
transferred all of their extra extra (66:40 - 66:46)
large Pokemon about I don't know six it (66:43 - 66:49)
was right before showcases like came out (66:46 - 66:51)
uh yeah make sure to hold on to all of (66:49 - 66:53)
them cuz I was like I'm collecting too (66:51 - 66:54)
many different things I got to get rid (66:53 - 66:56)
of some stuff I'm going to get rid of (66:54 - 66:57)
Shadow Pokemon I'm going to get rid of (66:56 - 66:59)
my XXL (66:57 - 67:01)
Pokemon and now I wish I had not done (66:59 - 67:04)
that yeah you dropped the ball there I (67:01 - 67:07)
really did it really (67:04 - 67:09)
did uh all right (67:07 - 67:11)
final wait hold on where's my show notes (67:09 - 67:12)
final thing I think this is the final (67:11 - 67:16)
thing oh yeah okay final thing is uh (67:12 - 67:19)
this is an article off aftermath do site (67:16 - 67:21)
which probably pulled from somewhere (67:19 - 67:23)
else no I think this is the actual (67:21 - 67:29)
interview um so this is uh don (67:23 - 67:34)
mcen mc mc mc mc M Mone I don't know how (67:29 - 67:36)
to say his last name wait how is it how (67:34 - 67:37)
is it (67:36 - 67:43)
spelled m c g w n originally from (67:37 - 67:47)
Montreal mwan mwan oh that sounds better (67:43 - 67:51)
sure we just call him Don uh Don worked (67:47 - 67:57)
for both Bungie and the Pokemon company (67:51 - 68:00)
uh and they ended up as the head lawyer (67:57 - 68:03)
for what was Microsoft game Studio at a (68:00 - 68:06)
certain point we don't have to bore you (68:03 - 68:07)
with all that other stuff we got to get (68:06 - 68:10)
to the good stuff here uh well at Bungie (68:07 - 68:11)
they were the (68:10 - 68:14)
general Council and that at Pokemon (68:11 - 68:16)
company they were Chief legal officer in (68:14 - 68:20)
business Affairs and they say they at (68:16 - 68:24)
Pokemon ran a team of 20 lawyers and non (68:20 - 68:26)
lawyer pargal at the head of office in (68:24 - 68:29)
bellw as well as London and at Bungie (68:26 - 68:32)
that was eight people uh globally (68:29 - 68:35)
throughout their team uh he also Don (68:32 - 68:37)
also says at Pokemon I oversaw customer (68:35 - 68:40)
service team mostly because I was in the (68:37 - 68:43)
department of things that can go wrong (68:40 - 68:44)
spent a lot of the time on the road (68:43 - 68:46)
because at my time during Pokemon the (68:44 - 68:48)
brand returned to International (68:46 - 68:51)
Juggernaut status because of Pokémon go (68:48 - 68:53)
a lot of privacy Regulators around the (68:51 - 68:55)
world wanted to talk to the company so (68:53 - 68:57)
that means I would have to to go to (68:55 - 69:00)
them uh don also did things like factory (68:57 - 69:03)
tours of manufacturing facilities uh (69:00 - 69:05)
making sure there was no child labor in (69:03 - 69:06)
there (69:05 - 69:13)
Etc take that crumble cookie um (69:06 - 69:13)
and a whole (69:13 - 69:19)
different it's a whole different (69:16 - 69:21)
conversation they were responsible for (69:19 - 69:24)
event security (69:21 - 69:28)
uh which had they he Don is saying uh (69:24 - 69:30)
had more to worry about for the Pokemon (69:28 - 69:31)
world championships we would have (69:30 - 69:32)
players from around the world in one (69:31 - 69:35)
central location in today's America that (69:32 - 69:36)
means you have to plan for security (69:35 - 69:38)
incidents uh this involved a lot of (69:36 - 69:42)
travel Don was on the road for about 125 (69:38 - 69:44)
days a year and was also one of the (69:42 - 69:47)
producers on detective (69:44 - 69:50)
Pikachu uh the the (69:47 - 69:53)
movie not the (69:50 - 69:55)
game all of this stuff is like pretty (69:53 - 69:57)
boring uh (69:55 - 70:00)
logically uh they were a touch point for (69:57 - 70:03)
discussions with legendary for casting (70:00 - 70:03)
script (70:03 - 70:06)
approvals under the producer Guild of (70:03 - 70:10)
America those roles are considered (70:06 - 70:13)
producer and they say uh I can't let go (70:10 - 70:15)
without saying Justice Smith and (70:13 - 70:18)
Katherine Newton are two of the nicest (70:15 - 70:20)
people in the ENT entertainment world (70:18 - 70:23)
and I would love to work with them in a (70:20 - 70:23)
heartbeat so yeah I wish I wish there (70:23 - 70:27)
was like more there with the movie but (70:26 - 70:32)
it was just like touch point for script (70:27 - 70:35)
and some stuff but I would imagine there (70:32 - 70:38)
would be more touch points as well it's (70:35 - 70:40)
a pretty quick small interview I was (70:38 - 70:42)
honestly surprised when I clicked into (70:40 - 70:43)
it and started to scroll and saw that (70:42 - 70:47)
the scroll bar was so large (70:43 - 70:50)
um there's they don't delve into depth (70:47 - 70:54)
too much but I have seen Don talk about (70:50 - 70:56)
Pokemon stuff every now and then just on (70:54 - 70:59)
the interwebs and there's some inter (70:56 - 71:01)
interesting stuff that he's (70:59 - 71:05)
done yeah it feels like his his career (71:01 - 71:07)
path is more interesting than the work (71:05 - 71:11)
he did at Pokemon no the work he did at (71:07 - 71:13)
Pokemon sounded super interesting too (71:11 - 71:14)
he's the one who broke her the deal to (71:13 - 71:17)
make Pokemon go a (71:14 - 71:20)
thing kind of mentions it here in a (71:17 - 71:23)
oneliner in an interview but there's (71:20 - 71:25)
maybe it's just because I have interest (71:23 - 71:27)
in legal side of (71:25 - 71:30)
stuff but there was a lot of issues (71:27 - 71:33)
getting that set up (71:30 - 71:33)
there yeah I would imagine that would be (71:33 - 71:39)
huge actually with Pokemon go and having (71:36 - 71:42)
to think about how that's going to work (71:39 - 71:45)
with an app like tracking your location (71:42 - 71:48)
and things and then having all the (71:45 - 71:49)
different regulations around the (71:48 - 71:50)
different countries that are going to (71:49 - 71:52)
have that game and then being such a big (71:50 - 71:55)
part of that game I feel would be huge (71:52 - 71:57)
on the one one story at one point where (71:55 - 72:01)
they had to work out uh how Pokemon (71:57 - 72:04)
would or wouldn't spawn in the ocean for (72:01 - 72:06)
when people were out there on cruises (72:04 - 72:08)
and I believe the solution was that they (72:06 - 72:11)
worked out to put Pokemon on the largest (72:08 - 72:14)
cruise line routes and that's it making (72:11 - 72:16)
sure that people wouldn't be jumping (72:14 - 72:18)
boat cruise lines (72:16 - 72:21)
rout at least at one (72:18 - 72:24)
point what wow I didn't realize that I (72:21 - 72:26)
did not realize (72:24 - 72:28)
never been on a cruise taking the wrong (72:26 - 72:31)
cruises he said at Pokemon I was taking (72:28 - 72:34)
out unlicensed merchandise outlets at (72:31 - 72:36)
Bungie I was taking down cheat (72:34 - 72:39)
vendors um I I looked at it I looked at (72:36 - 72:41)
it as helping fans get the most (72:39 - 72:44)
authentic experiences (72:41 - 72:44)
possible um the interviewer says before (72:44 - 72:49)
we wrap up something I've always (72:48 - 72:51)
wondered never got a chance to ask is (72:49 - 72:53)
how does the Pokemon company handle (72:51 - 72:55)
cease and desist letters uh with regard (72:53 - 72:57)
to Fan projects how do you find them (72:55 - 72:59)
where do you draw the line what is (72:57 - 73:01)
allowed um what does the company think (72:59 - 73:04)
needs to be shut down he says short (73:01 - 73:06)
answer thanks to you folks I would be (73:04 - 73:08)
sitting in my office minding my own (73:06 - 73:09)
business when someone from the company (73:08 - 73:12)
would send me a link to a news article (73:09 - 73:13)
or I would stumble upon it myself I (73:12 - 73:15)
teach entertainment law at the (73:13 - 73:16)
University of Washington so I say this (73:15 - 73:18)
to most my students the worst thing on (73:16 - 73:20)
earth is when your fan project gets (73:18 - 73:24)
pressed because now I know about (73:20 - 73:27)
you yeah um but that's not the end of (73:24 - 73:28)
the question Don goes on to say you (73:27 - 73:30)
don't send a takedown right away you (73:28 - 73:32)
wait to see if they get funded for a (73:30 - 73:34)
Kickstarter or something similar if they (73:32 - 73:36)
get funded that's when you engage (73:34 - 73:38)
because no one likes suing (73:36 - 73:41)
fans and that's usually how it goes for (73:38 - 73:43)
most of that stuff we've covered usually (73:41 - 73:45)
it's like there's this fan-made game (73:43 - 73:47)
getting made and then the second they (73:45 - 73:49)
put it behind a pay wall or they put (73:47 - 73:52)
microtransactions in it because I'm (73:49 - 73:55)
pretty sure the Metroid fan-made game (73:52 - 73:57)
went for six or seven (73:55 - 74:00)
years just fine and then as soon as they (73:57 - 74:03)
were like maybe give us some money (74:00 - 74:05)
Nintendo was like (74:03 - 74:08)
nope yeah well that's where it's much (74:05 - 74:11)
more Rock Solid anyways when when money (74:08 - 74:14)
is involved versus just a a project (74:11 - 74:15)
where you're not (74:14 - 74:18)
actually monetarily benefiting from it (74:15 - 74:19)
or at least (74:18 - 74:21)
directly benefiting from it it's a (74:19 - 74:24)
little bit more it doesn't look as good (74:21 - 74:26)
on the big company coming in and taking (74:24 - 74:29)
it down but then once the money aspect (74:26 - 74:33)
comes in uh it changes things (74:29 - 74:35)
legally well they they could definitely (74:33 - 74:37)
take it down before money happens it's (74:35 - 74:39)
just oh for sure but it such an easier (74:37 - 74:42)
it's not as like it looked like he said (74:39 - 74:44)
like it then it's you're just taking (74:42 - 74:47)
down some fans thing as as the big (74:44 - 74:49)
company it's a little it doesn't look as (74:47 - 74:51)
nice the perception isn't as good (74:49 - 74:54)
publicly um as when there's money (74:51 - 74:56)
involved (74:54 - 74:58)
it's a little bit it might not still (74:56 - 75:01)
look good publicly but there is a little (74:58 - 75:02)
bit (75:01 - 75:04)
more it's a little bit more like oh (75:02 - 75:06)
historically that's how that's gone down (75:04 - 75:08)
so I think people are a little bit more (75:06 - 75:10)
likely (75:08 - 75:12)
to not hate on the company as much when (75:10 - 75:15)
that happens versus if someone's not (75:12 - 75:16)
making any money and then the company (75:15 - 75:18)
comes in and just says you're done you (75:16 - 75:20)
know it doesn't it doesn't look as good (75:18 - 75:22)
in the public (75:20 - 75:22)
eye there was a (75:23 - 75:29)
uh after actually a Pax event one year (75:26 - 75:33)
this is probably like 10 years ago or we (75:29 - 75:35)
covered it on the podcast I know that (75:33 - 75:39)
for sure so um but there was like a bar (75:35 - 75:42)
in Seattle after packs that had like a (75:39 - 75:43)
Pokemon (75:42 - 75:46)
event with like Pokemon themed drinks (75:43 - 75:49)
and and (75:46 - 75:52)
whatever whatever you do at a bar but (75:49 - 75:55)
they charged a cover fee and it was (75:52 - 75:58)
normally not like a Pokemon bar it was (75:55 - 76:00)
like a it was like a gamer bar but they (75:58 - 76:03)
they went out to heavily advertise that (76:00 - 76:06)
this is like a Pokemon themed night with (76:03 - 76:08)
a cover fee and the anime was going to (76:06 - 76:09)
be on the TV and we're gonna have all (76:08 - 76:13)
these drinks and they (76:09 - 76:16)
got they got uh yelled at by Mr Pikachu (76:13 - 76:18)
for that and (76:16 - 76:21)
I don't think that bar stayed in (76:18 - 76:24)
business much longer after that ask (76:21 - 76:27)
interesting I do so I went to and I'm (76:24 - 76:28)
not going to now I'm not going to say (76:27 - 76:30)
the name of the event that I went to (76:28 - 76:32)
last year but I went to an event uh that (76:30 - 76:35)
did revolve around um the TCG to some (76:32 - 76:38)
extent and one of the things that they (76:35 - 76:40)
had at the event was you could buy drink (76:38 - 76:46)
at the bar that was Pokemon themed um (76:40 - 76:49)
and you also got a pack of cards when (76:46 - 76:53)
you bought the drink as well um and I I (76:49 - 76:54)
do wonder how that would factor into (76:53 - 76:57)
things interesting yeah because the (76:54 - 77:00)
person who um like the team that put (76:57 - 77:02)
that event together I would think that (77:00 - 77:04)
they they they would have worked with (77:02 - 77:05)
them I it's not like it's not like a (77:04 - 77:08)
secret thing so I I'm just interested in (77:05 - 77:12)
how that I wonder how that yeah Wonder (77:08 - 77:14)
licensing line is for that I feel like (77:12 - 77:17)
with a game it's (77:14 - 77:17)
more H what's like more obvious yeah (77:18 - 77:24)
maybe and like the you could obviously (77:22 - 77:26)
the booster pack were not provided by (77:24 - 77:28)
like the Pokemon right it's just (77:26 - 77:30)
somebody can buy a booster box and then (77:28 - 77:32)
just give out packs of cards or whatever (77:30 - 77:36)
um and the drink was like just the name (77:32 - 77:38)
of a Pokemon so I I don't know that (77:36 - 77:39)
there's like that much connection there (77:38 - 77:41)
like there would be with like a a bar (77:39 - 77:42)
that's heavily (77:41 - 77:44)
advertising it being like a Pokemon (77:42 - 77:47)
themed thing (77:44 - 77:50)
but I don't know the lines drawn there (77:47 - 77:53)
are tricky yeah (77:50 - 77:55)
absolutely it doesn't say in this (77:53 - 77:57)
interview when Don (77:55 - 78:01)
left been few years yeah but there's (77:57 - 78:03)
been other interview like like Hannah (78:01 - 78:06)
said there's been other interviews with (78:03 - 78:06)
Don he seems cool he seems like a cool (78:09 - 78:14)
guy yes I wonder I wonder why he left (78:11 - 78:16)
Pokemon probably just for something (78:14 - 78:19)
bigger it sounded like it was really (78:16 - 78:23)
stressful uh he left in May of (78:19 - 78:23)
2020 well his current LinkedIn profile (78:24 - 78:32)
like finally finally the hard-hitting (78:30 - 78:34)
news we can report who's working where (78:32 - 78:37)
on LinkedIn well this is what it says (78:34 - 78:39)
Don McGaw if that's how you pronounce (78:37 - 78:41)
his last name figuring out what to do (78:39 - 78:43)
all day I might be retired I might be in (78:41 - 78:46)
my super villain era only time will tell (78:43 - 78:49)
is his I feel like is that if you were a (78:46 - 78:53)
lawyer for Microsoft SL pookemon (78:49 - 78:57)
you're probably good (78:53 - 78:57)
like lawyers already make a pretty good (78:57 - 79:03)
amount especially ones that are working (79:01 - 79:05)
for Microsoft and the Pokemon company (79:03 - 79:07)
yeah yeah yeah abely I imagine if you (79:05 - 79:09)
were like a lawyer for like Apple or (79:07 - 79:12)
Google or any of those Tech Giants (79:09 - 79:13)
you're probably (79:12 - 79:17)
set or Disney like Disney lawyers are (79:13 - 79:20)
probably yes all of those all the those (79:17 - 79:22)
people who are like the chief legal (79:20 - 79:24)
officer or the general counsel of those (79:22 - 79:26)
companies (79:24 - 79:28)
they've as far as how much they're (79:26 - 79:31)
getting paid they're just fine what they (79:28 - 79:33)
do with their finances I don't know so I (79:31 - 79:35)
have no idea if they're fine in that way (79:33 - 79:38)
but yeah they're they're getting paid (79:35 - 79:40)
just fine from the (79:38 - 79:40)
company all right well I think that's (79:42 - 79:48)
our show thanks for making it to the (79:44 - 79:48)
end I look the it's it's lawyers speak (79:49 - 79:53)
I'm sorry if you thought there was going (79:52 - 79:57)
to be something more there (79:53 - 79:57)
if there's anything lawyers are very (79:58 - 80:02)
good at it's talking in a way to be like (79:59 - 80:04)
here's the shortest answer that you (80:02 - 80:06)
deserve to know we're not giving you (80:04 - 80:07)
anything (80:06 - 80:10)
more there was about one line to do with (80:07 - 80:12)
the headline that most people used when (80:10 - 80:16)
running when spreading that news (80:12 - 80:19)
MH yeah talking about shutting down fan (80:16 - 80:22)
projects there was one sentence maybe (80:19 - 80:24)
two one one (80:22 - 80:28)
sentence I who was I with (80:24 - 80:30)
recently that they were like oh man you (80:28 - 80:32)
got to go see creatures and like ask (80:30 - 80:34)
them questions and I was like oh because (80:32 - 80:35)
I did that in Japan and I was like yeah (80:34 - 80:37)
that was like really cool and I was like (80:35 - 80:40)
it wasn't as cool as you thought not (80:37 - 80:43)
because the office is weren't cool or (80:40 - 80:45)
but the the worst part of that whole (80:43 - 80:48)
experience was sharing that time with (80:45 - 80:51)
media so there was like 10 content (80:48 - 80:53)
creators I think myself included and (80:51 - 80:57)
then there was like 20 T5 media like IGN (80:53 - 81:00)
comicbook.com Spanish Outlets Brazilian (80:57 - 81:04)
Outlets Etc and the worst part (81:00 - 81:07)
was when it was question time like (81:04 - 81:10)
hearing their questions because they (81:07 - 81:13)
would ask questions in a way of like I (81:10 - 81:17)
see what headline you want to write like (81:13 - 81:20)
I totally understand like it might even (81:17 - 81:22)
be a basic question where like we all (81:20 - 81:23)
everyone here knows the answer to this (81:22 - 81:26)
question why you why you ask it but (81:23 - 81:28)
like they want they want to write a (81:26 - 81:31)
specific headline and they want that (81:28 - 81:34)
answer like oh this is what they said in (81:31 - 81:38)
person in front of me in Japan on 2023 (81:34 - 81:40)
whatever the date was when we went and (81:38 - 81:42)
that was like if (81:40 - 81:44)
you if I was to take that whole (81:42 - 81:46)
experience because we were there for I (81:44 - 81:48)
think we were there for like four hours (81:46 - 81:49)
four or five (81:48 - 81:52)
hours you could have easily cut like 2 (81:49 - 81:54)
and a half 3 hours of like media (81:52 - 81:55)
question (81:54 - 81:58)
and been like none of these are really (81:55 - 81:59)
that (81:58 - 82:01)
beneficial and I'm sure they all wrote (81:59 - 82:02)
headline I'm sure when that like I was (82:01 - 82:05)
so busy in Japan I didn't like flip over (82:02 - 82:06)
to ig I don't know why I'm picking on (82:05 - 82:08)
IGN I didn't like flip over to IGN to be (82:06 - 82:09)
like ah (82:08 - 82:12)
what what four questions did you ask and (82:09 - 82:14)
like how did you write these articles (82:12 - 82:18)
I'm sure they did (82:14 - 82:18)
but reading this headline of like (82:18 - 82:23)
Pokemon former Chief lawyer on shutting (82:20 - 82:26)
down fan games and like it was literally (82:23 - 82:30)
like one one question out of the 10 (82:26 - 82:34)
questions we skipped through mhm yeah I (82:30 - 82:36)
I think what's the what's great about (82:34 - 82:38)
like the situation you were in where (82:36 - 82:40)
they're asking these questions at the (82:38 - 82:44)
creatur's office like they also have a (82:40 - 82:46)
scripted answer for every single (82:44 - 82:48)
question that will probably be asked (82:46 - 82:50)
because if they don't have an answer (82:48 - 82:52)
they're not going to just do it off like (82:50 - 82:55)
on the fly so it's like you're getting (82:52 - 82:58)
these questions that the media knows (82:55 - 83:00)
they can get a headline out of but it's (82:58 - 83:02)
like and then on the other side it's (83:00 - 83:03)
like that's already been scripted in a (83:02 - 83:06)
way before they even ask the question of (83:03 - 83:07)
what that answer is going to be those (83:06 - 83:08)
they know that that's going to end up as (83:07 - 83:10)
a headline so they're going to structure (83:08 - 83:12)
their answer in a way that's only going (83:10 - 83:14)
to benefit them you know it's like it's (83:12 - 83:15)
all (83:14 - 83:19)
so scripted convoluted yeah and yeah and (83:15 - 83:21)
doesn't really get anywhere and (83:19 - 83:25)
sometimes like in that situation the (83:21 - 83:27)
the people we were like asking the (83:25 - 83:31)
questions to were not fluent in (83:27 - 83:33)
English and so the (83:31 - 83:36)
translators would in many (83:33 - 83:40)
cases hear our question and then (83:36 - 83:42)
translate it to them and then like (83:40 - 83:46)
slightly change the question to (83:42 - 83:47)
something way (83:46 - 83:50)
simpler and then we would get the answer (83:47 - 83:52)
back and it was like yeah you kind you (83:50 - 83:55)
you answered the question that like (83:52 - 83:57)
the translator gave you that wasn't the (83:55 - 84:01)
indepth question that we asked and I (83:57 - 84:03)
wasn't sure if they were like (84:01 - 84:05)
translating it away because they they (84:03 - 84:08)
wanted to get that scripted (84:05 - 84:11)
answer like oh let me simplify this (84:08 - 84:13)
question a little bit because I we we (84:11 - 84:14)
know you don't speak Japanese you don't (84:13 - 84:15)
know the way in which they were (84:14 - 84:19)
translating it no she she would repeat (84:15 - 84:21)
the question in English in a simpler (84:19 - 84:23)
form oh okay yeah oh that's weird that's (84:21 - 84:25)
interesting but exactly what they're (84:23 - 84:27)
going to do in order cuz yeah because (84:25 - 84:28)
they (84:27 - 84:30)
can't and there was two there was two (84:28 - 84:32)
translators and sometimes they would go (84:30 - 84:34)
back and (84:32 - 84:36)
forth so it'd be like this is just an (84:34 - 84:38)
example this question wasn't asked but (84:36 - 84:42)
it would be like um like how (84:38 - 84:46)
many Pokemon cards did you sell in 2022 (84:42 - 84:48)
again this question was not this is just (84:46 - 84:50)
so I would ask like how many Pokemon CS (84:48 - 84:52)
did you sell in 2022 and then the they (84:50 - 84:54)
would like talk about how they were (84:52 - 84:55)
going to translate it and then the they (84:54 - 84:59)
would say like uh do we sell a lot of (84:55 - 85:00)
cards in (84:59 - 85:02)
2022 and then they would ask that and (85:00 - 85:03)
then the answer would be like yes we (85:02 - 85:06)
sold a lot of cards but that wasn't the (85:03 - 85:07)
question I (85:06 - 85:10)
asked but that's exactly like that think (85:07 - 85:12)
about that don't take the translation (85:10 - 85:14)
out of it completely right um Apple for (85:12 - 85:17)
instance they no longer report how many (85:14 - 85:19)
uh like iPhones they sell in a quarter (85:17 - 85:22)
right so if someone asked Apple how many (85:19 - 85:25)
iPhones did you sell last quarter (85:22 - 85:26)
Apple's going to come back and say we (85:25 - 85:28)
sold a lot of iPhones last quarter (85:26 - 85:30)
they're not going to say we you know how (85:28 - 85:33)
many did we sell and so I'm sure those (85:30 - 85:36)
translators also know what information (85:33 - 85:39)
is actually going to be given to the (85:36 - 85:41)
media and things like that and so if the (85:39 - 85:42)
question were I know like it's an (85:41 - 85:43)
example but if the question were how (85:42 - 85:45)
many did you sell in 2022 how many (85:43 - 85:48)
Pokemon cards did you sell and they know (85:45 - 85:49)
oh we're not going to reveal that (85:48 - 85:51)
information but we can tell you that we (85:49 - 85:53)
sold a lot of Pokemon cards in 2022 (85:51 - 85:54)
they're going to ask it that way anyway (85:53 - 85:55)
way because that's going to be the (85:54 - 85:57)
answer that's going to come back so I (85:55 - 86:00)
just feel like the other (85:57 - 86:03)
thing cuz the the push back from hanah's (86:00 - 86:04)
really good because then I have to think (86:03 - 86:07)
about like how it was like (86:04 - 86:10)
worded the there were two questions and (86:07 - 86:11)
I can't exactly remember what they were (86:10 - 86:14)
I think one was money related of like oh (86:11 - 86:18)
did you make a lot of money and when (86:14 - 86:21)
those questions were asked you could see (86:18 - 86:23)
the person that only spoke Japanese like (86:21 - 86:24)
the person that was supposed to answer (86:23 - 86:26)
the question like waiting for the (86:24 - 86:28)
question and then the two translators (86:26 - 86:30)
would be like they would be the ones (86:28 - 86:33)
that say oh we're not answering that can (86:30 - 86:34)
you give us a different (86:33 - 86:37)
question yeah like they they like they (86:34 - 86:40)
didn't even entertain the fact that like (86:37 - 86:42)
we're GNA pass this question on to the (86:40 - 86:45)
like yeah the head honcho they were the (86:42 - 86:47)
ones that were like they definitely knew (86:45 - 86:49)
like oh he he can't answer that and (86:47 - 86:51)
we're not going to even like give him a (86:49 - 86:53)
simplified version of this question that (86:51 - 86:55)
you just asked a lot of media training (86:53 - 86:57)
and a lot more control than I would have (86:55 - 87:00)
expected but I guess that works that's (86:57 - 87:02)
I'm still shocked they were like do you (87:00 - 87:03)
want to visit creatures (87:02 - 87:06)
offices (87:03 - 87:06)
like that is like (87:07 - 87:11)
[Music] (87:09 - 87:14)
so guarded (87:11 - 87:17)
mhm like even (87:14 - 87:21)
even I don't even I I kind of feel like (87:17 - 87:23)
they like put bags over our head and was (87:21 - 87:24)
like this is like I don't even know how (87:23 - 87:28)
I got in that place like I couldn't (87:24 - 87:29)
didn't you film it like there were (87:28 - 87:31)
stairs there was a vending machine I saw (87:29 - 87:33)
that could you could only film on (87:31 - 87:37)
certain floors okay but like the there (87:33 - 87:40)
is no signage outside the building to (87:37 - 87:42)
say it's creatures it's in like a shared (87:40 - 87:45)
business building with other buildings (87:42 - 87:48)
MH so unless I don't know if you maybe (87:45 - 87:49)
you could just go Google Map and type in (87:48 - 87:51)
creatures and be like oh there it is but (87:49 - 87:53)
even if you got there you'd have like no (87:51 - 87:56)
way to know if you were actually there (87:53 - 87:58)
or (87:56 - 88:00)
not but I feel like they like made you (87:58 - 88:02)
also leave out of a different door than (88:00 - 88:04)
you came in so you're even more confused (88:02 - 88:06)
as to you had to leave with a ticket you (88:04 - 88:08)
came in you know how like you scan like (88:06 - 88:10)
a ticket to like get onto a train and (88:08 - 88:13)
the the doors open like you couldn't get (88:10 - 88:15)
out without scanning the same ticket you (88:13 - 88:18)
got into oh wow yeah I've been in a (88:15 - 88:20)
building that was like that like they (88:18 - 88:24)
wanted to make sure like you were gone (88:20 - 88:25)
like (88:24 - 88:28)
like they were very like do not lose (88:25 - 88:30)
this ticket because you need it to leave (88:28 - 88:33)
like they need to know that you are out (88:30 - 88:34)
of this building I wonder what would (88:33 - 88:36)
have happened if you lost the ticket you (88:34 - 88:38)
now work for creatures you cannot leave (88:36 - 88:40)
the (88:38 - 88:40)
building (88:41 - 88:46)
um all right well that's today's episode (88:43 - 88:47)
uh we'll be back next week we'll give (88:46 - 88:49)

raicho (88:49 - 88:53)

say we're probably not get anything Za (88:53 - 88:58)
related anytime (88:55 - 88:58)
soon I feel like the closest would maybe (88:59 - 89:04)
be worlds we would get (89:02 - 89:07)
that maybe a little bit speaking worlds (89:04 - 89:10)
we don't have dates for worlds yet okay (89:07 - 89:11)
I feel like we would get something in (89:10 - 89:16)
like June possibly worlds is presumably (89:11 - 89:19)
in August yeah but I feel like we' get (89:16 - 89:21)
something in like the beginning of (89:19 - 89:24)
Summer from Pokemon I don't like I don't (89:21 - 89:27)
know like I I don't think this game is (89:24 - 89:32)
like January February March oh jeez this (89:27 - 89:35)
conversation I do think this game is q1 (89:32 - 89:39)
of 2025 but that is uh yeah just because (89:35 - 89:42)
of how they did the last Legends game we (89:39 - 89:44)
have no we have no other information (89:42 - 89:47)
yeah just a potential (89:44 - 89:50)
pattern but even when they announc the (89:47 - 89:53)
one Legends the one Legends the other (89:50 - 89:55)
