what's up everyone welcome to the two hundred and thirtieth episode of the Pokemon podcast I'm your host SBJ it is super effective I sometimes forget to say that to my left I have Logan hey long time since I've been on this podcast you're back I'm back you're here better than ever now that concealed trap says Joe can say that I'm in my little inform my neck got so long it's weird I was just gonna say that this is travis in as a low inform it's just look Logan form i also have will with us today and myelin form is poisoned steel that's the only change everything else looks exactly the same opposed to what what were you before now you're asking the tough questions ice fairy all right how's about that ice fairy ok alright icse we got a show for you guys today we have some pokemon go news we have some Pokemon world championship results and we also have an interview later on in the show i interviewed ophidian who is a wrestler from jakarta Jakara takara there we go i don't know why i say it wrong but it's true Cara that is right that is a wrestling promotion like TNA like WWE like ROH just a different wrestling promotion now before you turn off the episode before you go I don't wanna listen to a wrestler ophidian is a huge pokémon player and so we talked Pokemon we talked some video game we talked a little bit about just wrestling and how how that works more so net like what's it like to be a wrestler it's more so how do you fit video games in while always being on the road that kind of thing mmm and is his name Ophidian because he likes set trading card game that I play no but his his oh well maybe I don't know his character gimmick is he is a snake from Egypt I'm I'm not doing its service he will he will obviously explain that during the part of that part of the interview and so we're going to talk about news get some thoughts from Logan on what we have had from Sun and Moon the best thoughts the best thoughts then we'll do the interview with ophidian and then when we come back then we'll wrap up with Pokemon of the week so that's the show for you guys today before we get to that though because we have to of course first steer way off topic then come back otherwise this whole show falls apart but what's new what's good Logan it's been a while since you've been on how have you been yeah I've been really great you know been playing pokemon go until I didn't so much anymore but eagerly awaiting for that to get good again of course I'm I'm getting ahead of myself talk about Pokemon related things I was on the Tuesday night podcast just now we recorded that awesome dungeons and dragon i'ts mini campaign at gencon which I'm really excited about everybody listening to that's and I've been working a lot playing a bunch of a games and stuff finished undertale that was super fun we sort of had our undertale discussion not on the podcast so you really liked it this I did I really liked it a lot like tomorrow more than spj did tell you that I mean I did play all of it and then watched all the alternative stuff some away I'm well versed in the undernet the tales of the tales I don't know I just love love sans that characters great actually all the characters are great and I laughed out loud a lot playing that game and I probably haven't laughed out loud or I haven't left out loud that much at a piece of media in a really long time I can't remember the last time that I've experienced like a anything a book of podcast well I guess the adventure zone is made me laugh out loud quite a bit but um is that you laugh pretty hard during our dungeons and dragon night sessions that's very true but that's like I don't know that feels like a totally separate realm because it's like us it's like real people you know it's not really a it doesn't count as a media thing if I'm currently doing it with all the people live right isn't yeah you're all fake people here yeah when you when you listen to the event his own it's nothing but fake people I you know what I mean I mean like I was in a room what up yeah dying okay but you guys are fake people that's Ritter yes that's true no one's arguing with that well how have you been I am so stressed out right now because you're making this so difficult because like Logan said we literally recorded tuesday night podcast like 15 minutes ago and so this could kind of be like part two of that except that this is going to come out before that so yeah I don't know how to transcend time and space to speak like I haven't spoken already but I will say this and this is the most important thing I this is almost like my 20th year working Georgetown University new student move in New Student Orientation had my 3ds out on the table in front of me for I think a sum total of eighteen hours and received zero street passes what is wrong with Georgetown University that nobody has a 3ds why why do I work this is literally the antithesis of any universe that I should be and I need to work at the University where everybody has a 3ds tell me where that university is I will apply for a job there i will work there these Georgetown kids are so like dude they don't ya feelin all really in there isn't Georgetown like one of the big top ten colleges I maybe I'm completely off I don't at top 25 toc 25 top 25 okay in a specific subject matter we might be in first place but in general college pneus top 25 hmm that's like I feel like if you're going to georgetown you're probably bragging that you're going to georgetown well i mean that's what I do yes I did go to die I'm Georgetown graduate so congrats will anderson and i did go to the best school at Georgetown the School of Foreign Service so double congrats Will Anderson but it's just like I I don't I can't relate to these kids they if they I literally posted on to it I'm like if you're coming to Georgetown's new Student Orientation hit me up at the U is table in red square and we can have a pokemon battle and nobody came to have a pokemon battle do you all do you think the the 3ds has like kind of scene it's light on its way out I feel the 3ds yeah I believe we just had a discussion about how the 3ds has doubled sales since july of last year or anything like that you're right you're right but it's still sort of in its and it's like last phases it just has sort of like a rebirth because uh them do monster hunter came out and everybody's psyched about Pokemon yeah I mean what else to say for I just want to be very clear about all the people who are talking about how Nintendo is a dying business or whatever how like Japan specifically used Nintendo concepts and imagery for their announcement for the tokyo olympics yeah because such an irrelevant and going out of business company i love about i'm not saying that like the 3ds is doomed or or its out the window i'm just saying the hardware itself is a bit old and with no the rumor saying and the concepts of the NX coming out and possibly it being like a portable / that would spark more people to carry their devices around I don't go out anymore with my 3ds I used to take it everywhere to and from work and now my 3ds cat assets on my coffee table and like when I go to a convention i bring my 3ds well all I can say to you is be a part of the solution not be a part of the problem I love three days I'm not saying I don't I'm just saying that it's it's the hardware's a little old I need puzzle pieces I need like 200 puzzle pieces all complete at all no I know you do because you never have your 3ds with you see you never get puzzle pieces I i would probably suffer the same issues you're suffering from right now and not a lot of people are straight passing me so then I just stopped ringing the 3ds because if I wasn't getting straight passes what's the point it just it just makes me cry Georgetown students you're 18 years old you're not a lawyer yet you're allowed to have some fun break out some video games and have a good time I'm worrying about like the future it's your first day at a university you're allowed to play some pokemons you know maybe their stress how are you stressed on the first day of you'd like you haven't even started school yet it's like it's like a party for you it's like hooray you're at Georgetown party Marty out of the time I don't know you can be stressed on Wednesday the first day of classes oh um ophidian means a snake or relating to snakes so now I've learned something character as a snake good call back let's jump let's jump into some news and then we can go off the rails again here I guess I didn't talk about me but that's all right how are you Steve what you've been up to what's up man good actually I'm preparing for pax this is Pokemon podcast related but I am preparing to go to pax pax is not this weekend but the if you're listening to this on Monday or Tuesday or whenever whenever as soon as you listen to it packs will be that coming weekend the weekend the first week of September will be that friday saturday sunday monday i will be there I will araya there saturday sunday monday on monday specifically i will be speaking about pokemon in the hydra theater at 1030am labor day i was told that the room can hold 600 people you should come out if you can get a ticket to pax i know they're sold out but sometimes they sell day of so again monday i'll be there i'll be giving away Pokemon go pins for the people who you know stop by and say hi to me after after the panel so yeah I'm really nervous for that because i'm a i'm a very nervous flyer and I've never been to Seattle or that area so that's kind of all new to me and everything but I am excited for that other than that I've been playing a lot of monster huntin hunter at night so not a lot like an hour or so if if people are in the slack and they're willing to hunt we have a a lot we've had an increase of people buying monster hunter and in slack and going this is my first monster hunter and so I'm just trying to make time to make sure that they enjoy monster hunter because that is a real intimidating game yeah it's real intimidating but it's real fun I killed two great Macau simultaneously this morning and I know it's just a village quest huh so it's the most wonderful feeling like every time I literate I mean I keep saying this but it's so true I literally do not get out of bed in the morning until I've killed something and it's like I've already done my greatest accomplishment of the day and i'm still in bed yeah it's great i like to kill something before i go to bed yeah that's my that's my jam um that's what I saved my gather quests chill you know get me some mushrooms go to bed I like to go to bed knowing that I've not only killed a creature but I've skinned it and I am now wearing it for the next day haha but that time we killed like six ghormeh galas oh yeah that was good i need to kill more Igor's by the way I'm I'm like three Gore short of a set i'm down to hunt definitely yeah let's do it speaking of down to hunting 10 million people are no longer down to play pokemon go that was really good you should have been like down to hunt pokemon yeah I should've I didn't want to say the word hunt a lot but yeah this article this article's been everywhere this you know 11 new site reports they all report it here Ars Technica is where I've looked here Pokemon go loses luster sheds more than 10 million users engagement downloads and time spent in the app are fading fast now I will say that's a large drop in user base is very standard for almost any app so I I do think that a lot of news outlets are running with this in a way that is a little bit more hyperbolic than and perhaps it should be because like every app experience is like a 20-percent dip and users after its initially released yeah and and if you're if you're a new listener too it's super effective we I think without a doubt we all loved and enjoyed our time with Pokemon go we might not be playing it every week or every day I mean I'm definitely gonna be playing it when I'm in Seattle because I want to see what their Pokemon look like us and especially because its convention I'm so there are so many lures and everything that are being placed around but but my point was we have been very hard on Pokemon go but we've also been very positive on Pokemon go so I don't know how this again turned out I don't know if this is gonna be as complaining or us being like nah put mine goes so good I'll read the article first it has been almost it had almost 45 million daily users in July but figures appear to have been sunk by almost 12 million since the start of August to just over 30 million people now playing pokemon go further decline is expected as downloads engagements and time spent using the app have visibly flopped according to data provided by census sensor tower survey monkey and app topia bloomberg which saw the raw data reported that the other majority apps such as Twitter Facebook and snapchat can breathe a sigh of relief that Pokemon go was finally wobbling as the game's popularity has a bit has apparently been costing them considerable amounts of users given the rapid rise in usage of Pokemon goes apps since the launch in July investors have been concerned that this new user experience has been distracting by time spent on other mobile-focused apps that some analysts from some capital management place developer niantic is preserving the game however is do with a release version for Android and iOS there's a new patch coming out that we're going to talk about next niantic also hinted at upcoming developments and designs to improve the games questionable long tivity they stated this is knee antic quote we are working hard on several new and exciting features come to come in the future of Pokemon go and quote very generic quote I'll give them that but we'll talk about the update here in a second let's talk about this news though Logan you already mentioned that a lot of apps see a decline after the first week or so yeah I think Pokemon go surprised all of us not only from how it blew out of the gate at such a enormous speed of getting new users on but I was more so impressive how those users stayed on for weeks and now we're we're are almost in two months three of this game yeah I mean honestly like I said like the dip that's a very standard percentage dip for you know when a game is very hype brought to the next month or whatever but normally that that occurs over like a week or two you have like a maximum user base and then it trails off quickly the Pokemon had a pretty long pretty long tail for the Hat I mean I I'm still impressed with it and I don't know most of these articles aren't presenting you with like similar statistics for other apps like clash royale or whatever you know like well I think that was probably a very similar trajectory and I don't necessarily think that that means it's suddenly not a success or not making the money you know I yeah I want to see I want to see the comparison to candy crush like right now what's the what's the curve on people dropping off on that or still playing or anything like that we'll use you said that you were around for new student orientation where did you notice Pokemon go players or no did I mention how disappointed I am in Georgetown students no pokemon go players no you didn't see a single phone with Pokemon go on it as you were standing outside other than my own no all right and George and George Sheldon the campus is full of polka stops oh I believe it even some of my co-workers were complaint yeah some of my co-workers were complaining that some of the pokey stops on campus we've changed the names of some of the buildings but the pokey stops are still named the old name of the buildings so I had to explain to them why that is but like it's mostly my co-workers and none of the I did not see any suits then again like all the students like their parents were standing over their shoulders the entire time so the thinking like we paid a lot of money for you to go to this school you best not be playing pokemon exactly you know you know it's funny is um we had free handouts on our table and like all these parents were like like little cell phone pad things and everything and they're like oh can we take this and I literally said to every parent that said that your tuition money paid for that take as many as you ha but yeah they were i guess i will step back a little from criticizing georgetown students that parents are little intense over this weekend and maybe things will chill out a little bit more there is a Pokemon gym at the location the building where our technology service desk is and I know that that has changed over between teams a few times so that there's that level of activity and it's just we're kind of in a weird location in DC where there's not as many people as maybe downtown or where the monuments are so I don't know I there's always going to be plenty of Pokemon go in DC just because of the number of people who travel through here and like just like you when they travel here they're going to want to play pokemon go just because DC is different and especially because we have all the monuments where there will be pokey stops and gyms and things that are worth actually playing against hmm totally totally well there is a new update for Pokemon go this came out I had probably four or five days ago it's a new patch that introduces Pokemon appraisal for Android that's going to be 0.3 5.0 and for iOS that's going to be 1.50 Pokemon appraisal allows players that are on a team that's the important note you have to be on valor mystic or instinct to get appropriate evaluations of their Pokemon IVs similar to stat judge in the core series game pokemon appraisals can be accessed on the menu button Pokemon appraisals is done by that players gym leader specific wording just like the game like all this pokémons excellent this pokémons good this pokémons okay this pokémons terrible i'm just generalizing but i believe there are four levels if the Pokemon has a height or weight that differs significantly from the average that will also be commented additionally Pokemon that are ejected from a gym now return fainted instead of at one HP this has been applied server side so it will occur regardless whether or not the patch has been downloaded how do you guys feel about the appraisal feature that that that's added somebody needs to explain to me does the appraisal feature mean that the Pokemon you catch besides the CP that they have that they have IVs that are hidden is that what it's telling yes I know that okay it pretty much comes down to there are your Pokemon falls into excellent great good or bad and the the amount of Stardust's you give to it if it's like if it's great you would want excellent because your Stardust going into an excellent is just worth it more like that Pokemon will hit a higher CP level at the end of the day I'm trying to like break that down to really like simplest yeah it's hard for me since I still haven't joined a team and I can't battle gyms and stuff the whole battling and any part of that has is a mystery to me well so there's three the beyond CP CP is comprised of like your average of the three attributes which are attack HP and oh man the other one defense oh wait I already said that no no you defense yeah that was the last one okay cool alright well and so it's not like regular pokemon where you have to yep you want to get maximum zon six different stats it's much easier to find a perfect oh c'mon but you I can you do you were researching that earlier will like can you still get appraisals if you're not on a team no you can't i cannot get an appraisal you have to talk to your your judge okay your leader well you should join a team what's stopping you ah the acrimony that existed between all the teams at the beginning I I will no no no no multi-party let me ask a different question is this what you would have wanted in an update no I can't believe they spent so much time on this thing that like the the footsteps still are very broken I don't understand why they're not just fixing the pizza well for me all I want it all I want is to track down Pokemon that's the whole thing and for me personally I think the gym system is really weak not a very good combat system it's way easier to take down a gym than it is to train at a gym which doesn't make any sense at all and any gym near me if you take if a team takes it over you can just watch it fall and be rebuilt as a different team every 30 minutes there's nothing nothing stays put so there's no the the resources you have to pour into doing that is not worth it yeah I do I don't so I saw the update and I went okay that is silly great I I can't so if I'm if I'm in somebody's footsteps somebody shoes not their footsteps I'm thinking footsteps because of the foot steps that were taken away yeah if I'm in somebody's shoes and my main appeal my favorite thing about Pokemon go is the battling like am i still even excited that there is now this hidden IV system to say that my Pokemon fits into the one of these four categories and great this Pokemon is excellent and now I train them up and then I sent him to a gym and then in a day that that pokemon comes back to me fainted because Jim's don't last that long ray it how it I would love to talk to somebody where they go like this is the best thing ever because i think the battling system in the gym see a system like you said is the weakest part of the game and adding i like saying that this pokemon this Charizard that you have is slightly better than this Charizard ok cool it doesn't matter either Charizard i put in there is going to come back to me tomorrow right that's exactly my point like there's where in competitive Pokemon like the games for 3ds those those like getting a 31 instead of a 30 in your IV really matters it really it could agree the difference between surviving an attack or not but it's it's a matter of if they're gonna stay in that gym for thirty minutes or 32 minutes no it's just not so i will say the one thing is if you're having a hard time deciding which of your pokemon to be the one that you keep if you're turning all the rest of them into candies I mean it helps you somewhat make that selection yeah I will and that's that's fair but I feel like the CP system sort of does that for you in a general sense like I you can definitely tell oh this Magikarp is 10 CP and this Magikarp is a hundred and twenty so I'll keep 120 IA but you're right you you can if you if you're having trouble distinguishing which one is actually going to be the best one long term than yeah go for it but for me I am waiting until gems make any sense to put any resources into before I even spend the one of those even called not candy but the arbiters sir artist I haven't I haven't spent any Stardust since like day three I was going to say the last time I spent Stardust was like day two because I wanted to report on what it did right yeah and then you're just saving it up for I don't know what yeah cuz I'm in a position where I have no interest in taking over a gym because I know that it will just get taken back so if there is a gym I'll leave a Pokemon there and then collect my ten gold and then tomorrow I'll see that like that Pokemon is no longer at the gym and that's okay like that's cool but I don't know like that that the battling is not interesting to me and i don't i don't see the benefit of the ice IV system because like what you said it what you and I both said is it doesn't but your pokemons going to get objective for that gym no matter what right because the PE defending is always at the disadvantage from attacking but more people asking for this I feel like everyone was just they want footprints and I'm cool right now without the footprints because I play so casually I like when I go to the post office I know others polka stop there I when I go to this store another's focused up there so i will always open my phone before i go into the building get my get my rewards when I come out of the building get my rewards go on my day maybe catch it if there's a Pidgey there because there's a Pidgey everywhere but if I was if I was back to spending three or four hours hunting Pokemon the footsteps would be priority number one but if I'm walking around a convention where there's thousands of stops and everything really my priority number one is making sure I hit all those a thousand stops to stock up on stuff so when I go hunting pokemon i have that exactly I know that none of that was battles this may just be preparation for person on person battling which you know they'll release later so they get you used to the rating system and then person on person battling this will matter more yeah I guess but where was a little bit what's the benefit there but why get them i select the right Pokemon too yeah and i should i should say like there's no benefit of battling your friends in the main series game but the battling system is not for extending the bots of the bonds of friendship yes your Pokemon battles but but the battling system in Pokemon go is just not good so why would I want to do that against friend the current battling system is not good we don't know what the person on person battling system is going to look like who can tap faster I don't know I'm just I'm just joking now but I have one more Pokemon go article this was actually Milwaukee related and so kind of hit home at me hit home with me here I cannot talk but I've talked about this place before Lake Park spent several hours there it was when I saw like the 400 people chased the dragon air or the Dragon Knight I camera can remember i think was dragging it anyways you guys remember that story yeah if you haven't it was like six six or seven episodes ago so this is a letter from the Milwaukee County Park System Tunis antic addressed to the CEO something hanky I can't remember his first name I'm gonna read the letter here real quick so again this is for Milwaukee County Parks dear mr. Hankey the Pokemon go phenom phenomenon there we go there we go i said it right the book mango phenomenom it is on full display at milwaukee county parks most notably at its beloved and historic Lake Park National Register of Historic Places number 9 3000 339 indeed this park is a national treasure designed by the renowned Frederick Law Olmsted who once described the park work as a democratic development of the highest significance Lake Park has quickly become known as one of the most active Pokemon go areas in the Midwest I don't know if that's true but anyways the Pokemon go phenomenon has introduced hundreds if not thousands of individuals to our park system and doubtless has resulted in many new positive recreational experiences the Milwaukee County Park System recreation and cultural development applause those outcomes however there have been other unanticipated and negative consequences from Pokemon related activities which have caused significant disruption both within Lake Park and in adjacent neighborhoods these include daily traffic congestion parking issues littering compacted and damaged turf risk too sensitive flora and fauna furama habitat wanna Jana habitats and non-compliance with park system operational hours this letter is provided to notify you of milwaukee County's parks policy related to virtual geocaches and require you immediate we comply with that policy which includes prior written permission before placement of virtual geocaching in milwaukee county park niantic inc must complete a separate notification placement form for each intended Pokemon go site within the walkie county park system that link can be found here and sent to this address hmm the parks geo get geocaching guidelines link is attached here for your convenience as noted should I antic Inc be granted permission to place Pokemon go sites within any Milwaukee County County Park it will there after be responsibility for regularly monitoring each cash four times per year is recommended and reporting vandalism and debt reiation of property wow so that letter was sent in the antic that was monday that was that was right after 229 came out that letter came out i feel like there's like there's like two possibilities it's either nothing happens with that or knee antic stops supporting those polka stops like they just cut them off yes and that's it I was just gonna say this sounds like such a load of hooey you can't make a law about virtual geocaches that is like the most ridiculous over-reaching non sufficiently specific like what if like a fourth grader does a little map in their free time in their class of Lake Park and they're like oh this is where my imaginary dragons can be found and then like the city of Milwaukee's gonna come crashing you can't have a virtual geocache on your little piece of paper you fourth grader you didn't apply a separate permit for each one and check it four times a year you let a bunch of bunk I will say okay so i have i have milwaukee County's geocaching permit pulled up here i'll talk about that in a second so i saw the post on Reddit and our / milwaukee and then of course people who then i mean this this made it also to the front page I think of are such Pokemon go and so I got some tweets I got some texts about this I said I I saw it thank you for letting me know I plan on talking about it on it's super effective and then later in the day just because I was following it I saw an interview with the gentleman who wrote this the guy in charge of Milwaukee County Parks and the first thing the interviewer asked that guy was do you think knee antics going to respond and he paused roll along then laughed and said I hope so okay she's really good it was really good so uh County Milwaukee gov / I don't know geocaching yep actually it is / geocaching I find that this just kind of punts lays out something find a cache in Milwaukee County Parks geocaching is a popular outdoor scavenger hunt that uses global positioning system aka GPS device and Internet published coordinates to locate virtual or physical cash a virtual cash maybe it may be an amazing view a physical cash maybe a trinket or a log or a book or container hidden under some leaves geocaching is an acceptable activity in parks when following the these guidelines now these are Milwaukee's rules I believe every county state is different types of geocaching allowed in the parts parks virtual preferred method it says in parentheses preferred method coordinates of stationary landmark guides participants to the virtual cache virtual caches are verified by only emailed photos of the cache site physical geocaching participants seek a hidden not buried physical cash a waterproof container storing trade items logbooks for letterbox cash there's usually the logbooks rubber stamps participants may use their own physical log books or their own personal stamps for a micro cash use a smaller container like a film canister to be used based guidelines for geocaching for all participants you must abide by Milwaukee cordie county ordinance you must confirm to leave no trace of outdoor ethic guidelines take nothing but photo pairs leave nothing but footprints for more information of the Leave No Trace principle go here if you discover any illegal or hazardous materials in your cash you must contact Milwaukee County Parks and immediately blah blah blah so that's pretty much it so really the the the whole point to the letter that I understood was knee antic we're cool with this but you need to fill out our form but we know you're not going to so remove these that's like the feeling I got from it that's that's a guy think that's gonna happen and I is that actually what they want do you think you know how to remove the focus on well here's the thing and I don't know if I've ever said this about like Park the lake park looks over Lake Michigan and so below lake park because it is up pretty high and there's like the steep hill that goes down so below lake park is Bradford beach and and lake drive which is just one of the main roads to like get to all these downtown attractions behind lake park if you're if you're looking like Michigan Bradford beach road lake park behind lake park is probably one of the richest neighborhoods in all of Milwaukee ah there you go like no I'm not exaggerating like four million dollar plus houses all along lake park so that Milwaukee which is like a 10 million dollar house anyplace else right yeah 2m that neighborhood he touches like park so lake park is is pretty long it's probably 23 miles long so if you start at one end and Pokemon go and walk to the other end that's probably going to take you in maybe 20 minutes and then you turn around and walk back I have to admit imagine that this is because of that neighborhood for all those people parking on the street for the congestion that it builds because there is there is a parking lot on one side of Lake Park that every time I went to Lake Park was just full and so there's street parking and street parkings you not allow for everyone but that is also filled their the other rumor I heard was there's only one bathroom at Lake Park and it's below a restaurant that also shares with that parking lot it is a public bathroom anyone can use it but it I think it locks at 10 and so since that is the only bathroom for a consistent amount of people just going through with Lake Park that bathroom gets extremely dirty extremely fast II and and if you heard my Pokemon go specials or just normal episodes of its perfective I have talked about you know the police clearing ever would have that 10 because technically technically the park closes at ten and people were prior to that playing very light into the night so I'll just say number one I am a huge believer in the Leave No Trace principle and I think anybody who is enjoying our country's natural resources should familiarize themselves with the tenants of Leave No Trace before entering a national park or any nature preserve area I will make that very clear uh but second I will also say I am a very big fan of something called evidence and I don't think especially governmental bodies should be making claims that any kind of particular damage or occurrence is happening because of a particular well Pokemon go or any other type of thing unless they have evidence showing that each and every person who has damaged a particular location was a Pokemon go player maybe the park is just exceptionally popular this year because a lot of nature lovers have moved to Milwaukee you haven't given me evidence one way or the other you just know that coincidentally and coincidence is not allowable in a court of law Pokemon go has come out at the same time that your reported damage to Milwaukee Parks has occurred now steve has never taken me to lake park because Steve really doesn't like me as a friend but I suspect with my knowledge of Milwaukee first off that park that's over there by the river is going to be much nicer than Lake Park and it's it's it's a public park so yeah so lake park is near beach lake park is also in your marquette which is a very popular university it's also that's party school if I ever heard it it's also another Jesuit University of our country it's also near UWM which is next to the east side which is very close to Lake Park so the the amount of people that go to Lake Park for what you get at Lake Park pocus stop / walking distances Lake Park is the place to go no one's debating that so I get that as popular you they want to fix that you know the simple system the simple way to do it is just remove a couple polka stops there's points in Lake Park where there are four poka poka stops touching each other and people sit there because they don't walk they just hit all four every five minutes absolutely not do not give in to this bullying I'm just saying the park for all kinds of reasons because I like to drink a beer and watch the sunset over the lake even though it's probably facing in the wrong direction I like to drink a beer and watch the sunrise over the lake that's why I go to the park do you know it can you have a beer departmental play I if you cover it in a brown paper bag don't have anything just saying that like if you want to just you know maybe bring down foot traffic traffic you could remove a couple stops but this is going to be a situation where it's all or nothing they're either going to keep all these stops or they're going to remove them all and removing them all is probably the worst option especially because Pokemon go will die down just like everything else does and what happens when it gets super cold out what happened ones one winter comes now this is no longer a problem oh and also yet milwaukee public parks don't come crying to me when you can't get donations and funding for your parts because you can't prove that anybody goes there after you chased everybody away by taking away their polka stops yeah and i'll just say if i sound extra bitter it's because about 14 years ago there was this huge beautiful three day outdoor concert festival like of the european style was one of the first ones that was ever going to happen in the United States there's going to be all the way out on the tip of Long Island man I spent like two hundred dollars on the tickets for that I was going to get a tent camp out everything it was going to be beautiful but you know my morning jacket was going to play all kinds of great bands and everything and they had to cancel the whole thing why because rich person on the end of Long Island said there's a rare bird that nests here and if you have your concert here those rare birds are all going to die and that was a load of baloney so you're just like scratching that itch right there no there's not protecting the natural what natural wildlife of Milwaukee the harley-davidson plant is that your your great preserve because I'll tell you something Michigan's doing a much better job of preserving wildlife with their incredibly boring state than you are Milwaukee I'm not saying Milwaukee's great I'm just giving I'm just giving you the news I'm so angry speaking of news I'll keep you guys updated on the Milwaukee outcome of this I don't know if how soon that will be but speaking of news what we'll do is we'll take a quick break when we come back I want to talk about worlds and the results there and yeah so we'll take a quick break when we come back we'll be talking about some worlds you I and we are back from our break do talk to you about worlds worlds 2016 so I think there was a bit of misunderstanding last week and wanted it I normally don't bring up negative reviews that we have well I have in the past but I wanted to touch on iTunes review here not because it was recent and it was specifically of our last episode before I before I read it or talk about it I do want to say that if you enjoy it's super effective it's something you listen to and you haven't done so already I would highly encourage you to take the time and leave us a review on iTunes even if you don't use itunes itunes is used by most of our listeners and we're trying to get to 700 reviews by the end of the year we're at 625 now so you have like five seconds in your day you can either use your computer with itunes on there or if you have an iOS device the podcast app will take you there itunes store or whatever would really really appreciate it because it's free doesn't cost anything and it really helps us out so moist moose left us a review and I I got a first off amazing name yeah super amazing name I want to say that he left us a one-star review and I want to start off saying I appreciate that he took the time and left a reason why he left us one sure review so I wanted to just comment on that and then that'll bring us into our worlds talk because most of it was he or she being upset that we didn't talk about worlds well enough so i'm just going to paraphrase it real quick titled a good podcast ruined by fanboying biased and poor research skills this podcast has a lot of good points but is ruined by the host research fanboying to the point and forgiving every bad mood yet bad move me antic has made and a hundred percent misreporting the state of the 2017 worlds what typing news 2016 but okay because they didn't bother to watch it here are some bullet points compared antic for banning a player for doing well in Pikeville and time gating them and comparing it to weekly resets and MMORPGs to when reporting on the 2016 VGC world they said they didn't feel like watching it because it will just be groudon exert eous flash the big six truth is that the core teams that made in stop forward didn't have the big six they it just kind of goes on of what the teams were so the the points I want to make is I thought we were clear and said that we were recording that before the finals so even though the podcast came out after world's ended we didn't know what the final matches were because we recorded it that Sunday morning and I do want to say that I watch every single finals and I've watched them all since 2011 so I definitely care about the finals and worlds i will say that I've missed a couple Nationals but I think world is just a bigger deal is more fun to watch but I did watch i watch the opening ceremonies I watched three hours of it after the opening ceremonies I did turn it on saturday watched it for about an hour I'm not going to say that you're wrong I totally didn't feel like watching it there I love a lot of things Pokemon is one of them watching competitive Pokemon all weekend not a love I like it not a love the other thing is we are pretty forgiving of knee antic i think but we are also pretty hard on the antic some episodes are up and some episodes are down but the end of the day it's a free-to-play game so it's hard to hold them to a certain standard when the initial by was zero dollars but I mean I feel like we were we were pretty hard on them today yeah talked about him earlier I think ya think so too I don't play pokemon go that much anymore but like I said I'm going to pee it go into PX going to pax and i PX and i am very excited to place a pokemon go there yeah I think that I think that was the big miss maybe we should made that more clear that we didn't wash the finals prior to recording even though the podcast came out after world was done which was just poor timing but we record every Sunday morning when we were recording you know finals didn't even start for anything I don't think hmm appreciate the review they said they plan on listening to the next episode to see if we addressed his concerns hopefully we did as for being unbiased I mean this is just a podcast of our opinions all this is we all have opinions we all like stuff we all don't like stuff but if you're looking if I and I've said this before I've said this a hundred times if you are looking for competitive information this is not the show for you there are so many awesome youtubers that do that better and I would encourage you to sneak those out if you're looking for competitive stuff if you're looking for soylent information I can really do that the new Soylent bars that came out this is small transition and a healthy living they're very similar to power bars but they taste better they have like the little crisp to them and I like that a lot like a kit kat crisps or rice krispies Chris but not all Chris just a bit of cream what about the new soiling coffee 'used coffee 'used ah I don't like it you know and I don't you not drink coffee that's the thing is I don't drink by a coffee so my friend Alex who only drinks by coffee he said he loved it and I gave it to my friend Tim who he said he only drinks black coffee and tim was super funny because he was very against Soylent he didn't know what it was I was like Ali you know it's def da approves made in the lab you should drink it so I gave him a coffee us cuz he says he drinks black coffee and he told me that he liked it a lot and he was about to order a box and I said hey I got half a box you wanna buy the rest of it don't you keep saying black coffee is it literary black coffee or is it doesn't have like a milk coffee kind of taste to it I don't know if you hit it to me it just tastes like thick black coffee not like super thick I would say like thick like milk like vitamin B or a milk is there a is that right vitamin B now all fortified with vitamin A so there's whole milk no something a little Oh milk two percent one presented live in wisco two per second ABC and D i would so skin is the thinnest milk hole is the thickest milk I would say that Soylent is closer to whole milk and i would say that coffee asst is closer to two percent milk in thickness coffee asst is apparently half coffee half Soylent I don't taste any silent I just taste all black coffee and from what I've read online and from talking to him and alex and another person that only drinks by coffee they loved it and so it's just me I just don't like by coffee and I've tried to like buy coffee and I maybe one day I'll get there but I could drink it I just didn't care I would rat when I was drinking coffee as I was thinking I could just be drinking Soylent because I like so I went better mmm but if you like black coffee and you want a meal in the morning coffee is might be for you except I think they're sold out there you go so yeah but that was your healthy living update let's talk about the world championships so let's just talk about the final match here it was a wolf Glick who has never been world champion but has made it there believe one time before he is national champion three times in a row fun fact I have beaten wolf at the 2011 national championships uh we were waiting in line for some TCG we decided battle I had a drastic real hey what I beat the national champion will with my angle enough with my Durant with my I can't even I can't even remember my whole team I think I had a semi serious i believe i had a bass Glynn I beat wolf we were waiting in line you hate masculine this was before my head of bass k'lon I had well this wasn't remember this is only you know of a Pokemon so I was very limited in what I could have bascal and had soaked and my strategy revolved around soaked but I did beat wolf I'm just saying I beat your world champion I guess so Jonathan had a Kyogre and a grout on go figure right Gengar talonflame manectric in bronzong wolf had Kyogre rip quaza go figure right mm-hmm gengar bronzong hey some Lee's polka we're looking really similar hitmontop and right you all right i will say i was excited about the ride shoe hitmontop we've seen years after years yeah ah Gengar Megan gars real cool knowns debating that there's no kangaskhan here i'm looking through the list another semifinalist was using kangaskhan I'm seeing I'm just let's just talk about all the pokemon here so another semifinalist gengar rock was a Raichu bronzong hitmontop Kyogre exert eous kangaskhan groudon bronzong hitmontop thunderous top eight require Kyogre hitmontop ride to bronze on gengar you see I'm reading you guys a pattern like yeah Wolf's Pokemon were not that unique natin and I'm not taking wolf is a great player I'm not taking any credit I'm and Jonathan and that was the first time I've ever seen in battle deemed to make smart decisions another top 8 here cresselia XR Nia's groudon smeargle salamence bronzong infernape sarnia's fungus we've seen fungus almost in every every pop ate here Salim and its its food goes to set him oh I'm sorry Amongus I would be real impressed if he was running to defeat real clutch absolutely I Kyogre bronzong I could just keep going but pretty much all the pokemon on the same after that point did you guys watch the world's match I did not now I missed it I can't remember where oh that's I was in recovery from from running my long run that morning yeah so I miss the final for the VGC but I was I was watching it during I'd it up on my computer at SummerSlam up up my TV it was pre-show SummerSlam so it didn't matter yeah so I watched it and I might get might get a little flack for this but it was probably one of the most boring world's matches I've ever watched hmm and the first game went to time then wolf had more Pokemon though he won and the second game was probably about two minutes less than two minutes i think was a minute 48 when it ended so a minute 48 away from going to time two now I've seen every worlds match since 2011 i would say probably the most exciting worlds match for me was 2011 because i was actually there in California at Worlds and that was super exciting when I say that these matches were boring I don't want do you mean that as I'm discrediting these players because they're clearly good players great players excellent players but I think we've all been to a Super Bowl and we've watched a boring super bowl and that doesn't take away from the two teams that made it to a Super Bowl let's not pretend just because it's a super bowl it must be exciting because ah I don't know about you guys the last couple Super Bowls I've watched not that exciting no but I don't get excited about that so I'm not I'm not sports get away at all the only football game I watched a year is the Super Bowl and I've been to some exciting super bowl parties and I've seen people get excited and I think that's the great thing especially when I was with my friend at 2011 worlds and a play happened and we saw people cheer he would look at me and go what happened I want I want to know why everyone is cheering and it was such a good experience and a good eye opener to explain why that move was exciting why that move was clutch why that did that why that situation involved cheering and I was watching uh this world and I was in slack we had a channel specifically two worlds and so we're all chatting and I wasn't the only one that was like hey guys is boring and no point in the slacks did somebody go oh my god that move the only part i remember was there was a point where one of one of Jonathan's Pokemon survived a move with like six HP and that was like it was his Ginga i think was his mega kegger if i'm not mistaken and that was like oh yeah I like that was because you want to see well I want to see I want to see them both win a match and I want to see what that final match comes out to ask to me it's always a little disappointing when one person just kind of wipes the other person where it's 2 and 0 like it happened here but that was a moment where like Oh Jonathan's Pokemon survived he can make a comeback and it didn't happen but like that was an exciting moment but over all those matches I was there just okay they were they were Pokemon matches and poke my matches are fun to watch but they they didn't stand out as like wow this was a world's match to remember it was a good match but not not memorable in any way so we get what I would say and then I don't know if I'll be able to express this the right way is the the current meta in the VGC is is what's making it boring just the fact that it really it really is concentrated around a very few Pokemon being the top Pokemon you know and like you know mirroring your experience I was in the room when station Park used pachirisu and one else was so exciting to that was a match that was legendary there was electricity in the room it was absolutely amazing and you know there was that create you know yes that year there was a ton of complaints because it was like genies genies genies everything is genies blah blah blah and you know his small bit of creativity added to the excitement of the match it doesn't take anything away from the players to say that in a boring meta it is really the skilled and advanced players who do well it just doesn't make an enjoyable match to watch it's it almost becomes like watching a chess game if you're not like super knowledgeable about chess history and everything in that case you're just watching yes to really intelligent and skilled people move playing pieces around the board and you're kind of like well sure I'm sure this is great and fantastic but it doesn't light a fire in my heart but when I see like a wide variety of Pokemon and just like really creative tricky things as opposed to people just pushing the meta the way that it is supposed to be pushed and making those right decisions that that becomes a much mix for a much more exciting match let me tell you to any any Pokemon game that goes the time is just slightly disappointing that if there's no out there's no outcome like you won because you had more Pokemon and wolf is a slower player I don't think anyone's going to disagree with that statement like he's a slower player and that's fine that's cool but for a world's match you you always want to kind of see it come down to the wire of like us to verse it's one verse two can can this get turned around or it's 1 verse 1 or it's 2 verse 2 and they're about to do some huge plays and to have that taken away because of time is slightly disappointing absolutely and we've got the bloodlust and we want to see Pokemon faint we want to see blood yeah Annie rated now I'm just kidding uh yeah but that was that was VGC world's congrats to not only masters I also watched the juniors i watch the seniors I'm not gonna lie I thought their matches were more exciting especially this the the seniors if i'm not mistaken uh I'm at it's hard because after like like 12 and under they all look like they're the same age so I can't recall in seniors of the junior but America one and the you could tell that the Japanese kid was just a little bummed out and right away the American kid went over hugged him and shared the spotlight with him and that was just a cool cool moment T of like what a good sport like not throwing in his face like being runner-up two worlds touchin mystic accomplishment and to see like good sportsmanship come out of that especially with such a younger age age division is just very heartwarming to see I don't know if people go back and watch world's I'm sure if you're into the TC if you're into the competitiveness you want to see how those matches unfolded but at the same time the Met is going to change so i'm not sure if there's much of a learning experience from there but i'm sure that's all archived on Twitter YouTube and you can go back and watch it for the for the TCG here talk about the Masters deck the master Division champion who won was shintaro 'i to have lee said that wrong I'm sorry they used a mega mega audino ax deck I'm just I could review the deck list but again the met is going to change its not like making this deck is beneficial to you Shintaro each use mega audino DX deck is the talk of the tournament featuring a mega evolution Pokemon that has garnered very little attention until now mega audino TX magical symphony does 110 damaged enough to take out shame and IX in one attack and most other Pokemon into attacks Pokemon Center lady is important to preventing the same thing from happening to mega audino ax by forcing many pokemon to attack a third time to take it out mega audino IX by the way has 220 HP tantaros innovated deck and masterful play were on full display on his way to his first World Championship so yeah I'm very familiar with j minus x that what that card was still relevant when I was playing I it's a different shame in Dhara when you play this Pokemon from your hand under your bench you may draw up until you have it's kind of similar the old shaymin let you search for pokemon all Shaymin e ex all shaman's have that similar bill ability of like han recycle meant so three mega audino x is for regular Audino exes touche many x's one who px1 migire nuh ex1 cobalion and one appt stone were in his deck and the runner up here greninja doe greninja break greninja two different types of greninja frogadier froakie and for Talan flames not sure how he was getting to talon flames without the other stage ones but i'm sure there's a card for that hey I know I Alan flame has an ability that you don't have to evolve it oh you just play it as a basic the ability of Gale wings if this pokemon is in your hand when you are setting up to play you may put it down as your Active Pokemon there you go Wow and it does 40 damage for one energy and also searches two cards from your deck and puts them into your hand that's super good for one an amazing wow wow that's real good but I guess that also makes your other three useless but the point is to get one of those for in your starting hand yeah but i'm sure the deck has a lot of like discard two cards to do this yeah there you go there's your TCG update there's you or I I didn't catch DZ G's which is is something I would have preferred to watch over i'm i'm a tcgplayer at heart I think that's a more exciting game I have a soft spot for shuffling cards yeah but i didn't i didn't catch those catch those but prior prior to the most of my watching was the TCG after the opening ceremony i flipped it on to the TCG stream and watched about three hours of that so congrats to all those players that one world seniors masters juniors I don't know if you guys have anything else to comment about that not especially now I'm just excited to see what the format is gonna be for next year yeah I really wanted to go back like you guys were talking about the other episode I want it to be just a lowland Pokemon however they want to make that happen but that's the best the time when it's most exciting for me to play when it's just like a small amount of new Pokemon agreed yep speaking of a low in pokemon i know we're running along but Logan we can get your impressions on the lowland pokemon is there just any Pokemon two or three that stood out to you that you're excited for that you're wanting to see more of obviously you're probably very excited for sun and moon oh yeah of course yeah i'm on this podcast ain't I hey um ok so like a little inform exeggutor is super super awesome I'm definitely in that camp of figure that he's amazing I am preternatural II excited about palace and and I also think that it's pronounced palace and because that sounds like the word palace Oh interesting yeah and he's like a big ol castle but I don't know I wait wait wait wait wait step it back I also was thinking that it's kind of palos and because it's also like power which a ghost would have a ghostly pallor oh yeah we're there you go man there's tons of wordplay in here no matter which way you go on that sank hats pokemon but man I hope that I hope that he's good I feel like golurk was really bad and he's got the same typing so it's probably just gonna be the exact same amount bad but I want him to be good I mean he's got stuff where you wear like water can't hurt him right or maybe water can turn right yeah we don't know fully yeah um if you take away that weakness I feel like he'd be competitively viable and all I want is for it just to take a sand castle to a Pokemon a bit that would just be great so mostly I'm excited about palace and so I'm telling you um but I love them all love all the little guys maybe q obviously everybody's fan of that I am too no different than anyone with that mimic you so cute they Oh be where's little baby form below missed an opportunity with we bear I'm telling you man I'm going to play with me on that stuff was a good name and stuff Elizabet ER than beware but we bear would have been the best name so the theory I saw and stuff will and beware is duffels description is that it doesn't want to be hugged or touch mm-hm and when I walls into beware beware is so strong that no it can break trees in half and it can crush things by hugging to it pretty much grows up and since no one has accepted that they shouldn't hug or touch it it has become this vicious machine killing bear with that is beware I like it is another in a line of a long line of Pokemon descriptions where yeah they seem really cute and in the game they're fine but then if you read the description of what they do you're like whoa what is this doing in this children's game this is terrifying they're all I don't know like the like Palace and sucking kids into the into the ocean basically or like it underneath muddy sand just huh there's like a lot of Pokemon that murder children it says there should be uh add them to the list yep well what would have a good transition but what we'll do now is we'll take a break when we come back I'll have the interview with Ophidian again it's he's a wrestler very awesome dude talks about Pokemon go on the road he's playing through pokemon black 2 which is for some reason one of the games will likes other people like black and white and black and white 2 i'm not the only one the exit was better but that's me and so yeah you should check it out and then after that we'll be back with our pokemon of the week he picked the lamp in unless i forgot what he picked because i recorded that like two days ago but i'm pretty sure you pick lamp it so that's a pro point of the week we'll be back with that give you a move setting everything so we'll be right back and we are back from our break you guys have probably heard earlier in the episode that we had an interview for you guys so here we are I am sitting down with ophidian I probably said that wrong again I feel bad oh oh don't no worries my friend here I'm gonna give you an even better introduction I am the venomous and vile serpent from the Nile the one and only master ho snake style the Cobra supanova Ophidian it was possibly way better than what I could have done awesome we're glad glad that you were here sitting down we're gonna we're gonna chat a bit about Pokemon about wrestling about a bunch of things before we dive into things you introduced yourself but let's break that down even more you wrestle over at chikara yes sir and you've been doing that since 2007 absolutely I uh I came on board in 2006 and made my professional wrestling debut in 2007 Chikara pro for those that aren't very familiar as I essentially a comic book come to life with the lucha super party everything about our company about chikara is like watching a live action on a book anime cartoon whatever your preference maybe um such colorful and lively characters um take myself for example an anthropomorphic breakdancing ancient Egyptian you can't argue with that I want I have a bunch of wrestling related questions first but i liked i like to open and close with some pokemon stuff just to kind of tie tie everything together and i know you have a pokemon themed promotion that you want to promote and will totally get to that but begin things off do you have a favorite Pokemon well you see uh it's a little difficult right because with each generation that is come and gone you know your favorites tend to change and sometimes you get those updates you know to a Pokemon that uh I kind of makes you change your mind on what you may really like but I've always always always been a huge fan of Hunter there's just something about his look his deviousness that that or that he has that uh I don't think any other Pokemon since has been able to replicate that's awesome and most people jump straight to Ganga but I like that you kept it at hunter hunters often overlooked he's a very cool pokemon hunter has no arms but yet still has hands it's very handy unintended even beyond that I mean even some of the newer generation pokemon you know I'm so psyched that hawlucha exists now and not to say he's my favorite and not by far but look wise it's exciting to see a bird type was a mask thrown on his head yeah hawlucha was one of the pokemon that I definitely got super psyched about and it came like right time right place because that's when I was getting back into wrestling so that was like a double win for me when I encountered that Pokemon wise just before this will kind of tie inch wide try to do some transitions hear you i'm assuming you're on the road a lot yes so pokemon go seems like the game that's best suited to that unless you didn't jump on that bandwagon oh I absolutely did uh I can tell you right now I'm a level 22 trainer and I've seen and call about 95 oh c'mon wow that's awesome it gets a little difficult sometimes because while we do get to travel and we get to see the road um it's hard to catch a Pokemon while you're in a car especially since the updates yeah totally is for being on the road with with other wrestlers and whatnot did they catch that Crais too or is that is that mostly you or has that spread throughout you know the rest of your crew Oh obviously culturally you have a lot of people playing now that aren't traditionally Pokemon fans and I think that's definitely true of the ways infected our locker room you have a lot of people that normally wouldn't play are playing it um just because it is something to do while you're stuck in a car with somebody for six to seven hours at a time or I won't put you on the spot are you are you the Pokemon expert out of the locker room or to somebody surpass you oh so it goes back and forth between myself and worker ant who has been applying to become a Pokemon professor as I he's an avid uh tcgplayer uh-huh that's awesome we both play together although I haven't been able to keep up with the X&Y expansion that has come out um just given the I've been helping my wife board with our business cause a champion we custom-make a professional wrestling gear and that's kind of call to my attention so my ability to play as much hasn't been there but I still do with them out if it was a lot of play against worker ant so yeah I was I was that my listeners know I was very end of the TCG for about almost three years competitively going to tournaments every single weekend and I can't imagine being on the road like you guys because even when I was traveling just on Saturdays and Sundays I was like this is too much mm-hmm I played a multiple TCG's uh pokemon and uh magic at the same time and a man wasn't much of a life but between those two things in pro wrestling it was uh I'm consuming but i will say that you've been able to catch on like release parties and even up some local or tournaments in philadelphia kareena myself masted public playing pokemon that's incredible I wanted to touch on that your masks and earlier you said your business now from what I've researched you seem to make all your own gear you and your wife that hasn't always been the case as a very young Ophidian uh you know did not know how to do such things but I married into seamstress thing I thought my wife has been a suits just her whole life as well as like a family you know her grandmother her mother and now she is one as well so now I do I produce I creedon all my own masks um as well as the gear that I wear and she uh creates most of the locker room not all but our say majority about eighty-five percent of the outfits that you might see how much a car show or made by her let me let me back up real quick Cara is your full-time gig yes how many how many days is that is that a five-day-a-week is that a seven day a week is that a two-day week how how much time is that for you so we have a training facility in Northeast Philadelphia called the wrestle factory where I run classes there alongside mike quackenbush who is the head trainer and a few other guys like drew gulak and chuck taylor um Holloway can fire ant and I have classes three to four days a week depending on the week you know if their shows you know big events on the weekend the stuff you know we may have to cancel our class in order to run our offense okay all right so then where does the where does the time fit in for making the outfits is that another day or two a week you're dedicating to that or it so it tends to be where if I teach a class on a monday wednesday and friday i tend to be at home with mrs de cobra on a tuesday and thursday you know smashing out some gear that is to say if i'm not on the road or if that is her main job first and foremost that is what she does I'm not just with shakarpur but with many other companies that she creates care for anybody from talent and w.e to TNA wearing of honor and around the world and I help out on the days that I can that's really really cool I wanted to kind of stick on the wrestling thing here year you're on the road you're you're making outfits your you teaching new upcoming wrestlers what happens in a situation when you before I asked the question there's no more like hidden side gigs you're doing right those those are here those are album there might be a little side business is slinging pokemon cards on the streets but you know you can't really talk about that a lot the podcast I think understandable I i was i was looking at your your Wikipedia your history your you know your wrestling database you've been hurt before so what happens in a situation when when you're hurt ah man uh it can definitely very I'll give you two examples there was a night in which I broke my jaw and the opening round of a tournament that took place all in one night and I broke my jaw beating my opponent I was doing a 450 off of the top rope and as I was coming down the points of his knees called my jaw and broke it but I still got the three count in that moment huh so visual right there luckily there was enough impact from the rest of my body hitting them that I was able to beat him and I had to go into the second round with a broken jaw kinda just taped up and locked into place and competed in the sacker and I of course lost very quickly but uh you know and there's moments like that where my body can still go despite the fact that I can't really move my mouth whereas in another instance I've torn my MCL and upon Tara my MCL in the ring I dropped immediately I couldn't stand up and luckily that was during a six-man tag where I had two partners to help me out when those moments I roll out of the ring I have to leave immediately I can't even stand I can't get back up and it's it's scary fell was alone in that situation would have been a completely different scenario you know you have to take away something the fans want to see which is you know action in the ring um lucky enough in that moment to have people by my side you know five other participants that go on without me as I rolled out and call up no ball dreading having to find out what was wrong with my leg right right so then recovery time are you just focused on on the recovery or are you still trying to do your other side stuff just do i want to say pay the bills i don't wanna make it seem like dire but i would imagine where that that's the thing you do is wrestle and when you're out you're out absolutely but uh luckily with the way you know social media and uh being a personality has progressed and evolved we can make ends meet beyond professional wrestling right so i have the ability now to garner are following online whether it's through social media you know like a twitter or facebook or things like that or even open up patreon and and create content for something like that and have something that i could provide people well you know willing there want to see it um and of course now as I wasn't always but now the trainer at the wrestle factory um so there's more than for those that are smart enough to thee to the workings and ins and outs of not only being a personality but of professional wrestling there's way more to do and more ways to make ends meet so like for example I have a patreon with with closeted champion which is our company and of course you know being a trainer at the wrestle factory right right you make the mask you wear the mask for our listeners if you haven't checked it out you can well where would be the best place they could see your ring gear and what you look like well of course all my social medias you'll clearly see me on any of it it's all at both fit in Cobra or you can check out closet champion which is at closet champion or closet champion com yeah so take a second because you take a second and look now back to back to you your ring gear is pretty outstanding I would imagine that the mass that you make and or where are probably pretty popular with kids surprisingly my scary face is loved by young children show wise so you do the show you do your matches what is the general response of the fans are are you are you well received are you somebody that kids want to run up to or kids don't want to run up to you how's that play out what I truly love about chikara pro and you know the way the independent wrestling scene works is we're not contracted to any one company so we have the ability to travel and work for other companies and go around the world and perform with whoever wants to hire us we're independent contractors right but you know my home is jakar pro not primarily I work all their events and well now you know you go other places but chakara pro is a family from the environment so we have lots of children have lots of families that come and it's such a positive and great environment and where you have the ability to have kids that feel comfortable and safe enough to come up to you and hang out with you and talk to you I want to see you and take pictures and and um be interactive children like me i would say uh my snake style is very popular amongst all types i want to take that question you know your fans people enjoying you in the ring people coming up buying your stuff i want to flip that 180 and i stalked you twitter and i saw you tweet a lot about SummerSlam I saw you I saw you tweet that you were very excited Dean Ambrose won the WWE Championship it seems like you not only are wrestler but you are a fan of other promotions is that accurate absolutely uh despite what a lot of what I think ends up happening with a lot of not just professional wrestlers but if you're musician if you're an actor if you're if you're moving into your field that you grew up loving and are trying to become active in that scene you tend to become bitter towards what you what you loved about the industry and I've made sure that I've stayed connected and grounded in a way that allows me to still enjoy what others are producing um because without them right without that without being if I can't enjoy the content that others are producing that i myself am not going to produce content that I feel produced content that others will enjoy as well and from if I can't take a step back and look at what's going on and go mad that's fun that's enjoyable that's at the end of the day that's what made me a fan of professional wrestling they're kidding me still loves you know being able to watch SummerSlam or things like that we had we had Xavier woods aka Austin create on about four or five episodes ago and I was I was hesitant to do that interview not because of Austin because i love i love the new day i love Xavier woods and everything I was hesitant because I didn't know how my audience being primarily Pokemon would react to it and it went over super well and I think Austin was very easy-going enough and talked in a way where his main point was sometimes people don't see us us as in wrestlers outside of a box they just go oh you're only a wrestler and they're surprised when that person that could apply to football or sports or musicians i could buy anywhere that oh you only must do this so you only must wrestle and everyone was shocked her like oh austin has like this gaming channel and plays games and he's into pokemon and you obviously clearly into pokemon playing the card game and pokemon go and and knowing hawlucha like that's such a step above all the I mean everyone knows the first 150 foot once you break that that first hundred fifty it's like oh you actually do know something what do you do though outside of wrestling I'm sure there's there's something else where are you well I'm a huge gamer um without a doubt and same in the way that Austin Creed is and I can tell you right now i'm currently replaying final fantasy seven and I'm gotten back up to the third disc currently and in the North creator and stepped out with North Korea Tourism going for the ultimate weapons now but I've always been a huge RPG nerd to uh it 100% um it's great to be able to be able to take stuff like that and take it on the roads we do have a lot of time and a lot of free time even if i'm not saying free time is we don't do anything or the cells but would also you had to do if you're sitting in a car for like this yeah yesterday was on the road idea i had an event at a summer camp for autistic um cerebral palsy Down syndrome kids with different physical and mental disabilities as like their big in a summer event and for me that was six hours of driving so sitting in a car for that long what are you gonna do I'm gonna maybe pop on poking in a pokemon black 2 because I just what I went back to start playing or Final Fantasy 7 um to absolutely love I can't get enough of the Final Fantasy franchise on top of being able to play stuff like like even Pokemon go blub support my poor mom black 2 is currently uh I've take a step back and clear some space on Maya device for it but I will be returning to it once final fantasy 7 is done I would then safely assume you're excited for Final Fantasy 15 yes absolutely I like the open world changes I like the fact that we're going to be able to explore the world in the way that they're presenting to us it's the natural progression for you know the genre we're able to live in the world you know linearly for years but what happens when we don't have that linear path anymore which they completely do you know deviated from one like final fantasy 13 which I was a big fan of but they you know they corrected by final fantasy 13 2 and 13 3 well they allowed you to deviate from that linear path and to have something that feels or looks as if it is completely unlit I'm excited for it give me a role to explore on my own and let me fail miserably speaking of video games and stuff the first time I actually was aware of you and your character was you I might get the the event wrong but I believe it was paxa mania West I'm bomb crew yes that was the first time that I was aware of you and you know they're introducing all the wrestlers and they're all people in the game industry and then you and somebody else came out and you guys started doing backflips and I was like there's no way that's somebody in the game industry like I feel like these guys are real hustlers and and alex navarro of giant bomb we're like these guys are actually real wrestlers what can you lay out that like what how did this happen the packs of mania crew actually this was a pax east was a blast I've never been to a pax event up until that point and I have some connections through kaiju big battel to those guys and cod you big battle is a tokusatsu themed professional wrestling company if you don't remove it took hissatsu is is essentially are the Godzilla Type monsters or if you think of Power Rangers or this you know sentai the villains that exist when they're in their giant forms the monsters in the no suit that's tokusatsu there's a combination of those guys being fans at Saqqara and them also knowing uh some some of the guys from kaiju big battel who were able to get ahold of us for that event as well lucky enough that you know there were fans of Jakara and the right people know how to get ahold of us it was there's a blast and they paid us often out on a battle them in a on stage from the world we walked on stage did I flips and like how about we just give you a lot of cash and you not beat us up all right do you remember that you can uh you can tend to be asking me all you want I'll gladly take your money that event overall though other than you know knowing the the Godzilla like wrestlers were you in connections with the the people from giant bomb or the other people in the gaming industry was that something that you know you hung out with him you talked with them or even to extend that further they wanted you to come back because it seems like this packs of mania thing is never-ending we are uh I hope you know that we're able to come back as they did extend an invitation for as I guess they're getting more involved with packs and are doing something with packs west um but that is not something we're able to do but we're hoping at least when they're back on the East Coast that you know come next year unpacks East habits again that it is a reoccurring thing as they were happy with us they're all I was happy with hanging out with those guys there's my first time meeting all of them and uh as I'm sure you know me to an event like pax's um its massive and uh it's a lot to take in a lot going on around you yeah totally I'd two panels there that day the paxil mania and then the kaiju big battel which is the tokusatsu wrestling company had an event of the day that I helped work as well speaking of events you guys have an event coming up I believe it's called the king of trios yes tell me about this this seems fascinating so king of trios is the largest professional wrestling tournament every single year and I mean largest as in the amount of performers that are on the show sixteen teams of three compete against each other to be called a king of trios and this year maybe even queen of trios as we have our first all-female teams as more than one of multiple female teams in the tournament and their teams from all around the world from Japan from the UK from Mexico from Canada anywhere you can think of that has professional wrestling throughout the years there has been representation in the tournament and that happens over Labor Day weekend this year I'm involved in a tournament as well my trio the Snakepit are battling one of the all-female trios from Japan team j WP I wanted to ask this I forgot a little bit earlier what you just reminded me we look at you can look at a promotion like WWE and they don't women wrestle women men no Russell men but chakara is one of the not the few but is one of the promotions where men can wrestle women or vice versa what are your thoughts on that overall like I've seen you do a couple matches with women competitors and they were they were outstanding but what are your thoughts when when it comes down to that so my experience coming into professional wrestling is a little different from others I was trained originally by lightning mike quackenbush was the founder of Jakara pro claudio castagnoli who is now Cesaro in double w/e and chris hero who is Cassius oh no in NXT if you're familiar with NXT history when some of those guys at a depart sara del rey became one of the other head trainers for the school who is now the assistant head coach or head trainer in NXT so i spent years training with sara del rey and learning a lot of the ins and outs from you know one of the female competitors and in my mind it was never a question as to whether or not you know you can have the inter-gender wrestling or that female competitors are different you know in the ring we're all the same they getting kicked in the face of bore you know punched or slammed around is still the same whether it's a man or woman doing it it still hurts a lot sure and I'm excited to see more and more of it happening around the world it'll never progress farther unless a company like w.e right the big dog unless a day and state it within their I was in their world but it's something that will inevitably happen as companies like chakara the web and international Fowler are known around the world you know we've done towards it UK we've done shows in Japan we've done to a shame in Germany you know as we start to do it and get bigger and bigger and have stuff like king of trios where you have female teams female competitors battling male competitors um it just opens up the possibility for matchups and things that happen that would never exist otherwise you know professional wrestling's all of its at the end of the day it's a performance art right and the more colors we have available to create art with the bigger the picture the better the pictures we may be able to create right so having more competitors having different types of competitors having females of different shapes and sizes and from all different walks of life being able to battle at male competitors as well means that we get to create larger big Ernie maybe even more vibrant art and that's exciting yeah yes that was that was a fantastic explanation going back to king of trios or might there may or may not be a pokemon theme applied to it oh oh yes there is if you out do you want to talk about that before the Pokemon crazy even kicked in Pokemon go I should say it may put one obvious he's always been massive but um earlier in the year you know we slapped a Pokemon seemed to our shows where every time we'd reveal a team we do in the style of the TV show you know who's at Pokemon instead of you who's that trio um and then you'd have it revealed and silip you know silhouette Stalin revealed who the trio's were and we've been doing that for the entire year um as well as doing an event called the Victory Road rally where we're setting up a scavenger hunt at Pokemon gyms around the Easton the city of Easton which is where king of trios is this year to our scavenger hunt with our competitors stationed at these different gyms in order to get the clothes on the one hopes that you battle and take the gym over for whether your valor mystic or instinct go team valor um and that takes place on our second day so you have the Pokemon themed event with all of our marketing and advertising is all decked out in the style of Pokemon and you have a even animation with the director of fun mike quackenbush dresses ash uh model that's our ass and all their promos as well as the who's that you know who is that trio reveal alongside of stuff like the victory road rally using Pokemon go because it's the only way you'll know where the gyms are as you'll have to use Pokemon go in order to complete the scavenger hunt to find all seven gyms that we have mapped out right right were there people on the roster when this when this theme was applied that are like what what is this Pokemon thing why are we doing this or was everyone very cool of like yeah let's do this kind of thing uh it was fun having to a explained as a character on our show named Asher Hatfield who is the old-timey King of Swing he is a an old-timey baseball player like from the early 1900s and despite the fact that it is 2016 the man had no idea I had no concept of Pokemon at all it's great explaining to him how that worked out where guys like myself and worker ant were beyond excited just hoping that we had pokemon theme Pokemon a style t-shirts and I and of course we do I king of trios font this year's in the Pokemon styling mm-hmm and just having all this merchandise now that is a crossover between Shekhar which is obviously what we love is this comic book come to life pro wrestling company and Pokemon you know a video game which is also i know the huge aspect of my life and in work frances while having that crossover just that yeah it warms the cockles of our soul speaking of Pokemon do you have a favorite generation or a favorite game in the series we you said what you said black to earlier as was currently in your D s aya I'm I uh I don't know if this is a touchy subject and I so I'm sorry if it is but I'm a fan of the rom hacks and ok because of this you know emerald and Ruby have a ton of them so flora sky is one of my favorite hacks so I would have to say because uh because of that and I of course like the the the stuff that was introduced and I'm old in ruby sapphire around the gender that generation of Pokemon might have to say that would be it mostly because the hacks that have come out for that those games are been a lot of fun to play ok no that's totally a fair answer I don't sell some some people are not for you know tampering with the og allah der totally is is Pokemon Sun and Moon on your radar have you been following that is is that something you're planning on picking up or maybe you know a little bit later what's what's your stance there I'm absolutely plan on getting it 100% as I'm super excited for it I got the play action wise well but not as much as I wanted to because I broke my 3d s on the road which is why I'm back to playing pokemon black 2 0 comes full circle sale liquids and uh 3d asses don't get along sure and of course I mean I I just couldn't justify buying another three dias at the time I'm hoping that somebody in my life gets me one without me having to down and get one again but uh I'm super excited for it and come closer to Christmas I'm hoping that another three BS appears in my life yeah that would be that would be quite the gift besides Pokemon you said you were a big gamer what about favorite game just kind of favorite all all-time game is there one that sticks out as a final fantasy 7 is it something else so Allah far classic games go as far as like let's say a pre PlayStation 2 i'm going with a legend of dragoon which is a PlayStation game it was absolutely uh it wasn't a greatest RPG of all time but uh that's no secret that I've got dragon tattoos on my arms uh and also mortal kombat tattoos on my back which is the another story for another time i guess they had legend of dragoon is without a doubt my favorite game from that generation there's just something about it i've been able to go back and replay and the the fighting system they introduced where it was timed attacks where you can run up no attack and if you hit the button at the right time you can combo and keep calling him for an RPG that was and they did they'd massive that technique so well for an RPG to have that interactivity in a time based RPG was mind boggling to it young me I was hooked on in a circle back and play but now currently more combat 10 beat out mass the mass effect franchise by just a little bit um Mortal Kombat ten just so smooth it's got its flaws but I don't care yeah all I can I can do it can be as flawed as it wants to be I don't that's so good that's awesome but before we wrap up break that question down a little bit further is there a favorite console that you have out of all of them who I would probably have to go play station um the original yes um just for the library games and part of its probably nostalgic because of course I mean like gaming has only gotten better over the years but there's just their games from that console that I could still go back and play to this to this day I mean despite I mean I've you know I've had everything from a Nintendo to xbox one right now and we can all go back and play classic games like sure I can go back and play mario but I can't play it like I can go back and play final fantasy 7 or twisted metal or a legend of dragoon or reloaded um or any any of the millions of games that have come out for that console spyro the dragon or crash bandicoot it's just I can play just about anything for that console to be happy with what's in front of me what's in my hands well king of trios is coming up do you have you I'm sure you know the exact date of when people can actually check that out yes September second third and fourth the three-day tournament king of trios starts night one and then on the night two and three it continues on put on my to the rateable adores tournament the king of fliers kicks off a little night three we have the tag team gauntlet as well as the finals of readable adores and the finals of king of trios so you have multiple tournaments happening over these three days as well as a fan Conclave where the guys or you'll have a interactivity with the performers the two-hour event the beginning of that day the crew from continue the YouTube channel will be there as well holding a gaming tournament for WF no mercy what a game it's what a game yes a very frustrating game if if you're playing worker ant and a lot of other cool things like being able to do karaoke with the wrestlers are the victory road rally and things like that so that's September second third and fourth in easton pennsylvania you can find information on that at chakara procomp and if you care to do so when I'm reading here is all of chakara schedule is posted on chikara procomp absolutely their twitter is just chikara Rove yes everything for them their Facebook their Twitter all that is jakara pro and you you set your Twitter a little bit earlier but people forget people forget where can our listeners find you you can find me on all forms of social media at ophidian Cobra that's oph I di a n Cobra ophidian Cobra or check out the company claw at closet champion on twitter facebook Instagram all that fun stuff well well thank you so much ophidian good luck at your king of trios tournament I am excited to find out and see what happens thank you for having me oh yes oh actually before we close cuz I'm gonna bring us to a break ophidian do you want to pick our pokemon of the week we usually talk about one specific Pokemon to wrap up the show I want to put it in your hands which Pokemon would you like us to focus on mmm i think the pokemon that you guys should talk about this week is lambent excellent choice perfect awesome we will be back with lampin if you have you're curious about chikara if you want to know more head over to chikar Oh procom all the information is there when we come back we will be talking about lamp it our pokemon of the week alright and we are back with our pokemon of the week here it's been a last couple episodes if it's super effective have been like pushing two hours so hopefully you guys like that I don't know I like Molly's gonna complain about more content right right it just takes you longer to finish I guess yeah I don't know why you would complain i love along podcast but that's just me both idian picked a lamp it which is the evolution of lit wick also the pre evolution to one of our favorites here Chandelure yeah not right off the bat this lamp it fit into like a little cup or you probably wouldn't use them in a normal tournament but what were you talking about on our break was what if there was like a tournament where you could only use middle stage pokemon some kind of middle cup yeah like Metapod Wartortle Ivysaur lamp it the middle form of her unique list that I can never remember delusion do you Jin duo's in you know that that would actually be a great tournament because like the middle stages get no love on any Pokemon really well you have a little stage that you really really identify with I can't think of one Egypt kadabra sure Pikachu's is technically a middle stage yeah Kadabra I would I could I could feel like I alakazam just way cooler though right yeah there are the most of the time there are awkward teens that's their the honker teen version of pokemon like show keep a joke is okay yeah yeah Mitch's list he looks less awkward than Machamp I'm gonna go ahead the chimp has four arms though how can I you that's that's money what's better than two arms boy ah let me read us a Logan will have a move said here let me read something about lamp it Levitt can sense when somebody is about to die boom it visits and steals the spirits from the person's body through most often found in deep force it wanders through cities and hangs around near hospitals to absorb the spirits of fallen it uses the spirits it absorbs to fuel its fire on occasion it has been known to work with lit wick to lead people to the Ghost World while stealing life energy I don't know why I decided to do that voice but I know dad spooky music in the back i thought about it uh yeah lamp it's terrifying yeah it's another pleasant for children pokemon right also the ghost world I'm assuming that's not the same as the distortion world it is the land of wind and spirits you should be well familiar with that should I mm-hmm have you never seen mr. sparkle ax know that what you are the biggest Simpsons man in the whole world stone mr. sparkle I shall banish you to the land of wind and spirits yeah yeah wow I am familiar with mr. sparkle I am floored no not get that immediately you're very lucky dishes miss you six apart always gets me um lamp it is a Pokemon her alleged yeah yeah ghost pokemon a ghost fire pokemon to be exact Logan what's your move set for the middle cup I feel like we need a better name than middle cup now middle cups good man was like little cup what about the teenage no that's just not better all right you got me there okay so middle cup a lamp it can learn trick room just like Chandelure is a big brother um and probably gonna partly using mana on a trick room team and although he's still got real good stats um I mean I honestly I don't know what the the range is on middle evolutions but I know his grown-up form has really really great special attack and 95 still seems pretty legit for a mil sage we're gonna you can go with a trick room that's fine he also learns will-o-wisp and willow wisp is good and no matter what cup you're in she can get somebody burned we can give him shadow ball yeah you learned that real real nice stabby ghost move that'll take advantage of his special attack um probably the best will it goes move that you can use hundred accuracy 80 damage yeah it's it's a really solid move oh yeah shadow balls real popular mm-hmm um he's you know like you if you don't want to go with substitute he's got you can have like in paradise since you're going with um really like focus our attack a special attacks focused build you probably wanna give him a choice scarf because he pretty speedy but he needs help getting up there actually is he nice 55 speed okay so you if you give them the choice car pure your banking I'm going first if you give him trick room by the way you probably wanna give them a focus sash so you just guaranteed to get trick room off and that means your team is gonna be slow guys which is probably pretty cool for a teenage cup um but I think I definitely go with will-o'-wisp let's go ahead and build the trick room give them Shadow Ball and higher tank movie and now has about heat wave as an egg move heat wave it's you both opponents fire type moves stab it up that's very true it's it's another stab move it can take advantage of his other type so yeah he wave is a good one ten percent chance of burn boom so you're gonna burn them all up with willow wisp in heat wave yeah you Gavin that's a pretty that's a pretty solid build I really want this teenage cup to heaven now you could probably substitute out I mean if you want if you're more of a defensive player you can probably substitute out will-o'-wisp for like protect so you still have your trick room you have your protective and you have either shadow ball or whatever fire type move you want heat wave Fire Blast flamethrower if you're gonna add protect I wouldn't take away will-o-wisp for it because willow is gets even better if you have protect in addition okay let block and get extra damage then maybe take away the fire type move just keep the Shadow Ball yeah I don't know i mean i guess it's it's a how you want to play it yeah it also depends on what's more popular in the meta you know if you're seeing lots of psychic and other ghost types out there then you want the Shadow Ball you're seeing a lot of grass insect insect Wow oh my brain insect I dried grass bug ice if that's something that's big then you're going to want that heat wave I mean honestly keeping both moves is pretty pretty solid so maybe you want either will-o'-wisp or trick room but maybe not both I don't know I don't know if you're doing will Louis you probably don't want to do flame body slam body gives thirty percent pants of burn if they make physical contact with you Ray so you probably want to go with flash fire yeah flash fire yeah definitely traitor I guess could be a thing but oh yeah we're talking about a middles cup which has like no like I don't know what would the threat what the threats would be with like a reflector aura barrier yeah um infiltrator would allow for a willow wisp to burn if somebody's put up a safeguard to prevent status moves yeah interesting if you get a shiny lamp it it has a purple glow instead of a blue glow it also has blue eyes instead of yellow eyes which is a nice touch lamp it represents October and the you Nova horoscope I had no clue there was a you Nova horoscope in generation five lamp it and its evolutionary relatives have shadow tag instead of infiltrator as their hidden ability however they cannot obtain their hidden ability in these games and lamp it is based on an oil street lamp which i think is obvious when you look at them yeah kind of assuming you have that vernacular of what an oil lamp on the street looks like then yeah he looks just like it alright let's talk about horoscope here Logan when were you born what's the month I'm in August I'm a Leo OC URL you are a braver brave very brave iary okay I'll take breviary I will you don't know
