B what's up everyone welcome to (0:21 - 0:26)
the (0:24 - 0:29)
595th episode of the Pokemon podcast I (0:26 - 0:31)
thought we were in the 400 still we've (0:29 - 0:35)
done too the clutches of defeat too many (0:31 - 0:37)
of these episodes I'm your host Steve (0:35 - 0:40)
with me is Hannah I am here and I am (0:37 - 0:42)
actually genuinely super excited for the (0:40 - 0:43)
DLC this (0:42 - 0:47)
week uh Greg also here I am here and I (0:43 - 0:52)
am not excited for the DLC this (0:47 - 0:56)
week uh so there was a 4 and a half (0:52 - 0:59)
minute trailer uh that came out this (0:56 - 1:02)
week uh so that means for every 1 minute (0:59 - 1:04)
we're going to spend an hour analyzing (1:02 - 1:07)
and breaking down the the trailer that's (1:04 - 1:12)
how that works um but before we get to (1:07 - 1:14)
everything in that (1:12 - 1:18)
trailer it is it is officially once (1:14 - 1:22)
again the year the Year of (1:18 - 1:24)
cagal and I just wanted to say that (1:22 - 1:27)
event yesterday was very good for what (1:24 - 1:27)
it (1:27 - 1:32)
was yeah relatively simple but it seemed (1:27 - 1:34)
like almost everyone got a shiny out of (1:32 - 1:36)
it if they played (1:34 - 1:40)
it yeah I I only played uh I was gifted (1:36 - 1:42)
the not by Niantic somebody on my (1:40 - 1:45)
friends list gifted me a ticket to the (1:42 - 1:46)
event which I think was like two bucks (1:45 - 1:49)
or something um uh it just gave you the (1:46 - 1:53)
quest line twice uh so you would get a (1:49 - 1:58)
10 step research 40 cagal total if you (1:53 - 2:02)
paid for it you would get 80 cagal total (1:58 - 2:04)
um and like most Pokémon go events you (2:02 - 2:06)
loved it if you got a shiny and it was (2:04 - 2:09)
the worst event ever if you didn't get a (2:06 - 2:12)
shiny well I didn't so it's the worst (2:09 - 2:16)
ever yeah oh yeah it was $2 okay um but (2:12 - 2:18)
it was nice cuz like uh even if you (2:16 - 2:19)
didn't get a shiney like I turned on a (2:18 - 2:22)
lucky egg because they had two times XP (2:19 - 2:25)
for nice great excellent and I (2:22 - 2:28)
personally found kagal to be easy to (2:25 - 2:33)
excellent yeah it's one of those bigger (2:28 - 2:36)
Pokemon so I just wanted I I did not (2:33 - 2:38)
want to start our episode without (2:36 - 2:40)
acknowledging the year of (2:38 - 2:42)
cagal they've been going into those (2:40 - 2:44)
catch Mastery events more and more for (2:42 - 2:47)
the last couple of years I think it's (2:44 - 2:50)
because they want to have the events (2:47 - 2:52)
only be accessible to people who aren't (2:50 - 2:54)
playing solely with a plus or a (2:52 - 2:57)
Plus+ or any of those devices on where (2:54 - 3:00)
right they want you to actually be their (2:57 - 3:03)
C catching the Pokemon by throwing the (3:00 - 3:03)
Pokeball please play the game we watch (3:04 - 3:11)
how we want you to play (3:08 - 3:12)
please uh all (3:11 - 3:16)
right the big news here that was it I I (3:12 - 3:17)
just wanted just wanted to talk about (3:16 - 3:20)
konal for like 45 (3:17 - 3:22)
seconds okay so this is off the this is (3:20 - 3:24)
the press release December 7th today the (3:22 - 3:26)
Pokemon company International announced (3:24 - 3:29)
more details on the hidden treasure of (3:26 - 3:32)
area Zero part two the Indigo dis DLC (3:29 - 3:35)
for the Pokemon scarlet and violet video (3:32 - 3:39)
games that is how they would were that (3:35 - 3:41)
very long game we made we need to make (3:39 - 3:44)
sure we use every title (3:41 - 3:47)
possible the Indigo dis launches (3:44 - 3:48)
exclusively on the Nintendo switch (3:47 - 3:51)
family of systems on December 14th we (3:48 - 3:53)
don't have a date for the record we can (3:51 - 3:56)
assume or just guess that it's going to (3:53 - 3:58)
be like how they (3:56 - 4:01)
did the teal mask (3:58 - 4:04)
uh which was UTC time or sorry not UTC (4:01 - 4:08)
time it was 10:00 a.m. Japan time and (4:04 - 4:11)
believe is when it came out which I (4:08 - 4:12)
don't know do the math on that I think (4:11 - 4:15)
that was like 8:00 pm us central time or (4:12 - 4:18)
something something like that uh I just (4:15 - 4:20)
want to remind people like that the (4:18 - 4:22)
crown Tundra and the a of armor did not (4:20 - 4:23)
come out at the same time they were very (4:22 - 4:27)
different times so again we can assume (4:23 - 4:28)
that maybe it comes out at the same time (4:27 - 4:32)
but we don't have a time as of (4:28 - 4:36)
now uh they showed a new cinematic (4:32 - 4:38)
trailer their press release is (4:36 - 4:42)
incredibly short for uh the (4:38 - 4:45)
website uh (4:42 - 4:45)
so can we start with the weird let's (4:46 - 4:50)
start with the weird thing sure they (4:48 - 4:54)
showed a brand new mechanic yep uh it's (4:50 - 4:58)
called the Synchro machine poke Park 3 (4:54 - 5:00)
it's poke Park 3 (4:58 - 5:02)
pky Park's bad (5:00 - 5:08)
like I don't it's not though what once (5:02 - 5:10)
players progress far enough in their (5:08 - 5:12)
adventure of the Hidden area the hidden (5:10 - 5:14)
treasure of area Zero part two the (5:12 - 5:16)
Indigo disc they will be able to use a (5:14 - 5:18)
device called the Synchro machine to see (5:16 - 5:21)
the world in the eyes of their Pokemon (5:18 - 5:23)
while the Synchro machine while (5:21 - 5:24)
synchronized with one of their Pokemon (5:23 - 5:27)
they can move around and battle wild (5:24 - 5:30)
Pokemon a fresh way to play the game it (5:27 - 5:32)
appears that the device is a prototype (5:30 - 5:34)
players can use it once they help the (5:32 - 5:36)
scientists in the terrarium with her (5:34 - 5:41)
research so just like a a super fun fact (5:36 - 5:43)
this was the lady that Nintendo told me (5:41 - 5:46)
not to talk to oh I was like I was like (5:43 - 5:48)
oh like she has cool hair and she's (5:46 - 5:51)
standing next to this giant computer let (5:48 - 5:53)
me talk to her and they were like do not (5:51 - 5:56)
talk to that woman get away from (5:53 - 5:58)
her they were like don't talk to that I (5:56 - 6:01)
was like okay so I didn't I didn't know (5:58 - 6:03)
anything about this this was not like on (6:01 - 6:04)
the Embargo they they didn't say (6:03 - 6:08)
anything about this um and I I don't (6:04 - 6:09)
want (6:08 - 6:13)
to this the I to be cynical for a second (6:09 - 6:17)
what's the point what that's not cynical (6:13 - 6:18)
that is a valid question what is the (6:17 - 6:21)
point it feels (6:18 - 6:25)
like they had a bigger idea and then (6:21 - 6:29)
they're like oh nothing works right uh (6:25 - 6:31)
we're that's how most of this game feels (6:29 - 6:34)
valid this one in particular where it's (6:31 - 6:37)
just like why like even one was anybody (6:34 - 6:40)
asking for it like I don't think so and (6:37 - 6:45)
two what does it do it just feels like a (6:40 - 6:48)
weird like even as Half Baked as most of (6:45 - 6:50)
the things they've done in this game (6:48 - 6:53)
this feels like a quarter (6:50 - 6:53)
baked yeah uh like it's just weird like (6:54 - 7:00)
usually want to do something in a game (6:59 - 7:04)
that gives you some sort of reward so (7:00 - 7:07)
like you you could I'm not AR I'm not (7:04 - 7:09)
saying that this is good but the reason (7:07 - 7:11)
you would want to like brush your (7:09 - 7:13)
Pokemon and then shampoo them which and (7:11 - 7:15)
rinse them off in the game is because it (7:13 - 7:17)
it does increase the happiness and that (7:15 - 7:20)
might be like your preferred way to (7:17 - 7:22)
increase the (7:20 - 7:22)
happiness so like is is this mode a (7:23 - 7:35)
faster way to get the snow runt snot or (7:28 - 7:39)
like Absol livers like is it faster to (7:35 - 7:41)
do that (7:39 - 7:44)
uh (7:41 - 7:47)
like what are we doing here yeah what (7:44 - 7:49)
what are we getting out of it like how (7:47 - 7:53)
far can we explore can I like it's only (7:49 - 7:55)
in the terarium right so you can only be (7:53 - 7:56)
a Pokemon in the terrarium so can I (7:55 - 7:58)
explore the whole terrarium if I am (7:56 - 8:01)
exploring what happens when like a shiny (7:58 - 8:05)
shows up um like like I'm sure those (8:01 - 8:07)
questions will be answered when we get (8:05 - 8:10)
it but I'm just curious here's the thing (8:07 - 8:11)
though there's like useless things in (8:10 - 8:13)
like all Pokemon games like there's a (8:11 - 8:15)
photography mode in sun and moon what (8:13 - 8:18)
did it do actually (8:15 - 8:20)
nothing like you had to like force (8:18 - 8:24)
tutorial it like there was like there (8:20 - 8:27)
was other things to do in like Ruby and (8:24 - 8:29)
Sapphire you had a contest contest gave (8:27 - 8:31)
you ribbons like there it it was like a (8:29 - 8:33)
deeper mechanic this doesn't seem very (8:31 - 8:35)
deep but like when it comes to like (8:33 - 8:38)
useless things like the photography mode (8:35 - 8:40)
I think being your favorite Pokemon is (8:38 - 8:43)
more interesting like if it like there (8:40 - 8:46)
is probably hopefully fingers crossed if (8:43 - 8:47)
I'm assuming this is going to be like (8:46 - 8:49)
semide decent there should be a (8:47 - 8:51)
difference between being a Pikachu and (8:49 - 8:55)
then being a jol TI a very very tiny (8:51 - 8:57)
Pokemon and being a Slowpoke a very very (8:55 - 8:58)
slow Pokemon and then like being a (8:57 - 9:04)
Rayquaza a Pokemon that can fly like (8:58 - 9:04)
ideally those four Pokemon I just named (9:05 - 9:11)
should feel different and that's kind of (9:07 - 9:15)
cool if they all feel different if let's (9:11 - 9:17)
remember the ekin (9:15 - 9:20)
animation well that was (9:17 - 9:22)
BDS I'm look yeah it's better in these (9:20 - 9:23)
games (9:22 - 9:27)
slightly I'm just saying let's let's (9:23 - 9:30)
tamper down our expectations and it says (9:27 - 9:32)
you can do that with other people so (9:30 - 9:35)
that's cool but again what what are we (9:32 - 9:36)
doing together right like if they're (9:35 - 9:38)
saying that this is like a way to get (9:36 - 9:41)
urb mystica or this is a way to get star (9:38 - 9:43)
pieces like even if it was like this is (9:41 - 9:45)
a way to get money faster I think some (9:43 - 9:47)
people would be like oh my gosh I don't (9:45 - 9:50)
have to like Auto Battle the Elite 4 or (9:47 - 9:52)
the CH the champ the Pala tournament (9:50 - 9:54)
over and over again like we have now I (9:52 - 9:56)
honestly I think just picking up items (9:54 - 9:58)
off the teal mask is a faster way to get (9:56 - 10:01)
money at this point (9:58 - 10:01)
like it can be cool and I hope it's cool (10:04 - 10:10)
but I feel like when you show a new (10:08 - 10:12)
feature and you're like you can be any (10:10 - 10:13)
Pokemon you want which they didn't say (10:12 - 10:16)
in this they did say in the Japanese (10:13 - 10:19)
like Q&A thing that you could be any (10:16 - 10:21)
Pokemon (10:19 - 10:24)
um I think a lot of people including us (10:21 - 10:27)
we just want to know why yeah I want to (10:24 - 10:30)
know why I mean it look cool it looks (10:27 - 10:33)
like a thing that that'll be fun for at (10:30 - 10:36)
least a few Pokemon and then you could (10:33 - 10:40)
be good kind of like ogre Aon was unless (10:36 - 10:42)
you went real hard and tried to get that (10:40 - 10:43)
final prize on (10:42 - 10:46)
it yeah well like ogre I sting you could (10:43 - 10:49)
be like well I want to beat my own score (10:46 - 10:50)
like there there is a there is like a (10:49 - 10:52)
score thing there and there is like a (10:50 - 10:54)
game that you can actually get better at (10:52 - 10:57)
I don't true know if you can get better (10:54 - 10:58)
[Music] (10:57 - 11:00)
at (10:58 - 11:02)
like they they could do a lot of cool (11:00 - 11:04)
stuff with it like what if you do bring (11:02 - 11:06)
like all the Eevee like what if four (11:04 - 11:07)
people bring four different Eevees is (11:06 - 11:09)
there like a little secret what if four (11:07 - 11:11)
people bring all the orac coros like (11:09 - 11:13)
like it they could add so many cool (11:11 - 11:15)
things to (11:13 - 11:18)
that I I don't think they would but no (11:15 - 11:20)
if I was like man I want to be pom pom (11:18 - 11:23)
and Greg is like I want to be Sensei and (11:20 - 11:26)
Hannah is like I want to be the Hawaii (11:23 - 11:26)
one (11:28 - 11:31)
I think there's a lot of potential here (11:30 - 11:34)
but based on the framework of scarlet (11:31 - 11:38)
and violet I I'm not holding my (11:34 - 11:42)
breath but maybe it's cool it's new it's (11:38 - 11:46)
a new thing so I that's a check (11:42 - 11:46)
box uh we'll just go through the press (11:47 - 11:52)
release and then we'll Circle back in (11:50 - 11:54)
what we missed the power of flight (11:52 - 11:56)
legendary Pokemon coridon and maridon (11:54 - 11:58)
will gain the power to fly for the first (11:56 - 11:59)
time when trainers take on the the Elite (11:58 - 12:03)
4 set by uh amaris wait how do we say (11:59 - 12:07)
her name Amma yeah amaris Amis uh of the (12:03 - 12:10)
BB League of the Elite 4 while this (12:07 - 12:12)
power is first to be believed to only be (12:10 - 12:14)
temporary it can apparently be made (12:12 - 12:16)
permanent I like how the press release (12:14 - 12:19)
say a can you're the you know you you (12:16 - 12:22)
know you press release person actually (12:19 - 12:23)
know what can (12:22 - 12:27)
happen allowing kidon maridon to fly at (12:23 - 12:29)
any time but only once players have made (12:27 - 12:30)
it far enough in their Adventure (12:29 - 12:32)
trainers will be able to fly wherever (12:30 - 12:33)
they please with their Legendary Pokémon (12:32 - 12:35)
and enjoy a sense of Freedom that only (12:33 - 12:38)
an open world can (12:35 - 12:42)
provide that's cool uh that's a good (12:38 - 12:45)
change I mean if we can fly (12:42 - 12:48)
everywhere not just in the terrarium but (12:45 - 12:50)
like we can fly everywhere I'm me if (12:48 - 12:52)
it's just you can fly in the terrarium (12:50 - 12:53)
and that's (12:52 - 12:56)
it fine I guess it depends on how big (12:53 - 12:59)
the terrarium is like how much of a (12:56 - 13:01)
benefit that actually is it sounds like (12:59 - 13:02)
you're going to be able to fly (13:01 - 13:03)
everywhere and it sounds like you're (13:02 - 13:05)
going to be able to fly over all of the (13:03 - 13:07)
tiny Pokemon that everyone would run (13:05 - 13:10)
into on accident otherwise (13:07 - 13:11)
1,000% this is why I would need to be (13:10 - 13:14)
able to fly (13:11 - 13:14)
everywhere here's the thing though (13:14 - 13:18)
here's the here's the actual secret to (13:16 - 13:21)
this game just never fly people all the (13:18 - 13:22)
time are like Steve how do you get so (13:21 - 13:25)
many shinies like you're you get so many (13:22 - 13:26)
shinies compared I literally just walk (13:25 - 13:29)
everywhere like if like if it's like I (13:26 - 13:31)
can fast travel to the auction or I can (13:29 - 13:34)
spend like 60 seconds walking just walk (13:31 - 13:35)
because you'll probably find a shiny (13:34 - 13:36)
along the way every time you fast travel (13:35 - 13:40)
you're just skipping 30 Pokemon (13:36 - 13:43)
[Laughter] (13:40 - 13:45)
blissfully that's like that's all like I (13:43 - 13:48)
I rarely use herb mystica in the game I (13:45 - 13:50)
just like oh I need to go to the auction (13:48 - 13:52)
it's like a two-minute walk I'll just (13:50 - 13:53)
walk and then like I find something (13:52 - 13:57)
along the way just I just just (13:53 - 14:00)
watch I rarely ever fast travel (13:57 - 14:03)
besides between teal mask and (14:00 - 14:04)
uh (14:03 - 14:09)
Pala KY that's what it's called I again (14:04 - 14:11)
this is another thing they can mess up (14:09 - 14:13)
I'm curious if they so they added more (14:11 - 14:17)
settings in the teal mask uh like (14:13 - 14:20)
whatever where you do like autosave and (14:17 - 14:22)
sound options they added more I don't (14:20 - 14:24)
remember exactly how much did they added (14:22 - 14:29)
more though um I hope there's a inverse (14:24 - 14:33)
toggle Mo inverted mode for flying (14:29 - 14:37)
yeah uh because and I also (14:33 - 14:40)
like gosh my biggest fear is there's not (14:37 - 14:42)
and it's like inverted for which is a (14:40 - 14:46)
monster way to play anything um and if (14:42 - 14:49)
like if there's no toggle for inverted (14:46 - 14:51)
can I just then turn it off because I (14:49 - 14:54)
don't I don't want to invert fly just (14:51 - 14:57)
I'll just (14:54 - 14:57)
Glide if you do it enough you'll get (14:57 - 15:01)
used to it (14:59 - 15:06)
mhm did I when you flew in the wormholes (15:01 - 15:07)
I know you could turn off motion control (15:06 - 15:10)
you had to do it you had to do it one (15:07 - 15:11)
time and then you could go into the (15:10 - 15:16)
settings and turn it off but that wasn't (15:11 - 15:16)
inverted and I don't think there was an (15:17 - 15:22)
option to invert (15:19 - 15:22)
it I thought I thought it was was it (15:24 - 15:29)
inverted I think it was new had to (15:27 - 15:32)
change it maybe I'm maybe I'm thinking (15:29 - 15:35)
wrong I I it's been a very long time (15:32 - 15:38)
trying imagine how I flew with my (15:35 - 15:42)
3DS well the I mean you had to like do (15:38 - 15:45)
the first (15:42 - 15:45)
one uh yeah I I get like there should be (15:48 - 15:53)
an invert there should be both there (15:51 - 15:54)
should be for people who like invert (15:53 - 15:56)
they should be able to have that on and (15:54 - 15:58)
for the rest of the sane World they (15:56 - 16:00)
should have (15:58 - 16:03)
that for Pilots you can keep it on (16:00 - 16:06)
invert because we need you to not mess (16:03 - 16:08)
up how you actually fly planes everybody (16:06 - 16:11)
else is should go to what you expect (16:08 - 16:14)
right right (16:11 - 16:14)
correct um again a good Fe I think this (16:16 - 16:23)
is a good feature I think uh (16:19 - 16:26)
maybe they should have bumped this one (16:23 - 16:29)
up to the teal mask like I I I to get (16:26 - 16:32)
the we want you to play our game we this (16:29 - 16:36)
is a very like MMO Trope sure is we want (16:32 - 16:37)
you (16:36 - 16:40)
to explore our world before you get to (16:37 - 16:42)
fly over it and then never walk again so (16:40 - 16:44)
like I get that that's like a very (16:42 - 16:46)
typical game mechanic of like we're (16:44 - 16:50)
gonna hide the actual flying post game (16:46 - 16:51)
or (16:50 - 16:54)
whatever I think in a perfect world (16:51 - 16:57)
maybe you you bump this up to the teal (16:54 - 17:02)
mask because this feature I think is a (16:57 - 17:05)
selling point for DLC mhm of like oh I I (17:02 - 17:07)
don't have to Glide anymore I can (17:05 - 17:11)
actually fly and I think it's a a I (17:07 - 17:12)
don't want to say like too little too (17:11 - 17:14)
late but I think that's like (17:12 - 17:18)
a better like is there any new mechanics (17:14 - 17:20)
in the teal (17:18 - 17:20)
mask the color of your Pokedex changes (17:24 - 17:31)
yeah true that's true I don't know if (17:28 - 17:32)
that's a good sell I mean I think it's (17:31 - 17:34)
cool that you could change your Pokedex (17:32 - 17:35)
I don't know if that's a selling point (17:34 - 17:38)
oh the new camera stuff the new camera (17:35 - 17:39)
Stu the camera the new camera stuff yeah (17:38 - 17:41)
yeah yeah you got to tell you could tell (17:39 - 17:43)
your Pokemon to hold still and stop (17:41 - 17:45)
running around in the (17:43 - 17:48)
background cease that incessant (17:45 - 17:51)
running and stay awake and stay awake (17:48 - 17:54)
we're taking pictures here they could (17:51 - 17:56)
also dance if you like change the song (17:54 - 17:59)
we need a good picture for the qu cards (17:56 - 18:02)
for Grandma if you could just sit still (17:59 - 18:07)
or Santa's not bringing you poke (18:02 - 18:07)
dollars (18:09 - 18:13)
[Laughter] (18:11 - 18:16)
sure uh (18:13 - 18:20)
BBQs let's talk about some BBQs (18:16 - 18:23)
now when th this was the one thing that (18:20 - 18:26)
was on the Embargo that I wasn't allowed (18:23 - 18:31)
to talk about was BBQs to be fair I I I (18:26 - 18:34)
had there there's two emotions I had so (18:31 - 18:36)
I'm like sitting in I'm sitting in the (18:34 - 18:39)
Uber in this hourlong Uber that Nintendo (18:36 - 18:43)
paid for to get from JFK to (18:39 - 18:45)
Midtown and they're like hey before (18:43 - 18:47)
tomorrow's appointment make sure you (18:45 - 18:50)
read over the Embargo sign it and on the (18:47 - 18:53)
Embargo it said don't talk about BBQs (18:50 - 18:56)
and that's all it said and I was like oh (18:53 - 18:59)
my gosh we're getting rid of the garbage (18:56 - 19:01)
sandwich mechanics we're going to be (18:59 - 19:03)
making hot dogs we're going to be (19:01 - 19:05)
grilling burgers like whatever they're (19:03 - 19:07)
doing with the sandwich the thrown away (19:05 - 19:09)
we're doing barbecues now that sounds (19:07 - 19:11)
awesome yeah that's not what that is (19:09 - 19:13)
that's not what that is it's blueberry (19:11 - 19:17)
quests which you know it's a good name (19:13 - 19:20)
it is the (19:17 - 19:24)
but blueberry is one word it's (19:20 - 19:27)
BQ there's no space between blue and (19:24 - 19:31)
Berry we don't capitalize the B inry for (19:27 - 19:35)
blueberry call them bqs they're (19:31 - 19:38)
bq's they're not (19:35 - 19:38)
BBQ's life at Blueberry Academy includes (19:39 - 19:44)
extracurricular activities called (19:42 - 19:47)
blueberry Quest or BBQs for short BBQs (19:44 - 19:48)
are assigned out to students by the (19:47 - 19:50)
school and by completing them you will (19:48 - 19:54)
earn blueberry points or BP a currency (19:50 - 19:57)
used at the Academy you I love how every (19:54 - 19:59)
game we get a new (19:57 - 20:02)
name for what a BP is beach points bang (19:59 - 20:05)
points I do like that I do like that (20:02 - 20:06)
they're very consistent with but okay (20:05 - 20:08)
but they're not consistent because (20:06 - 20:11)
keeping with their SK should be BP (20:08 - 20:16)
points BB bbp bbps it's Madness you can (20:11 - 20:20)
use you you can use BP in places such as (20:16 - 20:23)
the school store or the cafeteria but (20:20 - 20:25)
that's not all after joining the league (20:23 - 20:28)
club you can use BP to do things like ad (20:25 - 20:30)
feat to the club room which if we (20:28 - 20:33)
remember you could upgrade the dojo in (20:30 - 20:35)
the aisle of (20:33 - 20:39)
armor mostly that vending machine uh the (20:35 - 20:40)
vending machine is all anybody cared (20:39 - 20:42)
about (20:40 - 20:44)
I you can use BP to do things like ad (20:42 - 20:46)
features the club room or invite other (20:44 - 20:49)
trainers you know to the academy what's (20:46 - 20:50)
more you'll be able to take on group (20:49 - 20:53)
quests with friends uh which will task (20:50 - 20:55)
you with things for searching for ditto (20:53 - 20:57)
that has transformed into blocks and (20:55 - 20:59)
hidden themselves around the terrarium (20:57 - 21:00)
have fun with your friends as you (20:59 - 21:03)
overcome challenging missions together (21:00 - 21:06)
so we'll stop there for (21:03 - 21:06)
now there this is like I I don't think I (21:09 - 21:14)
have any problems with this I think this (21:13 - 21:16)
sounds great I think this is just (21:14 - 21:18)
another new like gameplay Loop that (21:16 - 21:21)
they've introduced uh I don't know if (21:18 - 21:25)
there's like an end to the BBQs or if (21:21 - 21:30)
they refresh every day or (21:25 - 21:30)
like how grindy it is like if if if you (21:31 - 21:36)
could only like earn like 1,000 points a (21:34 - 21:38)
day and you need like 2,000 points to (21:36 - 21:40)
invite a legendary which we'll get to (21:38 - 21:42)
that are people just going to like move (21:40 - 21:44)
their clock forward to then do another (21:42 - 21:46)
to (21:44 - 21:48)
another (21:46 - 21:51)
probably it kind of feels like when I (21:48 - 21:52)
actually zoomed in and looked at the (21:51 - 21:54)
quests it kind of feels like research (21:52 - 21:57)
tasks in Pokemon (21:54 - 21:59)
go (21:57 - 22:01)
yeah yeah one of the so if we just look (21:59 - 22:03)
at the quest line here it says um (22:01 - 22:04)
there's like a gold one that's worth 600 (22:03 - 22:07)
BP and it says catch the Pokemon that (22:04 - 22:09)
matches with the hints you were given (22:07 - 22:12)
and then it says for 20 BP successfully (22:09 - 22:14)
sneak up on one Pokemon and surprise (22:12 - 22:17)
them with a battle 30 BP trash slize (22:14 - 22:20)
your Pokemon and defeat a wild Pokemon (22:17 - 22:23)
and then 30 BP take a poke photo of a (22:20 - 22:25)
wild Pokemon while it's swimming so like (22:23 - 22:27)
that's cool and they have little symbols (22:25 - 22:29)
like here these are the ones you can (22:27 - 22:31)
battle the photo has like a little (22:29 - 22:33)
picture (22:31 - 22:35)
like I don't think anyone listening to (22:33 - 22:38)
the show would be like I don't want like (22:35 - 22:41)
side quest or mini task you like this is (22:38 - 22:43)
a cool feature like this is really (22:41 - 22:44)
really (22:43 - 22:46)
cool um especially if you can just grab (22:44 - 22:49)
a bunch and then just do them as you (22:46 - 22:52)
explore the (22:49 - 22:52)
world I think when you when you have an (22:52 - 22:57)
open world (22:55 - 23:01)
game there are usually I'm going to use (22:57 - 23:03)
Final Fantasy 14 as an (23:01 - 23:05)
example you log into the game and then (23:03 - 23:08)
normally you go well what are my daily (23:05 - 23:09)
quests what are my weekly quests I'm (23:08 - 23:11)
going to pick those all up and (23:09 - 23:13)
then without really thinking about them (23:11 - 23:16)
you just start doing them they (23:13 - 23:17)
eventually just get checked off and then (23:16 - 23:19)
usually near the end of the day or the (23:17 - 23:21)
end of the week you're like oh like I'm (23:19 - 23:23)
75% of the way there on this one let me (23:21 - 23:24)
just finish this real quick before I (23:23 - 23:27)
sign off for the day (23:24 - 23:30)
uh (23:27 - 23:33)
so good seems good uh the the bad thing (23:30 - 23:36)
here would be the economy like how (23:33 - 23:38)
expensive are things like why is this (23:36 - 23:40)
one 600 and this one (23:38 - 23:42)
30 (23:40 - 23:45)
and is like the base minimum (23:42 - 23:50)
of inviting jacqu to the terrarium like (23:45 - 23:52)
a (23:50 - 23:52)
thousand so uh that that would be my (23:52 - 23:58)
little worry is the the economy although (23:56 - 24:00)
Al though like I do for for all the the (23:58 - 24:03)
issues in scarlet and violet I do think (24:00 - 24:06)
the economy of that game is relatively (24:03 - 24:08)
good I (24:06 - 24:10)
think the the way you earn money the way (24:08 - 24:14)
you earn LP the cost of (24:10 - 24:16)
things what raids (24:14 - 24:20)
drop in terms of rewards I think I think (24:16 - 24:23)
the only thing that was like bad economy (24:20 - 24:26)
was the the Terra shards but (24:23 - 24:30)
like as a poke player that was like duh (24:26 - 24:32)
of course the new thing was going to be (24:30 - 24:35)
harder to get and of course the DLC (24:32 - 24:38)
would make it easier to get which it did (24:35 - 24:44)
yeah like that's just their their like (24:38 - 24:44)
cycle (24:44 - 24:47)
so I'm I'm I'm just very like the thing (24:48 - 24:53)
that stands out to me is take a photo of (24:51 - 24:54)
wild (24:53 - 24:56)
Pokemon like the battling stuff all (24:54 - 24:59)
seems like you figured that out that (24:56 - 25:02)
seems easy for that game to comprehend (24:59 - 25:05)
the taking the pictures seems like huh a (25:02 - 25:08)
little bit out outside of our Norm here (25:05 - 25:11)
I mean did that with the yeah with the (25:08 - 25:15)
quest in in teal mask you did yeah you (25:11 - 25:17)
did it what gosh I can't remember her (25:15 - 25:21)
name uh the Ursa the Ursa Luna (25:17 - 25:24)
Quest you did it with her but I felt (25:21 - 25:26)
like in that Quest you were you were not (25:24 - 25:28)
in the you were not technically in the (25:26 - 25:29)
open world that (25:28 - 25:33)
was kakami you were in like an instance (25:29 - 25:34)
of (25:33 - 25:37)
it that's true yeah like I couldn't (25:34 - 25:40)
throw out my Pokemon I couldn't open my (25:37 - 25:46)
menu uh it's parin I yeah and we haven't (25:40 - 25:49)
actually seen an equivalent uh Pearl (25:46 - 25:53)
descendant for this DLC which is (25:49 - 25:57)
curious yeah cuz she's like adaman based (25:53 - 26:00)
yeah yeah from (25:57 - 26:00)
Legends the the ditto stuff also (26:01 - 26:07)
cool where you'll have to like find the (26:05 - 26:10)
ditto obviously in everyone remembers (26:07 - 26:13)
aisle of armor where you had to find the (26:10 - 26:17)
Diglett which boy that was fun and then (26:13 - 26:19)
uh you had to like track down the the (26:17 - 26:22)
the the tracks in just a friendly (26:19 - 26:27)
reminder if you catch Tran calian and (26:22 - 26:29)
verian in (26:27 - 26:33)
the crown Tundra and then you talk to (26:29 - 26:35)
Sonia you can then catch a keio I just (26:33 - 26:37)
want to remind you all that kelio was in (26:35 - 26:39)
is in the (26:37 - 26:43)
game so is reg Reggie gigas Reggie gigas (26:39 - 26:45)
is also there yeah yeah yeah that's a (26:43 - 26:46)
little harder to get though because a (26:45 - 26:48)
little you got to get the reggies from (26:46 - 26:50)
the the Dynamax adventure and then you (26:48 - 26:53)
got to get the you got to trade over (26:50 - 26:57)
Reggie Drago um or (26:53 - 27:00)
Eli they're saying that like here's I (26:57 - 27:03)
feel I feel like there's like (27:00 - 27:06)
this every trailer up to this point or (27:03 - 27:09)
how they've talked about this game was (27:06 - 27:12)
very battle focused here's the Elite 4 (27:09 - 27:15)
everyone here is double (27:12 - 27:17)
battles obviously something going on (27:15 - 27:20)
with Kieran and Carmine that you got to (27:17 - 27:22)
battle them a lot too because that's (27:20 - 27:23)
what she did in the TS get a battle them (27:22 - 27:26)
like every four seconds that's fine uh (27:23 - 27:29)
this was like it feels like everything (27:26 - 27:32)
here is like here's a new thing yeah (27:29 - 27:34)
also you can do it with your friends (27:32 - 27:36)
here's another new thing also you could (27:34 - 27:39)
do with your friends like I felt like (27:36 - 27:40)
the teal mask didn't have any of that (27:39 - 27:42)
and again (27:40 - 27:47)
like the teal mask was maybe maybe some (27:42 - 27:51)
things were cut obviously (27:47 - 27:51)
delayed this DLC seems very very (27:52 - 27:58)
very packed with with stuff compared to (27:56 - 28:01)
the te mask this is definitely the grand (27:58 - 28:03)
finale of this game this feels like okay (28:01 - 28:06)
so we have a year to fill with this game (28:03 - 28:09)
so we're going to put all the things in (28:06 - 28:13)
uh and the big last final thing which I (28:09 - 28:16)
mean is appropriate like I feel like (28:13 - 28:18)
Crown Tundra is like now you can do (28:16 - 28:21)
Dynamax to the end of time trying to get (28:18 - 28:22)
all these legendaries and we'll add (28:21 - 28:25)
things into Dynamax like Ultra beasts (28:22 - 28:28)
Etc like I feel like both the (28:25 - 28:30)
philosophies to the second one is now (28:28 - 28:31)
we're going to just give you a ton of (28:30 - 28:34)
stuff to do to keep you in this game (28:31 - 28:36)
until the next one comes along like (28:34 - 28:38)
you'll you can't yell at us for not (28:36 - 28:41)
having something to (28:38 - 28:43)
do it does seem like there are going to (28:41 - 28:45)
be kind of a ton of things to do after (28:43 - 28:47)
this but we'll see how long they capture (28:45 - 28:50)
people for yeah I mean the question is (28:47 - 28:52)
like yeah I have stuff to do but is it (28:50 - 28:55)
worth doing that's always the balance (28:52 - 28:57)
that they sometimes sort of leave out (28:55 - 29:00)
like Dynamax Adventures were worth doing (28:57 - 29:02)
uh if you really like shiny hunting and (29:00 - 29:04)
shiny hunting legendaries it was well (29:02 - 29:06)
worth or just you needed to fill out (29:04 - 29:08)
legendaries that was worth doing (29:06 - 29:11)
but I actually think like even if you (29:08 - 29:13)
didn't need the Legends I thought (29:11 - 29:15)
Dynamax Adventure was fun yeah that was (29:13 - 29:16)
forced you well not well it did Force (29:15 - 29:18)
you it forced you to use Pokemon you (29:16 - 29:21)
would normally never use yeah I mean a (29:18 - 29:23)
lot of people were turned off by that (29:21 - 29:24)
like the same way as people were turned (29:23 - 29:27)
off by the rental ones in in all the (29:24 - 29:29)
battlef Frontiers when you had to go (29:27 - 29:30)
into the (29:29 - 29:33)
rental fights and you couldn't choose (29:30 - 29:35)
you had to like this is the pick pick (29:33 - 29:36)
the one you're starting with and add to (29:35 - 29:38)
your team and swap out like a lot of (29:36 - 29:40)
people just like well I don't want to (29:38 - 29:42)
learn these and that's how a lot of (29:40 - 29:44)
people feel about the raids in these (29:42 - 29:46)
games too it's just different parts of (29:44 - 29:48)
the games for different people but I (29:46 - 29:50)
know a lot of people enjoyed the Dynamax (29:48 - 29:53)
adventures and I'm really hoping that (29:50 - 29:56)
with the blueberry quests with the BBQs (29:53 - 29:58)
it gives you a big bonus B for (29:56 - 30:00)
completing things with other people (29:58 - 30:02)
because they were kind of highlighting (30:00 - 30:06)
playing together and co-op with the (30:02 - 30:09)
BBQs yeah so if if the BBQs were like (30:06 - 30:12)
you can only do 10 a day or (30:09 - 30:14)
something like do you get (30:12 - 30:17)
more is like that the way to get more is (30:14 - 30:19)
like oh you get way more points if you (30:17 - 30:21)
do it with a friend or like I can help (30:19 - 30:23)
my friend to do it and I can get 2,000 a (30:21 - 30:26)
day instead of 1,000 a day (30:23 - 30:29)
MH I don't know playing with other (30:26 - 30:31)
people in this game is real rough it's (30:29 - 30:33)
so much fun you know I I want to say (30:31 - 30:36)
like maybe it's better in the terrarium (30:33 - 30:38)
when I I'm not trying to be I'm trying (30:36 - 30:39)
to be optimistic here maybe it's better (30:38 - 30:40)
than the terrarium only because the (30:39 - 30:42)
terrarium is not as big as Pala like I (30:40 - 30:44)
know that for sure as somebody who's (30:42 - 30:45)
been in the terrarium already it's not (30:44 - 30:47)
as big as Pala I do think it's maybe the (30:45 - 30:49)
same size if not a little bit bigger (30:47 - 30:51)
than the teal mask but the teal mask I (30:49 - 30:55)
think is only like 1/4th the size of (30:51 - 30:56)
Pala (30:55 - 30:58)
it's obviously the teal mask is not (30:56 - 31:01)
bigger than pal either yeah I don't know (30:58 - 31:03)
I've never had any issues with Co-op (31:01 - 31:05)
maybe it's just because I've only done (31:03 - 31:07)
co-op with one other person at a (31:05 - 31:09)
time other than (31:07 - 31:14)
raids um have they have they not been on (31:09 - 31:18)
an invisible mount for you that happens (31:14 - 31:20)
a lot it it all went super smoothly (31:18 - 31:22)
every time I've done co-op with a (31:20 - 31:25)
friend I don't know but I also had my (31:22 - 31:27)
game in the last week uh freeze four (31:25 - 31:29)
five minutes every time I went to a (31:27 - 31:31)
loading screen (31:29 - 31:33)
so these games are (31:31 - 31:37)
different RNG and Pokemon (31:33 - 31:39)
R good old (31:37 - 31:43)
RNG well like I know you can you can (31:39 - 31:45)
like share herb mystica right like if (31:43 - 31:48)
I'm if if we if we both wanted to hunt (31:45 - 31:50)
Litwick and you didn't have any herb (31:48 - 31:51)
mystica I'd be like come on over Hannah (31:50 - 31:53)
we make put some bananas on I'll put (31:51 - 31:55)
some strawberries on okay now we both (31:53 - 31:58)
have sparkling power level three (31:55 - 32:01)
and it it's just a better gameplay (31:58 - 32:04)
experience for you then to leave my game (32:01 - 32:06)
uh because when I did try to shiny hunt (32:04 - 32:09)
with people in my own game which on (32:06 - 32:11)
paper that sounds like oh this should be (32:09 - 32:13)
fun like what happens if we both see the (32:11 - 32:15)
shiny like who gets to it first kind of (32:13 - 32:18)
thing you just because the game is (32:15 - 32:20)
trying to process two people you just (32:18 - 32:22)
get less (32:20 - 32:26)
spawns um and so like when I and then (32:22 - 32:28)
gosh forbid if it rains all of a sudden (32:26 - 32:30)
then and then everything's going on so (32:28 - 32:33)
it was like well we both want a shiny (32:30 - 32:34)
and we're both doing each other a (32:33 - 32:35)
disservice cuz we're both seeing (32:34 - 32:37)
significantly less Pokemon on screen so (32:35 - 32:39)
it's like just just go back to your own (32:37 - 32:42)
game and pick the same area and walk (32:39 - 32:44)
around and (32:42 - 32:48)
yeah so maybe this is better like maybe (32:44 - 32:50)
the terrarium is better with the co-op (32:48 - 32:53)
stuff you know surprisingly the co-op (32:50 - 32:55)
stuff does work it's just (32:53 - 32:58)
not optim I don't know like it works it (32:55 - 33:02)
just isn't I'm I'm immensely curious if (32:58 - 33:05)
the area zero stuff will still have it (33:02 - 33:08)
so that the other people don't show up (33:05 - 33:09)
unless you trick the game into making (33:08 - 33:12)
everybody (33:09 - 33:12)
appear Oh you mean like we start a party (33:13 - 33:17)
outside of area zero but then we walk (33:16 - 33:20)
into area zero together uh I mean if (33:17 - 33:23)
you're in area zero together uh and you (33:20 - 33:26)
all go by the same like if you're all in (33:23 - 33:27)
the exact same Rock and somebody calls a (33:26 - 33:30)
Pokemon over it will force everybody to (33:27 - 33:31)
appear in everybody's game because the (33:30 - 33:34)
game doesn't know how to Target so it (33:31 - 33:36)
forces so you can finally see everybody (33:34 - 33:39)
in area area zero still have no clue if (33:36 - 33:42)
that's a bug if that's a feature if (33:39 - 33:44)
that's how it's supposed to be but I (33:42 - 33:47)
mean people were like oh would would (33:44 - 33:49)
send me a tweet they like I fix it we we (33:47 - 33:51)
we're all in one area together and (33:49 - 33:53)
suddenly we all appeared I'm like yeah (33:51 - 33:55)
it's a known way around not seeing (33:53 - 34:00)
everybody in are areas zero but it's it (33:55 - 34:03)
doesn't always work and it's really hard (34:00 - 34:06)
to get everybody in the exact same spot (34:03 - 34:10)
for the game to force everybody to (34:06 - 34:13)
appear it's (34:10 - 34:13)
wild I think why the teal mask also (34:13 - 34:18)
seems (34:16 - 34:20)
like (34:18 - 34:23)
lackluster in retrospect is because it (34:20 - 34:26)
came out later than it should have mhm (34:23 - 34:29)
mhm like if if scarlet and violet drops (34:26 - 34:31)
in November and then the teal mask is (34:29 - 34:33)
supposed to come out in June which is (34:31 - 34:35)
what it should have came out like like (34:33 - 34:37)
there's no there's no denying that the (34:35 - 34:39)
the game based on a Japanese Summer (34:37 - 34:41)
Festival did not come out during the (34:39 - 34:43)
summer festivals in (34:41 - 34:46)
Japan like six months after it came out (34:43 - 34:47)
with like here's a little bit more story (34:46 - 34:50)
here's a couple new features that feels (34:47 - 34:52)
like oh okay that makes sense and then a (34:50 - 34:54)
full year later you're getting this (34:52 - 34:57)
bigger package yeah like all of that (34:54 - 34:59)
makes sense like even when you compare (34:57 - 35:02)
you know sun and moon to ultra Sun Ultra (34:59 - 35:04)
Moon they added a lot of stuff to that (35:02 - 35:05)
game that's why like I would always tell (35:04 - 35:07)
somebody to get Ultra over regular (35:05 - 35:10)
unless you only buy Pokemon games for (35:07 - 35:12)
the story (35:10 - 35:14)
which I encourage you to find other (35:12 - 35:15)
video games with other stories they out (35:14 - 35:19)
there I promise you but like (35:15 - 35:23)
like this one I of the story sun and (35:19 - 35:26)
moon is in the top but it's not as good (35:23 - 35:29)
as other area games that focus on it yes (35:26 - 35:32)
yeah yeah yeah but just like if you're (35:29 - 35:35)
spending $40 here $40 here everything is (35:32 - 35:38)
better in Ultra except the story except (35:35 - 35:39)
the story the story everything else is (35:38 - 35:41)
better you're just so many more things (35:39 - 35:43)
to do you get all the ultra wormholes (35:41 - 35:46)
you get uh the the they did their own (35:43 - 35:49)
photo thing in that game too you got you (35:46 - 35:51)
got totem stickers you got the manten (35:49 - 35:55)
surf you got the Zygarde stuff uh you (35:51 - 35:57)
got the battle tree upgrades like (35:55 - 36:00)
there's so much stuff (35:57 - 36:02)
anyways this DLC having all that stuff (36:00 - 36:05)
makes sense it's just because the teal (36:02 - 36:08)
mask was pushed and now is was like (36:05 - 36:10)
there's not even two months between (36:08 - 36:12)
these two dlc's and you're like well (36:10 - 36:14)
this one has like kind of (36:12 - 36:17)
nothing I mean it progresses the story (36:14 - 36:19)
but like feature-wise it it really (36:17 - 36:21)
doesn't have that much compared (36:19 - 36:25)
to what were what they showed off here (36:21 - 36:28)
which is not a complaint it's just (36:25 - 36:31)
like the timing is unfortunate and it (36:28 - 36:33)
makes because of the space it makes the (36:31 - 36:35)
one feel even worse than it (36:33 - 36:38)
is (36:35 - 36:38)
yes uh let's just talk about this real (36:38 - 36:42)
quick before we take a break two more (36:40 - 36:45)
things uh after you talk with your (36:42 - 36:46)
special coaches a few times they will (36:45 - 36:48)
offer to trade you a Pokemon I don't (36:46 - 36:51)
know why the word they use coaches G (36:48 - 36:52)
leaders they're Gym Leaders but do they (36:51 - 36:55)
come and Coach you about something like (36:52 - 36:57)
that's what it sounds like (36:55 - 36:58)
but (36:57 - 37:03)
what battling it's a very battle (36:58 - 37:05)
school I guess they're they're probably (37:03 - 37:07)
coaches here to like help you battle (37:05 - 37:10)
better I guess and for some reason the (37:07 - 37:13)
league of pdea has their Gym Leaders (37:10 - 37:15)
coming and helping with the school (37:13 - 37:17)
that's not in (37:15 - 37:20)
Pala this is a missed chance to be (37:17 - 37:23)
getting some of them Unova people over (37:20 - 37:24)
in as (37:23 - 37:26)
teachers the Pokemon they trade you will (37:24 - 37:28)
have a r ribbon appearing for the first (37:26 - 37:30)
time in the DLC for scarlet and violet (37:28 - 37:33)
it's the partner ribbon if you if uh you (37:30 - 37:35)
have a Pokemon wear this ribbon it will (37:33 - 37:37)
bestow a title containing the original (37:35 - 37:39)
name of the trainer that was (37:37 - 37:42)
displayed uh when sending into battle so (37:39 - 37:46)
the example they show is uh iono is (37:42 - 37:48)
there I'm assuming you're G to have to (37:46 - 37:50)
use BP to invite her like the previous (37:48 - 37:53)
segment said uh she trades you a (37:50 - 37:54)
Magnemite when you send it out in battle (37:53 - 37:57)
it says you uh it says like go (37:54 - 38:01)
iono Magnemite (37:57 - 38:01)
um the there was rumors that there was (38:01 - 38:09)
one new ribbon added to this DLC and (38:04 - 38:11)
obviously the the Pokemon ribbon (38:09 - 38:13)
community that that that is a thing that (38:11 - 38:16)
exists I'm part of it I'm sorry yep you (38:13 - 38:18)
sure are they they were very excited (38:16 - 38:19)
that there would be a new ribbon that (38:18 - 38:23)
they could get uh this is not probably (38:19 - 38:26)
what they wanted n cuz it cuz it sounds (38:23 - 38:28)
like it's only going to come from like (38:26 - 38:30)
Gym Leaders yeah it is neither an actual (38:28 - 38:33)
ribbon it's a mark and also or is it a (38:30 - 38:36)
ribbon I think it is a ribbon but like (38:33 - 38:38)
not anything you can earn yeah it's not (38:36 - 38:39)
something you can earn it's not (38:38 - 38:41)
something you can put on a ribbon Quest (38:39 - 38:44)
Pokemon (38:41 - 38:48)
yeah uh what's the last I mean like (38:44 - 38:49)
they've definitely had like (38:48 - 38:52)
distributions of like ma Piplup or (38:49 - 38:55)
whatever um or like ash Greninja but (38:52 - 38:57)
like the last time that was like in game (38:55 - 38:58)
that like you could go back to and (38:57 - 39:01)
access anytime I think is NS Pokemon in (38:58 - 39:06)
Black 2 White 2 yeah but he never gave (39:01 - 39:08)
them to you you like found them in the (39:06 - 39:11)
wild you found them in the (39:08 - 39:13)
wild I don't remember when you caught it (39:11 - 39:14)
it still said it was n's Pokemon right (39:13 - 39:16)
it didn't have (39:14 - 39:20)
your no it said it was NS (39:16 - 39:22)
yeah I feel like it there was an (39:20 - 39:24)
animation it did to signify that it was (39:22 - 39:26)
ends but it's been so long since like (39:24 - 39:29)
caught his Pokémon that I don't remember (39:26 - 39:31)
at all how that mechanic worked oh I (39:29 - 39:32)
don't know that I ever other than (39:31 - 39:36)
catching them I ever used them for (39:32 - 39:36)
anything uh the final thing here is (39:39 - 39:44)
throwing Styles if you donate BP to the (39:41 - 39:46)
blueberry Academy's baseball club you (39:44 - 39:48)
can change how you throw your pokeballs (39:46 - 39:50)
there are many throwing styles to learn (39:48 - 39:53)
for from find your favorite to spice up (39:50 - 39:57)
battles uh the last time this existed (39:53 - 40:00)
was Ultra Sun Ultra Moon I think I don't (39:57 - 40:02)
know if it was in base sun and moon but (40:00 - 40:05)
you would have to talk to the trash the (40:02 - 40:08)
trash man the trash (40:05 - 40:14)
man uh which was like was that second (40:08 - 40:16)
island I thought it was the third no (40:14 - 40:17)
third island third island because you (40:16 - 40:19)
had to do yeah because it's up around (40:17 - 40:23)
the it's around the cantonian fake gym (40:19 - 40:25)
in that City up on the bluff and then (40:23 - 40:28)
he's being like my kid's going to be a (40:25 - 40:29)
garbage holler just like me and the (40:28 - 40:33)
kids's like I don't want to yeah I'm not (40:29 - 40:35)
sure why they attached the throwing (40:33 - 40:38)
styles to the trash man this one makes a (40:35 - 40:39)
little more sense attaching it to the (40:38 - 40:41)
baseball (40:39 - 40:44)
club uh but this is cool now when you (40:41 - 40:47)
watch competitive VGC every weekend you (40:44 - 40:49)
can really discern the difference (40:47 - 40:52)
between the try hard players who just (40:49 - 40:54)
buy the game don't change their outfits (40:52 - 40:57)
don't do anything just uh somehow get (40:54 - 41:00)
these Pokemon over into their game uh (40:57 - 41:02)
versus the people who actually maybe did (41:00 - 41:04)
some of the (41:02 - 41:06)
story as a left-handed person I am (41:04 - 41:08)
grateful that they have the left-handed (41:06 - 41:10)
throw in there MH oh I didn't even (41:08 - 41:14)
notice that until you said it yeah so (41:10 - 41:15)
wait I know lot of people who are very (41:14 - 41:17)
excited about (41:15 - 41:21)
the uh left-handed (41:17 - 41:23)
thing is it only one left-handed though (41:21 - 41:26)
is everything else just probably right (41:23 - 41:28)
yeah which is unfortunate I would love (41:26 - 41:31)
to do any of the fancier throws (41:28 - 41:32)
left-handed but I don't think that's (41:31 - 41:35)
going to be an option you aot awkwardly (41:32 - 41:37)
throw left-handed in in one way in one (41:35 - 41:41)
way only and that is (41:37 - 41:41)
it how dare you be left-handed in our (41:41 - 41:47)
video game how (41:45 - 41:49)
dare do any of the gym leaders throw (41:47 - 41:53)
left-handed no they're right and proper (41:49 - 41:56)
not I want to pay attention to that now (41:53 - 41:58)
the only video game character I know is (41:56 - 42:01)
Left-Handed is Link in most games in (41:58 - 42:03)
most Zelda games (42:01 - 42:07)
most my immersion he was right handed in (42:03 - 42:07)
the one (42:07 - 42:09)
[Music] (42:07 - 42:13)
version okay uh I think the thile also (42:09 - 42:15)
cool like no complaints here I think (42:13 - 42:16)
it's cool I think it should just be (42:15 - 42:18)
default in every Pokemon game but you (42:16 - 42:20)
know what should also be default in (42:18 - 42:23)
every Pokemon game changing your outfit (42:20 - 42:24)
because I don't want to wear school (42:23 - 42:28)
uniform anymore jeez (42:24 - 42:31)
what that that would have been a look (42:28 - 42:32)
that's all they need to do in the teal (42:31 - 42:33)
mask all they need to do in the teal (42:32 - 42:35)
mask would have been like you could take (42:33 - 42:36)
your outfit off now I mean like (42:35 - 42:38)
somebody's be like you can like no I (42:36 - 42:41)
mean like actually have like hoodies (42:38 - 42:44)
shirts shorts pants (42:41 - 42:49)
not this literally anything else oh I (42:44 - 42:50)
have found a Reddit post about (42:49 - 42:54)

violet (43:55 - 43:59)
apparently if if Reddit is to be trusted (43:57 - 44:02)
and I have no reason why the in (43:59 - 44:05)
particular this Reddit post would be a (44:02 - 44:07)
lie can you imagine I'm going to just (44:05 - 44:09)
write down a bunch of characters to be (44:07 - 44:11)
left-handed I mean this person seems to (44:09 - 44:14)
have done their research again this is a (44:11 - 44:17)
YouTube comment go somebody go through (44:14 - 44:19)
and clip all the lefties for Hannah uh (44:17 - 44:21)
and then post them send them to Steve (44:19 - 44:22)

DM I I trust the the in-depth how many (44:22 - 44:28)
up votes they get I (44:26 - 44:32)
don't no the up vote count all right (44:28 - 44:33)
where do you see (44:32 - 44:36)
that Reddit I stopped using Reddit a (44:33 - 44:38)
while ago eight apparently oh eight (44:36 - 44:39)
people in the world cared about (44:38 - 44:42)
left-handed trainers I mean only 12 (44:39 - 44:43)
people looked at the thing according to (44:42 - 44:47)
this so of the 12 that looked at it (44:43 - 44:49)
eight of them were like (44:47 - 44:53)
yeah yeah this post has something going (44:49 - 44:53)

DLC don't worry just like sword and (45:14 - 45:18)
shield there will be a third DLC to (45:16 - 45:20)
complete the Pokedex they'll finally (45:18 - 45:22)
bring Beedrill to sword and shield that (45:20 - 45:27)
will that will sell copies I'm sure uh (45:22 - 45:29)
I don't want to talk about how mad I (45:27 - 45:31)
still am (45:29 - 45:34)
I look Anything could happen I guess (45:31 - 45:37)
maybe there could be a third DLC I just (45:34 - 45:39)
how do you how do you position a third (45:37 - 45:41)
DLC when this DLC is like the Legends (45:39 - 45:44)
are here now like usually when they do (45:41 - 45:46)
Legends it's like they're done yeah and (45:44 - 45:48)
this is really seeming like the grand (45:46 - 45:52)
finale to the story itself too y yeah (45:48 - 45:55)
yeah I mean look everyone says that har (45:52 - 45:57)
gold till silver and gold and silver are (45:55 - 45:59)
great because you get to go to two (45:57 - 46:01)
regions in this game you get to go to (45:59 - 46:03)
three so honestly I think this is (46:01 - 46:05)
probably the best Pokemon game they've (46:03 - 46:08)
ever made you get to go to Pala kakami (46:05 - 46:12)
and yova yeah no one's competing with (46:08 - 46:14)
that and you can have (46:12 - 46:17)
BBQ's that's (46:14 - 46:19)
true after completing the main story of (46:17 - 46:20)
the hidden treasure of area zero the (46:19 - 46:22)
Indigo disc trainers can meet a curious (46:20 - 46:25)
character named (46:22 - 46:25)
X and Y (46:26 - 46:33)
Mr the Mr feelings or whatever do you (46:28 - 46:36)
guys remember that dude the O (46:33 - 46:39)
power (46:36 - 46:41)
yeah yeah he just had a really weird (46:39 - 46:42)
name I can't remember what his it was (46:41 - 46:44)
something like (46:42 - 46:47)
that uh anyways snacks worth that it (46:44 - 46:48)
just the his snack the the the (46:47 - 46:51)
ridiculous name reminded me of the other (46:48 - 46:54)
ridiculous names they've used (46:51 - 46:54)
BBQs in the terrarium trainers can earn (46:56 - 47:01)
snacks from (46:58 - 47:01)
[Music] (47:12 - 47:20)
did what he said did what he said was (47:27 - 47:32)
doing you get to bond with your Pokemon (47:29 - 47:36)
more yeah true and you can see the (47:32 - 47:38)
origin of Mr bonding in Omega Ruby Alpha (47:36 - 47:40)
Sapphire which is like so weird of all (47:38 - 47:42)
the characters they decided to go back (47:40 - 47:45)
and give a huge origin to For No Good (47:42 - 47:48)
Reason like why great though huh they (47:45 - 47:51)
were pretty cool yeah I liked o Powers (47:48 - 47:53)
bring them back bring back o Powers get (47:51 - 47:55)
rid of BR to Pokemon go bring o powers (47:53 - 47:58)
to Pokemon go please and SpaceTime (47:55 - 48:01)
distortions the real tragedy in Pokemon (47:58 - 48:04)
wasn't the deck cut no no no it was that (48:01 - 48:08)
looker was cut looker has been in a lot (48:04 - 48:10)
but he has not been in this game or the (48:08 - 48:12)
last game now they're all stuck in (48:10 - 48:14)
Masters they all got sucked into the (48:12 - 48:16)
alra Wormhole that was the last game ler (48:14 - 48:16)
was (48:16 - 48:18)
in no he's in (48:16 - 48:22)
[Laughter] (48:18 - 48:25)
Masters yeah but is he in Pokemon (48:22 - 48:28)
Shuffle the the good game that's not a (48:25 - 48:30)
good game oh Shuffle was awesome what (48:28 - 48:33)
are you talking about so (48:30 - 48:36)
bad uh okay so there's there's a lot to (48:33 - 48:39)
unravel here with the legend stuff uh (48:36 - 48:42)
number one they they showed not every (48:39 - 48:46)
Legend uh they did not (48:42 - 48:49)
show the Gen 4 Legends well look no no (48:46 - 48:52)
one's really like losing any sleep over (48:49 - 48:54)
Mesprit as elf and (48:52 - 48:57)
ukie no no one's losing any sleep over (48:54 - 49:00)
those dare you I love okay the thing I (48:57 - 49:02)
saw on the internet was here's here's (49:00 - 49:04)
why I brought up like why maybe there (49:02 - 49:07)
will be a third DLC I don't think so but (49:04 - 49:08)
the thing that I saw on the internet was (49:07 - 49:10)
they didn't (49:08 - 49:12)
show the Callos (49:10 - 49:15)
Legends and look the callow people are (49:12 - 49:16)
desperate for anything at this point (49:15 - 49:19)
right like the the area on the map that (49:16 - 49:22)
existed the giant hole which they said (49:19 - 49:25)
was az's fault glamora being similar to (49:22 - 49:27)
the flower (49:25 - 49:28)
name a couple characters that have (49:27 - 49:31)
existed that like every Pokemon game (49:28 - 49:33)
brings up old regions like they're (49:31 - 49:34)
they're they're they're grasping for (49:33 - 49:36)
straws at this point their new straw (49:34 - 49:38)
that they're grasping is they didn't (49:36 - 49:41)
show xerus ye vatal and Zygarde they (49:38 - 49:44)
also didn't show Mesprit aelf and ukie (49:41 - 49:45)
okay (49:44 - 49:47)
like they also didn't show any of the (49:45 - 49:50)
ultra beasts you may have had like the (49:47 - 49:52)
world's smallest case if those were the (49:50 - 49:54)
literally only three Pokémon they didn't (49:52 - 49:56)
show there was a lot of Legends they did (49:54 - 50:00)
not show um yeah that being said they (49:56 - 50:02)
also didn't show Dian and Pia and then (50:00 - 50:05)
they were like by the way at the very (50:02 - 50:08)
end you can now catch a Dian Palkia in (50:05 - 50:13)
raids um I also saw a competitive person (50:08 - 50:16)
talk about how (50:13 - 50:21)
broken xerus and yov would be in (50:16 - 50:23)
tralization because of their (50:21 - 50:27)
abilities um if you don't know what they (50:23 - 50:31)
do dark Aura will increase all dark type (50:27 - 50:34)
attacks on the field by I think like 20 (50:31 - 50:38)
or 30% and then the same for Fairy AA C (50:34 - 50:41)
we already have a problem with flutter (50:38 - 50:44)
man in competitive Pokemon can you (50:41 - 50:46)
imagine a (50:44 - 50:50)
talized fairy flutter Bane with a xerus (50:46 - 50:53)
standing next to her yes like another (50:50 - 50:56)
this is the Universe I want to live in (50:53 - 50:58)
give me my big gay deer that ruins (50:56 - 51:00)
everybody's (50:58 - 51:01)
lives (51:00 - 51:04)
um it's interesting to think about of (51:01 - 51:06)
like oh maybe this is actually the (51:04 - 51:08)
reason why they're not here is because (51:06 - 51:12)
they're they they would possibly break (51:08 - 51:14)
and now somebody could be like well iif (51:12 - 51:17)
Fu already incin is already worse than Z (51:14 - 51:18)
like (51:17 - 51:24)
maybe sure maybe sure but uh yeah there (51:18 - 51:26)
there was a lot of Legends not show (51:24 - 51:30)
uh no clue if those Legends would come (51:26 - 51:32)
back or out I do want to here's here's (51:30 - 51:35)
the thing I want to say too because I (51:32 - 51:37)
I like a lot of people who listen to (51:35 - 51:39)
this show I'm chronically online we're (51:37 - 51:40)
all chronically online you're listening (51:39 - 51:42)
to a Pokemon podcast you were probably (51:40 - 51:43)
chronically online that's fine that's (51:42 - 51:45)
not an insult I am too I love the (51:43 - 51:48)
internet we all do and so if you read (51:45 - 51:51)
tweets or whatever that may or may not (51:48 - 51:53)
come from sources that just tweet (51:51 - 51:56)
everything possible you may have saw a (51:53 - 51:58)
tweet that only like 25 Pokemon are (51:56 - 52:00)
returning you also may have seen (51:58 - 52:03)
somebody who is very good at figurea (52:00 - 52:06)
shiny hunting her name is Anubis say (52:03 - 52:08)
there's not a lot like don't trust this (52:06 - 52:11)
tweet and literally we have now found (52:08 - 52:13)
out that whether or not there are like (52:11 - 52:16)
25 Pokemon returning they could just put (52:13 - 52:18)
any Pokemon in raids they did it was (52:16 - 52:20)
thean Palkia so like if your favorite (52:18 - 52:23)
legendary Pokemon maybe that's (52:20 - 52:25)
aelf they could literally just put it in (52:23 - 52:28)
rates but how how can you say there's (52:25 - 52:30)
only 25 Pokemon if we're getting all the (52:28 - 52:32)
starters there have literally been 25 (52:30 - 52:36)
Legends oh 25 Legends okay I'm like we (52:32 - 52:38)
know that's not true cuz they announced (52:36 - 52:40)
all the Legends and all of the starters (52:38 - 52:42)
that's more than 25 yeah yeah they said (52:40 - 52:44)
like I think the Tweet was like not all (52:42 - 52:47)
the Legends are coming back oh only 25 (52:44 - 52:49)
exist which may be true there's only (52:47 - 52:52)
like 25 spots on the Pala map cuz like (52:49 - 52:55)
when you watch the trailer you're like (52:52 - 52:58)
oh Ray qu appears here and xerus is here (52:55 - 53:00)
and Spectre is here and Cub fu is in the (52:58 - 53:02)
the bamboo (53:00 - 53:04)
forest the there is probably some (53:02 - 53:07)
validity to there's 25 spaces in Pala (53:04 - 53:09)
where Legends are going to appear but (53:07 - 53:10)
there are also a bunch of Legends they (53:09 - 53:14)
didn't show which two of them now exist (53:10 - 53:16)
in raids as we are talking about this (53:14 - 53:20)
show and who's to say xerus and neotel (53:16 - 53:22)
can't come back in raids right (53:20 - 53:24)
especially if they're controlling (53:22 - 53:26)
seasons of competitive if they're saying (53:24 - 53:29)
season if they're saying regulation (53:26 - 53:32)
e which which will allow Metagross it'll (53:29 - 53:35)
allow incinerar that'll last a couple (53:32 - 53:38)
months and guess what (53:35 - 53:41)
Z they can add xerus in regulation H or (53:38 - 53:42)
whatever right they could be like okay (53:41 - 53:45)
xerus is now in raids starting next (53:42 - 53:47)
month in regulation H you can use xerus (53:45 - 53:49)
like they can (53:47 - 53:51)
control what Pokemon go in and out of (53:49 - 53:53)
this game so again the only the reason (53:51 - 53:56)
I'm bringing this up is like one (53:53 - 53:57)
right right off the bat all the Legends (53:56 - 54:00)
are not coming back but two they've (53:57 - 54:01)
already given they've already shown us (54:00 - 54:04)
how they can bring Legends back through (54:01 - 54:09)
rid events um so again just we're all (54:04 - 54:11)
chronically online that's fine just just (54:09 - 54:12)
because somebody tweeted something and (54:11 - 54:14)
it got a bunch of retweets doesn't mean (54:12 - 54:16)
that person knows what they're talking (54:14 - 54:19)
about I (54:16 - 54:19)
mean they also aren't going to show (54:21 - 54:24)
everything in a trailer like if they're (54:23 - 54:26)
going to go through every legendary (54:24 - 54:28)
possible we're going to be there for (54:26 - 54:30)
seven years it's a teaser trailer (54:28 - 54:31)
they're going to pick the ones that are (54:30 - 54:34)
going to get people like oh (54:31 - 54:37)
hey I need that or I like that like (54:34 - 54:39)
they're gonna go off the top 10 list and (54:37 - 54:42)
make sure they're seen I mean yeah it (54:39 - 54:44)
was already a f minute trailer which is (54:42 - 54:46)
pushing people's attention spans as it (54:44 - 54:49)
is I man I actually thought it was like (54:46 - 54:50)
one of their best trailers they've ever (54:49 - 54:53)
done I thought great trailer yeah I also (54:50 - 54:56)
want to say like (54:53 - 54:57)
when Legends came (54:56 - 54:59)
out people were like oh I can't wait for (54:57 - 55:01)
the DLC like I wonder they're going to (54:59 - 55:03)
add back chariz or I think I I I was (55:01 - 55:04)
like if there is DLC they should (55:03 - 55:05)
probably add back Charizard right like (55:04 - 55:09)
Charizard would sell DLC um and there (55:05 - 55:11)
wasn't paid DLC for Legends which (55:09 - 55:13)
everyone thought was going to happen (55:11 - 55:14)
there was a free (55:13 - 55:16)
update uh and I don't want to get in the (55:14 - 55:18)
SE semantics of like what is considered (55:16 - 55:21)
DLC versus what's an update what's (55:18 - 55:23)
like there was no paid DLC like there (55:21 - 55:26)
was for sword and shield and Violet mhm (55:23 - 55:29)
um they they did add some stuff but it (55:26 - 55:32)
was just an update to the (55:29 - 55:36)
game they could update those Legends in (55:32 - 55:40)
kakami there's no reason (55:36 - 55:40)
why Mesprit azelf and ukie can't like (55:40 - 55:46)
roam kakami like as far as we know (55:43 - 55:49)
according to this press release all the (55:46 - 55:52)
Legends they showed kalian Teran (55:49 - 55:58)
Rayquaza Spectre they're all only in (55:52 - 56:02)
Pala so there what I'm saying is there's (55:58 - 56:03)
going to be a third DLC we're going back (56:02 - 56:05)
to Callos baby it's going to be great (56:03 - 56:09)
what I'm saying is they they could do a (56:05 - 56:11)
legend style (56:09 - 56:13)
update have it be free for (56:11 - 56:16)
everyone and then say like Hey we're (56:13 - 56:20)
adding some more Legends to kakami or (56:16 - 56:21)
the ultra Beast will actually be they (56:20 - 56:23)
didn't show any Ultra Beast what if the (56:21 - 56:25)
ultra Beast were in kakami like there (56:23 - 56:26)
are cool things they could do with like (56:25 - 56:29)
a free or small update but I (56:26 - 56:31)
don't I don't know what that looks like (56:29 - 56:33)
right like I don't you know again (56:31 - 56:34)
everyone thought we were going to pay (56:33 - 56:36)
get paid DLC for Legends and on Pokemon (56:34 - 56:40)
day they were just like here's a free (56:36 - 56:42)
update that adds like the smallest story (56:40 - 56:46)
in the entire world and like you can now (56:42 - 56:48)
like find a wild zor Arc in outbreaks (56:46 - 56:51)
like it was pretty tiny yeah not that (56:48 - 56:53)
I'm complaining because it was free if (56:51 - 56:54)
it was like five bucks I don't think (56:53 - 56:57)
that would have been worth it (56:54 - 56:57)
but also if they were like hey if you (56:57 - 57:01)
you want mesb as elf and ukie for $5 I'd (56:59 - 57:03)
be like I'd rather have (57:01 - 57:05)
the5 no I'm (57:03 - 57:08)
good I mean we just don't know what else (57:05 - 57:09)
they're going to add to raids we don't (57:08 - 57:11)
know what they're going to add to the (57:09 - 57:15)
other parts of the game (57:11 - 57:17)
like yeah they clearly want to keep this (57:15 - 57:19)
alive as a game they're going to keep (57:17 - 57:23)
doing raids so we'll see what happens (57:19 - 57:23)
there (57:24 - 57:29)
yeah they they they clearly like raids (57:26 - 57:31)
I for the mechanic (57:29 - 57:35)
thing of snacks worth (57:31 - 57:38)
um this is the thing that I'm (57:35 - 57:43)
like worried about mhm (57:38 - 57:46)
because you can get every Legend from (57:43 - 57:49)
gen one to Gen 4 in bdsp right if you (57:46 - 57:52)
want that as off ukie and M I got news (57:49 - 57:55)
for you they're in that game um but the (57:52 - 57:57)
problem that I had personally is I (57:55 - 58:00)
thought it was a bad way to get Legends (57:57 - 58:03)
I think the hallway simul simulator that (58:00 - 58:06)
was bdsp was not particularly great and (58:03 - 58:07)
that's why I'm a little bit worried (58:06 - 58:08)
about the (58:07 - 58:12)
Synchro thing or whatever because like (58:08 - 58:15)
when I say like what is this for I think (58:12 - 58:17)
of the same way as the underground it's (58:15 - 58:20)
like what is the underground for like to (58:17 - 58:23)
get sunstones to get moonstones to get (58:20 - 58:25)
like it's not a particularly fun way to (58:23 - 58:27)
get those stones when like in every (58:25 - 58:29)
other Pokemon game I could just walk (58:27 - 58:31)
into a store and buy them like I don't (58:29 - 58:34)
think it's fun to like run like crack a (58:31 - 58:35)
hole in the wall to get like a fire (58:34 - 58:37)
stone to finally evolve like my only (58:35 - 58:40)
fire Pokemon in the game (58:37 - 58:44)
uh like I I think if (58:40 - 58:45)
the gosh I can't remember the (58:44 - 58:49)
underground mini game had actual items (58:45 - 58:51)
that you would want like I don't know (58:49 - 58:55)
experience candy XL candy you would want (58:51 - 58:57)
want to do that more but then the other (58:55 - 58:59)
thing that they like they put the (58:57 - 59:02)
legendary shards or whatever in the (58:59 - 59:04)
walls and so you went out that when you (59:02 - 59:05)
went down there and you're like am I (59:04 - 59:07)
going to get a legendary Shard nope I'm (59:05 - 59:09)
just going to get another fir Stone cool (59:07 - 59:12)
like I have 40 firestones and I can (59:09 - 59:14)
summon one legendary Pokemon and then (59:12 - 59:17)
going to the park to just turn that on (59:14 - 59:20)
didn't feel no great I never did it I (59:17 - 59:24)
don't think I ever found enough (59:20 - 59:26)
legendary (59:24 - 59:27)
you were always fing firestones to do it (59:26 - 59:31)
and I was like I am so over this game by (59:27 - 59:33)
the time I got to that end game I was so (59:31 - 59:35)
done with that game and then it's like (59:33 - 59:40)
here's extra steps I'm like no if bdsb (59:35 - 59:42)
accomplishes the one thing that it set (59:40 - 59:45)
out to do which was to be an incredibly (59:42 - 59:47)
grindy Pokemon game everything about (59:45 - 59:49)
that game from leveling up to getting (59:47 - 59:51)
items to like training your Pokemon to (59:49 - 59:53)
like getting everything in that game was (59:51 - 59:55)
a grind and if that was what like that's (59:53 - 59:56)
how they should have advertised it (59:55 - 59:58)
honestly if they would have been like (59:56 - 60:01)
hey do you miss old Pokemon game games (59:58 - 60:03)
where you had to spend 40 hours to level (60:01 - 60:06)
up here we go you get to do it like I (60:03 - 60:08)
don't want to do that anymore I I I (60:06 - 60:10)
don't want to spend 40 hours level up I (60:08 - 60:11)
want to spend I want to do like three (60:10 - 60:13)
seven star raids with friends and then (60:11 - 60:16)
boom I got two level 100 Pokemon from (60:13 - 60:18)
that like 15 minutes I spent like that's (60:16 - 60:22)
that's what I want (60:18 - 60:25)
uh I don't need every Pokemon game to be (60:22 - 60:27)
the same like I don't need Ultra (60:25 - 60:28)
wormholes to come back I like Ultra (60:27 - 60:30)
wormholes thought they were super (60:28 - 60:32)
fun I I don't need Dynamax adventure to (60:30 - 60:34)
come back love Dynamax Adventure thought (60:32 - 60:37)
it was fun like continue to innovate (60:34 - 60:39)
continue to give me new ways to get (60:37 - 60:42)
Pokemon cool with that I don't know if (60:39 - 60:43)
just (60:42 - 60:46)
like giving snack worth like BP or (60:43 - 60:47)
whatever you're supposed to give him and (60:46 - 60:50)
then like going to a location finding (60:47 - 60:53)
it like is more interesting or more fun (60:50 - 60:54)
than like Dynamax adventure maybe some (60:53 - 60:55)
people people will be like I hate (60:54 - 60:56)
Dynamax Adventure just give me the (60:55 - 61:00)
legendary cool like I get that um I'm (60:56 - 61:03)
just curious of like what is involved (61:00 - 61:06)
here um that isn't like you're going to (61:03 - 61:09)
do the same thing 25 (61:06 - 61:11)
times and just you just have to have (61:09 - 61:14)
enough materials for 25 encounters (61:11 - 61:16)
assuming that there's 25 encounters (61:14 - 61:18)
we're just I didn't count exactly how (61:16 - 61:20)
many legendary showed up in that (61:18 - 61:22)
trailer yeah it seems like a lot is (61:20 - 61:25)
hanging on how interesting being BBQ's (61:22 - 61:28)
actually are how varied they are how (61:25 - 61:30)
quick they can go how quickly you can (61:28 - 61:35)
save up to encounter a single legendary (61:30 - 61:37)
yep here's a question for the two of you (61:35 - 61:41)
you're invited to a BBQ what are you (61:37 - 61:44)
bringing (61:41 - 61:44)
Sprite berries I don't (61:45 - 61:52)
know I think for me if if I was to like (61:48 - 61:54)
if they were like you need to bring food (61:52 - 61:56)
I would probably bring mad macaroni okay (61:54 - 61:58)
but I feel like that's what every like (61:56 - 62:00)
macaroni and cheese or like a macaroni (61:58 - 62:03)
salad no just the noodles uncooked no (62:00 - 62:06)
yeah macaroni and cheese but how are you (62:03 - 62:08)
keeping that (62:06 - 62:12)
warm you bring a you bring in a crockpot (62:08 - 62:15)
okay so the barbecue is in somebody's (62:12 - 62:20)
backyard yeah they have outlets (62:15 - 62:20)
right I'm not putting those restrictions (62:20 - 62:23)
on or off (62:22 - 62:26)
this you bring it a (62:23 - 62:29)
Crockpot they sell Pokemon crockpot over (62:26 - 62:32)
at box lunch if you're interest put it (62:29 - 62:34)
in there watch the sticker that they (62:32 - 62:36)
slapped on that poor crockpot peel off (62:34 - 62:38)
after two (62:36 - 62:38)
uses (62:38 - 62:45)
uh just just a side of note every single (62:41 - 62:46)
YouTuber in the universe is going to (62:45 - 62:48)
make a YouTube video as fast as possible (62:46 - 62:51)
of all locations of all these legendary (62:48 - 62:54)
Pokemon oh 100 put there I got you I'll (62:51 - 62:56)
make aex list so you don't have to watch (62:54 - 62:58)
any of (62:56 - 63:01)
them I'll just here it is on the map I'm (62:58 - 63:03)
just going to go to what who always IGN (63:01 - 63:05)
always has Bizarro lists like that about (63:03 - 63:08)
two seconds after the game is launched I (63:05 - 63:09)
don't know how these people oh I guess I (63:08 - 63:10)
do know how these people well usually (63:09 - 63:13)
with the there was a way to get Scarlet (63:10 - 63:16)
Violet very early if you went to a manpa (63:13 - 63:18)
store I don't think there's any way (63:16 - 63:19)
there's no way to get this DLC early (63:18 - 63:22)
it's it's restricted so it'll be a big r (63:19 - 63:23)
that was I only say that because I (63:22 - 63:26)
remember when Isle of armor came out and (63:23 - 63:28)
every YouTube like even if you weren't a (63:26 - 63:30)
YouTuber you're like default was like I (63:28 - 63:34)
need to make a video on every Diglett (63:30 - 63:36)
location like that was that was like the (63:34 - 63:38)
go-to like there (63:36 - 63:41)
are like makeup bloggers out there like (63:38 - 63:42)
I gotta do the Diglett thing everyone (63:41 - 63:43)
else is doing (63:42 - 63:46)
it I still have never finished finding (63:43 - 63:49)
all the digletts then you never got the (63:46 - 63:53)
6 I perfect Diglett I didn't and you (63:49 - 63:55)
know what my life is (63:53 - 63:58)
fine good maybe that's why it took you (63:55 - 64:00)
so long to get a job Greg cuz you didn't (63:58 - 64:03)
have on your LinkedIn profile I got all (64:00 - 64:05)
the diglet that's what an employer is (64:03 - 64:09)
looking for I had a lot on my I had a (64:05 - 64:12)
lot on my resume and on my LinkedIn and (64:09 - 64:15)
I will note listener when I was looking (64:12 - 64:18)
around and making connections I happened (64:15 - 64:20)
to look at one Steve serum's LinkedIn (64:18 - 64:23)
profile and I immediately got a message (64:20 - 64:24)
why are you looking at my LinkedIn (64:23 - 64:26)
profile all (64:24 - 64:28)
accusatory (64:26 - 64:32)
like I'm sorry I spend my life on this (64:28 - 64:34)
dumb social media site now looking (64:32 - 64:38)
around I take one (64:34 - 64:41)
Peak to see if there's connections I can (64:38 - 64:46)
snipe and I get a nasty gram two minutes (64:41 - 64:49)
after for whatever reason when you (64:46 - 64:51)
looked at my profile LinkedIn decided to (64:49 - 64:56)
email me that you looked at my profile (64:51 - 64:59)
that's the only reason I knew is they (64:56 - 65:02)
emailed me they're like Greg Leatherman (64:59 - 65:04)
is looking at your profile and I was (65:02 - 65:05)
like (65:04 - 65:10)
what then I I doing a natural thing (65:05 - 65:12)
naturally looking to see what (65:10 - 65:14)
connections I might be able to find (65:12 - 65:15)
because it's the only way you can find a (65:14 - 65:20)
job and I get I get a hate mail from my (65:15 - 65:22)
supposed friend and (65:20 - 65:27)
co-host and I F Yi listeners he doesn't (65:22 - 65:29)
have a single shiny listed in there (65:27 - 65:31)
anywhere I am it's (65:29 - 65:35)
true ly he's been lying for years don't (65:31 - 65:39)
spoil the illusion of my LinkedIn (65:35 - 65:42)
um uh we we we already talked about this (65:39 - 65:45)
they put Diga and palia into five star (65:42 - 65:48)
raids they are not seven star raids (65:45 - 65:51)
um i i people are struggling with this (65:48 - 65:53)
and I know there are probably people (65:51 - 65:54)
listening to this being like it was easy (65:53 - 65:57)
for me not everyone is good at raids (65:54 - 66:00)
it's fine I've accepted this the like (65:57 - 66:03)
the funniest thing is like when I go to (66:00 - 66:04)
my Twitter my YouTube comments it's (66:03 - 66:07)
always like this was the easiest raid (66:04 - 66:09)
ever and then the comment below that was (66:07 - 66:14)
like I can't do so like I made a video (66:09 - 66:15)
about that that's on that's on YouTube (66:14 - 66:18)
if you're struggling I I've made a video (66:15 - 66:19)
about what Pokemon you can use you (66:18 - 66:21)
probably already have a Pokemon that you (66:19 - 66:23)
can just use you just have to literally (66:21 - 66:25)
change two moves so I I did a YouTube (66:23 - 66:26)
video for that uh they did five star (66:25 - 66:30)
raids instead of seven star just a fun (66:26 - 66:32)
fact uh there's a lot of fun facts this (66:30 - 66:35)
episode a five star raate is level 75 a (66:32 - 66:38)
six-star rate is level 90 which is (66:35 - 66:40)
deceiving because when you catch it it's (66:38 - 66:42)
not level 90 but when you're battling it (66:40 - 66:43)
it (66:42 - 66:45)
is they just don't tell you raid levels (66:43 - 66:48)
at all which you know might be helpful (66:45 - 66:51)
to the average Pokemon player but they (66:48 - 66:54)
don't tell you raid levels level five is (66:51 - 66:58)
75 level six is 90 a level seven is (66:54 - 67:00)
100 they have really good like if these (66:58 - 67:01)
were level (67:00 - 67:04)
100 they have really good move sets and (67:01 - 67:07)
really good coverage uh like the only (67:04 - 67:10)
thing that's really quote unquote making (67:07 - 67:12)
them easy is you're bringing a level 100 (67:10 - 67:15)
and they level 75 right like yeah like (67:12 - 67:17)
if they if (67:15 - 67:20)
if they were (67:17 - 67:23)
stronger levelwise they could do more (67:20 - 67:26)
damage and potenti put pressure on (67:23 - 67:28)
but I don't have a problem with this I (67:26 - 67:30)
think that's fine of like they just want (67:28 - 67:33)
you to catch a Diga and a Pia and I (67:30 - 67:36)
think palia is in Violet and Diaga is in (67:33 - 67:38)
Scarlet so in order to get both you'll (67:36 - 67:40)
have to connect to the internet and join (67:38 - 67:42)
somebody else's (67:40 - 67:46)
which I'm going to go out on a limb and (67:42 - 67:47)
say that this is not the last time (67:46 - 67:49)
they'll put two legendaries in separate (67:47 - 67:51)
games and you'll have to do a Raid (67:49 - 67:53)
Battle for them I'm probably probably (67:51 - 67:56)
safe to say (67:53 - 67:56)
my toughest part of these raids was (67:56 - 68:01)
actually getting into (67:59 - 68:05)
one yeah (68:01 - 68:05)
I W like I at one point I'm pretty sure (68:06 - 68:18)
I was just clicking join for 15 solid (68:12 - 68:21)
minutes before I could get into a raid (68:18 - 68:22)
which I was (68:21 - 68:25)
like y'all (68:22 - 68:26)
better know what you're doing because I (68:25 - 68:28)
just waited 15 minutes to get into this (68:26 - 68:31)
raid and if you mess this (68:28 - 68:35)
up I I I I I'm glad you said that (68:31 - 68:39)
because just based off one statistic so (68:35 - 68:41)
take it take this for what it's (68:39 - 68:45)
worth my Dian palia video has done (68:41 - 68:47)
almost triple the amount of views as my (68:45 - 68:50)
seven star Eevee video and that was out (68:47 - 68:52)
well before the sevenstar Eevee raid I (68:50 - 68:53)
just think that people love legendary (68:52 - 68:56)
Pok and they're significantly more (68:53 - 68:59)
interested yeah in Diga and Pia (68:56 - 69:01)
regardless of how hard or easy they are (68:59 - 69:03)
compared (69:01 - 69:07)
to Eevee and just based off like YouTube (69:03 - 69:09)
views alone (69:07 - 69:12)
Greninja up like Greninja the best seven (69:09 - 69:15)
star that wasn't a legendary and then (69:12 - 69:18)
obviously Mewtwo like Mewtwo by far (69:15 - 69:20)
better than but also people were like I (69:18 - 69:22)
legit need help for me (69:20 - 69:25)
too but I I just think like the reason (69:22 - 69:27)
you probably struggled is because so (69:25 - 69:28)
many people just like I want I want a (69:27 - 69:31)
legendary Pokemon which (69:28 - 69:34)
is not surprising in the marketing (69:31 - 69:36)
scheme of things of like we're going to (69:34 - 69:38)
put legendary Pokemon in DLC and then (69:36 - 69:39)
you're going to spend $30 to get DLC (69:38 - 69:41)
because you want also they did this with (69:39 - 69:44)
starter Pokemon like it's yep I I had (69:41 - 69:46)
get them in luxury balls I was like I'm (69:44 - 69:48)
gonna go get these things for like my 8 (69:46 - 69:51)
millionth time so I can have them for (69:48 - 69:54)
sure in luxury balls that is my only end (69:51 - 69:55)
goal (69:54 - 69:57)
here uh yeah people people like (69:55 - 69:59)
legendary (69:57 - 70:01)
Pokemon um they also announced another (69:59 - 70:05)
they they Pokemon was like hey you got (70:01 - 70:07)
stuff to do this weekend no you don't (70:05 - 70:10)
you're GNA be playing Pokemon this (70:07 - 70:13)
weekend uh they also announced a new (70:10 - 70:14)
Mass outbreak event this is the third (70:13 - 70:16)
Mass outbreak they've done but instead (70:14 - 70:20)
of boosting the mark chance they have (70:16 - 70:23)
boosted the shiny chance which is one (70:20 - 70:25)
year later (70:23 - 70:27)
uh they this (70:25 - 70:31)
is TE technically our first shiny event (70:27 - 70:32)
I mean you could maybe (70:31 - 70:36)
say gimme (70:32 - 70:36)
ghoul that was mostly disappointing (70:36 - 70:43)
yeah (70:41 - 70:45)
uh they to celebrate the Indigo disc (70:43 - 70:47)
Mass outbreak event they're featuring (70:45 - 70:48)
different Pokemon in the pal region (70:47 - 70:50)
Landa kakami and terrarium at the (70:48 - 70:52)
blueberry Academy it seems chining (70:50 - 70:53)
Pokémon are more likely to appear in (70:52 - 70:56)
these M Mass outbreaks uh Pala will (70:53 - 70:57)
feature (70:56 - 71:00)
flbe all five uh the flowers do rotate (70:57 - 71:02)
every day they they do show up on the (71:00 - 71:05)
map as the the proper color uh kakami (71:02 - 71:07)
will feature (71:05 - 71:10)
Litwick and the blueberry Academy which (71:07 - 71:11)
you cannot access right now as of (71:10 - 71:13)
listening to this episode you gota wait (71:11 - 71:15)
till the 14th uh we'll have (71:13 - 71:17)
Miler uh we have no clue how to evolve (71:15 - 71:20)
Miler yet well I'm assuming you can spin (71:17 - 71:24)
in the game but the the items we don't (71:20 - 71:26)
know how to get those (71:24 - 71:29)
yet (71:26 - 71:32)
um Anubis said that it was a (71:29 - 71:37)
0.5% chance to be shiny so that's a one (71:32 - 71:38)
in 200 (71:37 - 71:40)
chance the game is really weird in how (71:38 - 71:42)
that works (71:40 - 71:46)
so when you first encounter the Pokemon (71:42 - 71:48)
that's the one in 200 if it fails to be (71:46 - 71:52)
shiny then it will roll your normal (71:48 - 71:55)
stuff so that's why I posted a graphic (71:52 - 71:56)
about this that's why when you see it it (71:55 - 71:58)
doesn't say one in 200 it says like one (71:56 - 72:00)
in 191 because you have to like do the (71:58 - 72:02)
first roll and then the second roll (72:00 - 72:04)
they're like they don't stack together (72:02 - 72:06)
there it's just two rolls um but I guess (72:04 - 72:07)
technically that's how shiny hunting (72:06 - 72:10)
works anyways like a shiny charm (72:07 - 72:14)
is plus two like it's just rolling it (72:10 - 72:17)
twice like it's fine it's fine what this (72:14 - 72:20)
means is it's just relatively easier to (72:17 - 72:22)
get a Shiny Pokemon so if you want (72:20 - 72:24)
Litwick you'll have to catch three of (72:22 - 72:25)
them if you want the whole line they do (72:24 - 72:26)
have (72:25 - 72:29)
momento um so you can bring a Pokemon (72:26 - 72:31)
that you should bring a Pokemon that has (72:29 - 72:34)
taunt uh but you could just bring golden (72:31 - 72:36)
go because you can't momento good as (72:34 - 72:40)
gold uh and litwicks catch rate is 35 so (72:36 - 72:41)
if you want to do absolutely no work and (72:40 - 72:43)
you want to be lazy like me just bring (72:41 - 72:45)
golden go and just Chuck pokeballs at it (72:43 - 72:48)
it's catch rate is super good can't do (72:45 - 72:52)
anything else uh although it should be (72:48 - 72:54)
100% with a quick Ball but again if you (72:52 - 72:57)
want not a quick ball golden go or a (72:54 - 73:02)
taunter is your best bet on that FL (72:57 - 73:04)
there's five versions of it the white is (73:02 - 73:05)
the rare (73:04 - 73:07)
one uh so if you want the whole line you (73:05 - 73:09)
would need 15 (73:07 - 73:11)
fbe and then (73:09 - 73:16)
milser oh boy milser is complicated (73:11 - 73:16)
there's there's uh there's a lot there's (73:18 - 73:23)
a lot I believe there are seven (73:21 - 73:26)
different types of sweets but there's (73:23 - 73:30)
nine different mseries so those two (73:26 - 73:32)
together are 63 mseries (73:30 - 73:35)
total which I'm very proud that I have (73:32 - 73:38)
all of them that was one of my big tasks (73:35 - 73:39)
my big tasks in sword and shield was to (73:38 - 73:42)
get all of them how the shiny works is (73:39 - 73:45)
weird the shiny is always black no (73:42 - 73:47)
matter what flavor you have so if you (73:45 - 73:48)
have like strawberry swirl or caramel (73:47 - 73:50)
swirl or rainbow sherbet it's always (73:48 - 73:52)
going to be black the only difference is (73:50 - 73:55)
the sweet so Tech (73:52 - 73:58)
technically there are seven shiny milser (73:55 - 74:00)
because there are seven sweets so in (73:58 - 74:03)
total there are 70 mils series because (74:00 - 74:06)
63 are non shiny and then seven are (74:03 - 74:09)
shiny (74:06 - 74:12)
but there but they still would like the (74:09 - 74:15)
shiny still would be a the flavor you (74:12 - 74:18)
decided to mix so you could have like a (74:15 - 74:19)
strawberry (74:18 - 74:23)
sweet shiny mser and then a like caramel (74:19 - 74:25)
straw Berry shiny milser but they would (74:23 - 74:28)
they would literally be the same the (74:25 - 74:30)
only way you would know they would be (74:28 - 74:32)
different would be Pokemon home on the (74:30 - 74:34)
mobile version because the switch (74:32 - 74:36)
version wouldn't tell you they're (74:34 - 74:38)
different (74:36 - 74:41)
so I guess if you're a (74:38 - 74:44)
completionist you would get 63 shinies (74:41 - 74:46)
but you you wouldn't be able to tell (74:44 - 74:50)
ever cuz the only thing that you can see (74:46 - 74:51)
is different is the site and there's (74:50 - 74:55)
only seven sweets so I don't know keep (74:51 - 74:56)
you do you in that instance if you want (74:55 - 75:01)
to get six I would be impressed (74:56 - 75:01)
um (75:01 - 75:07)
but yeah uh so 63 (75:04 - 75:10)
Miler plus the seven shiny if you want (75:07 - 75:13)
to do that when the DLC comes out which (75:10 - 75:15)
I think is both like (75:13 - 75:18)
cool and also bad at the same I'm like I (75:15 - 75:20)
want to get the milser But I want to do (75:18 - 75:22)
the DLC you're only giving me a week for (75:20 - 75:26)
the milser I don't know it's (75:22 - 75:28)
fine it's cool that they they did a (75:26 - 75:30)
shiny event it's cool that all three (75:28 - 75:32)
areas have different Pokemon that you (75:30 - 75:34)
can get I think this is a really this if (75:32 - 75:37)
anything is a compelling selling point (75:34 - 75:40)
of getting the DLC is like these (75:37 - 75:44)
events um I don't know it's always like (75:40 - 75:46)
you always like hear people talk about (75:44 - 75:48)
how there's no post game and Scarlet and (75:46 - 75:49)
violet and I can kind of see what (75:48 - 75:52)
they're saying but (75:49 - 75:54)
like (75:52 - 75:55)
if you don't like shiny hunting and you (75:54 - 75:57)
don't like (75:55 - 76:00)
battling and you finish catching all the (75:57 - 76:03)
Pokemon what what else do you want a (76:00 - 76:05)
battle tower I guess it's like more (76:03 - 76:07)
battling but also speaking of battle (76:05 - 76:10)
tower they didn't show a battle tower (76:07 - 76:14)
here this this one it's a battle (76:10 - 76:16)
Bush so I don't know if there is a (76:14 - 76:18)
battle tower usually they they talk (76:16 - 76:21)
about that I remember very distinctively (76:18 - 76:22)
them talking about the Battle tree and (76:21 - 76:25)
Ultra Sun Ultra Moon (76:22 - 76:25)
and I can confirm there are no Towers in (76:26 - 76:31)
the dome as somebody who has explored (76:29 - 76:33)
the Dome there's no secret hidden towers (76:31 - 76:34)
that they're not showing you in the it (76:33 - 76:36)
was in the (76:34 - 76:39)
basement yeah oh the battle Subway the (76:36 - 76:41)
battle Subway oh and then the subway (76:39 - 76:43)
Under the Dome takes you back to Unova (76:41 - 76:47)
cuz it goes under the water uhhuh where (76:43 - 76:49)
does c come in Greg I know we take the (76:47 - 76:52)
battle Subway too okay do you not know (76:49 - 76:54)
of the English Underground channel that (76:52 - 76:56)
connects England and France by a giant (76:54 - 76:59)
underwater tunnel so of course the (76:56 - 77:01)
blueberry Academy is on top of that and (76:59 - 77:03)
it takes you down to that tunnel so you (77:01 - 77:07)
can go south to France or north to (77:03 - 77:09)
England which means you go south to (77:07 - 77:12)
Kalos or North the Galler whatever (77:09 - 77:13)
directions they are like I don't know (77:12 - 77:16)
there's a tunnel but blueberry Academy (77:13 - 77:19)
is yova okay they're all in they're all (77:16 - 77:21)
they're all twined together come on (77:19 - 77:24)
catch up catch up the network of trins (77:21 - 77:28)
underwater is is vast and (77:24 - 77:28)
far um yeah I I I like you you have (77:31 - 77:37)
shiny hunting you have battles you have (77:36 - 77:42)
seven star raids uh I don't I I feel (77:37 - 77:47)
like besides like a battle (77:42 - 77:49)
tower you don't have contests like I (77:47 - 77:51)
don't what what what people want to post (77:49 - 77:53)
game I don't know if you're watching on (77:51 - 77:55)
YouTube and you're upset about the the (77:53 - 77:57)
postgame stuff what what do you want (77:55 - 78:00)
yeah I I I assume the most popular (77:57 - 78:03)
answer would be like Battlefront tier (78:00 - 78:06)
but or or something of the sort but I (78:03 - 78:08)
don't know that (78:06 - 78:08)
never I don't know I I guess I guess for (78:09 - 78:13)
me I just never got a thrill out of (78:11 - 78:15)
battling NPCs like even when I went (78:13 - 78:19)
through the the stuff for sword and (78:15 - 78:21)
shield or for Sun and Moon I was just (78:19 - 78:24)
like I mean this is the battle focused (78:21 - 78:26)
school and we know they have a (78:24 - 78:29)
huge uh area for battling so there's (78:26 - 78:32)
still very possibly something there (78:29 - 78:34)
where there are hard battles that you (78:32 - 78:36)
can just keep (78:34 - 78:38)
doing yeah I don't know if you'll be (78:36 - 78:39)
able to rebattle the elite four if (78:38 - 78:43)
they'll be stronger a second time or if (78:39 - 78:46)
you'll be able to battle Hassle and I (78:43 - 78:48)
don't remember the little girl's (78:46 - 78:51)
name I don't want to remember her name (78:48 - 78:54)
poppy poppy iy yeah yeah it is like (78:51 - 78:57)
don't know if you can battle her again (78:54 - 79:01)
um no clue what the b battle stuff would (78:57 - 79:03)
be (79:01 - 79:03)
but I I've said it before I'll say it (79:04 - 79:08)
again I like that they do the mass Opera (79:06 - 79:11)
XS now I like that they do the raid (79:08 - 79:14)
events um they did two distributions you (79:11 - 79:19)
can download a uh dark cry mystery (79:14 - 79:21)
gift and then for some reason they were (79:19 - 79:23)
like shiny Lucario and they made special (79:21 - 79:25)
art for (79:23 - 79:31)
it not 100% sure yeah yep some people (79:25 - 79:33)
speculated that it was because of Pala (79:31 - 79:36)
wins I didn't I I'm waiting till that (79:33 - 79:38)
season is done till I watch it you (79:36 - 79:40)
haven't watched the Su in snow so don't (79:38 - 79:42)
even lie to people I watched uh pathy (79:40 - 79:45)
the peak I like that PA the peak was (79:42 - 79:47)
really good yeah that is good but so is (79:45 - 79:49)
Hui and (79:47 - 79:52)
Snow Yeah three episodes is a (79:49 - 79:54)
lot (79:52 - 79:56)
uh they also announced that you'll be (79:54 - 79:58)
able to get a master ball master ball is (79:56 - 80:00)
not available yet uh it will be (79:58 - 80:02)
available on the 14th when the DLC comes (80:00 - 80:04)
out uh you there will be no code for it (80:02 - 80:06)
uh you'll just you'll just have to go to (80:04 - 80:09)
um connect via internet and then you (80:06 - 80:13)
should be able to get the master ball as (80:09 - 80:15)
well um and then I think the final bit (80:13 - 80:20)
of news is uh they showed a (80:15 - 80:24)
tree they showed a a a crystal tunnel (80:20 - 80:26)
they showed a crystal tunnel and a big (80:24 - 80:27)
sparkling (80:26 - 80:28)
tree (80:27 - 80:34)
um and it gave me big uh Ultra City (80:28 - 80:36)
Vibes do you remember when they showed (80:34 - 80:38)
Ultra sun and Ultra Moon and they showed (80:36 - 80:41)
the ultra pop popular ult the ultra town (80:38 - 80:44)
with the tower that you (80:41 - 80:47)
climb and at the very top of the tower (80:44 - 80:49)
is necrozma right that's where you fight (80:47 - 80:52)
the like level 70 necrozma and a lot of (80:49 - 80:53)
people lost to it cuz they were like (80:52 - 80:55)
like why is this random necrozma so high (80:53 - 80:57)
level compared to everything else we've (80:55 - 80:59)
done but in that do you guys remember it (80:57 - 81:01)
was just a hallway that's all it was (80:59 - 81:03)
yeah but before it came out people were (81:01 - 81:06)
like oh like a brand new area to there's (81:03 - 81:08)
nothing to explore there's no actual (81:06 - 81:11)
City it was just a hallway um I'm very (81:08 - 81:13)
worried that the tree in the tunnel is (81:11 - 81:15)
just that like it's just a tunnel that (81:13 - 81:17)
opens up in area zero you walk down at (81:15 - 81:18)
the trees at the end and that's like the (81:17 - 81:21)
final (81:18 - 81:21)
battle might be a little bit more than (81:22 - 81:28)
just one battle but it might be (81:24 - 81:30)
that I just don't know if there' be like (81:28 - 81:34)
a whole another floor of area zero to (81:30 - 81:36)
explore the only thing that makes me (81:34 - 81:37)
think that there might be is the (81:36 - 81:40)
background with no wait cuz jolk is (81:37 - 81:42)
going be in blueberry never mind nope I (81:40 - 81:44)
know JK's in the blueberry cave yeah (81:42 - 81:48)
yeah the the fake charge Stone (81:44 - 81:49)
[Laughter] (81:48 - 81:52)
cave yeah so no it's probably just going (81:49 - 81:54)
to be a hallway but it's going to be (81:52 - 81:55)
some real cool story lines it be a (81:54 - 81:59)
really cute hallway yeah maybe you can (81:55 - 82:00)
get some good selfies in the (81:59 - 82:03)
hallway or maybe maybe you can maybe (82:00 - 82:04)
it's just like a cut scene hallway maybe (82:03 - 82:05)
you can't actually run down the hallway (82:04 - 82:08)
yourself I don't know and if it counts (82:05 - 82:11)
as inside in any way you can't even use (82:08 - 82:12)
the (82:11 - 82:14)
camera oh yeah can you not use the (82:12 - 82:18)
camera area Zer uh you can in area zero (82:14 - 82:20)
but not when you're inside buildings so (82:18 - 82:22)
if they for some reason count the (82:20 - 82:24)
hallway as an inside (82:22 - 82:27)
Area because you are going down below (82:24 - 82:29)
any part of area zero you've been into (82:27 - 82:31)
before going deeper than any explorers (82:29 - 82:34)
have ever been (82:31 - 82:40)
below uh the basement the zero lab (82:34 - 82:42)
there's a secret (82:40 - 82:46)
compartment that you didn't see (82:42 - 82:46)
before sure I have theories I have (82:46 - 82:54)
theories there's a there is a door there (82:51 - 82:55)
is a (82:54 - 82:58)
door (82:55 - 83:00)
um they did show starters in the trailer (82:58 - 83:04)
um I said this in my YouTube (83:00 - 83:07)
preview uh there were no starters in the (83:04 - 83:08)
wild when I (83:07 - 83:11)
played uh I do think starters are good (83:08 - 83:13)
candidates for mass (83:11 - 83:16)
outbreaks (83:13 - 83:19)
um but I I'm curious of how much of the (83:16 - 83:21)
starter stuff is tied to like (83:19 - 83:24)
BBQs (83:21 - 83:27)
yeah BBQ's or maybe it could be tied to (83:24 - 83:30)
the running around as a Pokemon thing in (83:27 - 83:31)
some (83:30 - 83:35)
way run around as a squirtle to get more (83:31 - 83:37)
Squirtle up the starters are rare (83:35 - 83:39)
because they only show up for other (83:37 - 83:41)
Pokemon and they go and hide when people (83:39 - 83:43)
are running around that kind of (83:41 - 83:46)
thing yeah I don't know can you catch (83:43 - 83:50)
other Pokemon when you are as a I don't (83:46 - 83:51)
think so don't (83:50 - 83:54)
know (83:51 - 83:56)
it's really weird questions questions (83:54 - 83:58)
and (83:56 - 83:58)
questions uh yeah uh I think I think (84:04 - 84:09)
that's I think that's everything for (84:07 - 84:12)
what they showed um without going too (84:09 - 84:13)
deep into the story but I'm sure there (84:12 - 84:15)
are people that are frantically trying (84:13 - 84:18)
to finish the teal mask this week so let (84:15 - 84:19)
you experience that on your own I will (84:18 - 84:23)
say well say it again you have to finish (84:19 - 84:26)
the teal mask to progress the story yep (84:23 - 84:28)
so and you have to finish the main game (84:26 - 84:30)
you have to finish both the main game (84:28 - 84:31)
you have to get to credits and you have (84:30 - 84:35)
to finish teal mask you have toet (84:31 - 84:37)
blueberry uh I'm assuming if you're (84:35 - 84:38)
listening to a Pokemon podcast you've at (84:37 - 84:41)
least done that part um but if if the (84:38 - 84:44)
starter stuff if the legendary stuff if (84:41 - 84:46)
any of this stuff is really appealing to (84:44 - 84:49)
you you got a week you got less than a (84:46 - 84:53)
week honestly um to finish (84:49 - 84:56)
uh the teal and like you can power (84:53 - 84:58)
through the teal mask story pretty (84:56 - 85:02)
quickly the Palo story is very (84:58 - 85:06)
long as somebody who's done the Pala (85:02 - 85:08)
Story three and a half (85:06 - 85:12)
times I don't think it's bad and I think (85:08 - 85:15)
the first time I did it I felt (85:12 - 85:18)
so worldl winy like there's just so much (85:15 - 85:19)
to do you're going everywhere you're (85:18 - 85:21)
seeing new Pokemon you're seeing new (85:19 - 85:24)
characters it felt like it just flew by (85:21 - 85:25)
oh the second time you go through that (85:24 - 85:29)
you're like this is a lot like eight (85:25 - 85:33)
take a while five five totem things five (85:29 - 85:35)
team (85:33 - 85:35)
star it's big and that's not a for a (85:35 - 85:42)
replay it's really good for a main main (85:39 - 85:44)
first play the first time you're going (85:42 - 85:47)
through it there's a lot there but in a (85:44 - 85:50)
replay it is (85:47 - 85:50)
big (85:51 - 85:54)
I'm excited for the DLC uh it comes out (85:54 - 86:01)
maybe Wednesday night in the US Thursday (85:57 - 86:03)
for everyone they say but when they say (86:01 - 86:06)
everyone they mean Japan (86:03 - 86:08)
yeah (86:06 - 86:10)
so uh that being said I will be (86:08 - 86:13)
streaming it on Twitch uh I regardless (86:10 - 86:16)
of if it comes out Wednesday morning or (86:13 - 86:19)
Wednesday night because Japan because (86:16 - 86:21)
time zones I will still be starting on (86:19 - 86:25)
Thursday at around noon central time and (86:21 - 86:27)
I'll be streaming the DLC that way if it (86:25 - 86:28)
does come out on Wednesday night you (86:27 - 86:31)
guys can play it and then come to my (86:28 - 86:33)
stream and then be like I'm three hours (86:31 - 86:34)
ahead of you and like perfect I'm going (86:33 - 86:36)
to catch Miler for the next four hours (86:34 - 86:40)
so continue to be ahead of me um so I (86:36 - 86:42)
know people want to watch stuff but they (86:40 - 86:44)
also don't want to be spoiled so that's (86:42 - 86:46)
why like doesn't matter if it comes out (86:44 - 86:47)
on Wednesday night I'll be starting on (86:46 - 86:50)
that Thursday at 12 o'clock unless for (86:47 - 86:51)
some (86:50 - 86:54)
reason it comes out at a weird time who (86:51 - 86:56)
knows yeah who (86:54 - 87:00)
knows but that's uh that's the plan (86:56 - 87:01)
going (87:00 - 87:03)
forward (87:01 - 87:05)
um I a't got anything else you guys got (87:03 - 87:07)
anything before we wrap up uh quick (87:05 - 87:11)
unite thing uh mosara can be gotten for (87:07 - 87:16)
free uh you do have to do a bunch of win (87:11 - 87:19)
games with X type of character I have (87:16 - 87:22)
tested this you can do that in the solo (87:19 - 87:23)
challenge (87:22 - 87:26)
seemingly on any level and it counts so (87:23 - 87:28)
if you just want to collect your (87:26 - 87:31)
pedals just do the solo challenge go on (87:28 - 87:34)
like intermediate they're easy it's it's (87:31 - 87:38)
just a bot match the only issue is they (87:34 - 87:42)
are really extending out how to get (87:38 - 87:44)
enough pedals to get the license for (87:42 - 87:48)
free I completed everything and I don't (87:44 - 87:50)
get the next set of tasks for another (87:48 - 87:53)
three days so there is one where you (87:50 - 87:55)
have to log in consecutive days but if (87:53 - 87:57)
you want to wait until next week when (87:55 - 87:59)
more of the things are available so you (87:57 - 88:03)
get more of them done you can do that uh (87:59 - 88:06)
but yeah I have confirmed that you can (88:03 - 88:09)
win games in the soo Challenge and it (88:06 - 88:10)
does count as completions for the (88:09 - 88:15)
moscara license game uh to get the LI (88:10 - 88:17)
get the license for free (88:15 - 88:23)
MCA fine not not gamebreaking not what's (88:17 - 88:26)
it unite ability it has a very strange (88:23 - 88:29)
unite ability in the fact that you point (88:26 - 88:33)
in a direction it's kind of like crar (88:29 - 88:36)
ants where it's got a big Whirlwind of (88:33 - 88:39)
leaves around it and so masara walks (88:36 - 88:42)
very slowly in whatever Direction you've (88:39 - 88:47)
pointed um you can eject button forward (88:42 - 88:49)
to make it to catch people if they start (88:47 - 88:52)
running away um but you are just on the (88:49 - 88:54)
sort of slow path and everybody who's in (88:52 - 88:57)
it gets caught so (88:54 - 89:00)
um daming them or it's pulling them in (88:57 - 89:02)
it's damaging them okay but it doesn't (89:00 - 89:04)
pull them in I think it technically also (89:02 - 89:05)
slows them a little but again it's the (89:04 - 89:07)
same problem where people just eject out (89:05 - 89:09)
there's so many ways to get out of (89:07 - 89:11)
things but eject button does work so if (89:09 - 89:13)
they eject out you can eject forward (89:11 - 89:16)
while it's still going um and get them (89:13 - 89:19)
so you put her what if you put her on a (89:16 - 89:21)
Lapras I have not seen anybody do that (89:19 - 89:25)
yet the problem is is that she walks (89:21 - 89:28)
while doing the unite so I do think you (89:25 - 89:30)
would walk off (89:28 - 89:33)
Lapras uh and and fall behind um I (89:30 - 89:36)
haven't seen anybody do it uh recently (89:33 - 89:38)
um not there not been a lot of fun (89:36 - 89:41)
people on the back of Lapras in any of (89:38 - 89:44)
my games recently oh oh another weird (89:41 - 89:45)
thing they (89:44 - 89:49)
changed you can't drop ranks anymore it (89:45 - 89:53)
seemingly so if you get to Ultra (89:49 - 89:56)
even if you fail in Ultra 5 you are in (89:53 - 89:58)
Ultra (89:56 - 90:01)
seemingly permanently so you can't drop (89:58 - 90:04)
down to veteran I I haven't seen it like (90:01 - 90:06)
listed in any of their stuff but (90:04 - 90:08)
everybody who's been playing the game is (90:06 - 90:10)
like once I've gotten to ultra and I've (90:08 - 90:12)
dropped should have dropped back into (90:10 - 90:14)
veteran I've stayed in Ultra class like (90:12 - 90:17)
you used to in in Masters this is both a (90:14 - 90:20)
blessing and a curse CU there are people (90:17 - 90:22)
that should be dropping lower (90:20 - 90:25)
who are stuck in Ultra so Ultra matches (90:22 - 90:28)
get real dicey sometimes um because you (90:25 - 90:30)
just aren't filtering out (90:28 - 90:34)
people who who probably should be lower (90:30 - 90:36)
um I think overall it is a better (90:34 - 90:37)
experience because it's super (90:36 - 90:40)
frustrating to be forced down into (90:37 - 90:42)
veteran and then fight your all way back (90:40 - 90:44)
up to ultra then all the way back up (90:42 - 90:46)
overall I think it's a positive change (90:44 - 90:50)
but yeah just be aware that some of your (90:46 - 90:53)
low-level Ultra matches get really dice (90:50 - 90:55)
there's some real there's some real (90:53 - 90:57)
people who just do not know what they're (90:55 - 90:59)
doing right now uh that's the same with (90:57 - 91:01)
anything I hit Masters (90:59 - 91:03)
today pretty quick it's probably the (91:01 - 91:06)
fastest I've gotten to Masters uh in the (91:03 - 91:08)
game so I think the game's a good place (91:06 - 91:10)
uh if you want to know what the most OP (91:08 - 91:14)
character is right now mimiku mimiku is (91:10 - 91:17)
by far way (91:14 - 91:19)
overpowered uh play rough is just a (91:17 - 91:22)
nightmare to deal with um (91:19 - 91:25)
but yeah it it's if you want to just get (91:22 - 91:28)
Meara go ahead and do the solo Q stuff (91:25 - 91:30)
the solo Q stuff is fun I mean it's just (91:28 - 91:33)
bot it's just a bot match (91:30 - 91:35)
against (91:33 - 91:38)
Cynthia Cynthia Cynthia's the is the (91:35 - 91:41)
leader and if you do all the all of the (91:38 - 91:43)
solo stuff you get Cynthia's outfit they (91:41 - 91:44)
brought it back this time so you can (91:43 - 91:46)
dress yourself up like Cynthia if you (91:44 - 91:50)
want awesome Hannah you got anything (91:46 - 91:55)
nope I'm all good all right highly (91:50 - 91:55)

those that play Slowly like myself um (92:15 - 92:21)
debatable uh there'll probably be no (92:19 - 92:25)
story stuff next week uh because I'm (92:21 - 92:26)
sure people will be catching Mysteries (92:25 - 92:30)
or becoming a crar an or becoming you (92:26 - 92:31)
know a Reggie gigas actually I don't (92:30 - 92:33)
think Reggie gigas is allowed in the (92:31 - 92:35)
game uh but becom whatever Pokemon you (92:33 - 92:37)
want to be be whatever Pokemon you want (92:35 - 92:40)

wants to be that arudo but you could you (92:40 - 92:45)
could be that arudo that could be you (92:42 - 92:46)
you could be the first person in the (92:45 - 92:49)
world that transforms into an audo think (92:46 - 92:51)
