[Music] (0:13 - 0:25)
what's up everyone welcome to the (0:23 - 0:28)
586th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:25 - 0:31)
from South Korea I guess I'm your host (0:28 - 0:33)
Steve with me is (0:31 - 0:36)
Hannah I am not in South Korea although (0:33 - 0:38)
it seems like a pretty fun event so I (0:36 - 0:41)
kind of wish I was I am in a place that (0:38 - 0:43)
has been Sunny for the past few days but (0:41 - 0:45)
I haven't been able to go outside cuz I (0:43 - 0:47)
sprained my ankle this week (0:45 - 0:54)
what yep I was uh Mak you making routes (0:47 - 0:56)
weren't you you're making routes and (0:54 - 0:57)
you're trying to get people killed and (0:56 - 0:59)
you're getting all dangerous and you (0:57 - 1:01)
sprain drink you heard I wouldn't make a (0:59 - 1:02)
route that's dangerous like that I would (1:01 - 1:05)
make a route on a forest path that has (1:02 - 1:07)
no (1:05 - 1:07)
streets Greg also here I am also here (1:07 - 1:15)
and I am gainfully employed once again (1:12 - 1:17)
so now I start the wonderful process of (1:15 - 1:21)
figuring out how to tell my Pokemon (1:17 - 1:22)
sleep that I have a different sleep and (1:21 - 1:24)
waking up time because now I have to get (1:22 - 1:28)
up to do a job instead of what I've been (1:24 - 1:32)
doing which is like well whatever (1:28 - 1:33)
uh well it's normal time for you two it (1:32 - 1:35)
is uh (1:33 - 1:38)
12:16 a.m. for me I'm not going to say (1:35 - 1:40)
that it's normal time because usually (1:38 - 1:43)
it's the afternoon it is 10: in the (1:40 - 1:44)
morning it (1:43 - 1:48)
is sunrise with spraining MC ankle over (1:44 - 1:52)
there woke up before sunrise here all (1:48 - 1:55)
right well we'll make it short and sweet (1:52 - 1:58)
we're mostly going to talk about (1:55 - 2:00)
this we're mostly going to talk about (1:58 - 2:01)
about the Safari own stuff and how that (2:00 - 2:03)
works cuz this is the first time they've (2:01 - 2:04)
done an event like this but we do have (2:03 - 2:06)
other Pokémon news so let's get through (2:04 - 2:07)
that (2:06 - 2:09)
first obviously we have to start with (2:07 - 2:13)
Pokemon sleep um before we do our (2:09 - 2:16)
check-ins uh leaves changing warm drinks (2:13 - 2:18)
and tasty treats a special bundle (2:16 - 2:21)
special bundles will be added throughout (2:18 - 2:23)
the week containing lots of goodies free (2:21 - 2:28)
bundles also included check the store (2:23 - 2:28)
daily um that's off the official Pokemon (2:28 - 2:33)
sleep Twitter (2:31 - 2:36)
uh I like our Pokemon sleep overlords (2:33 - 2:39)
and the incredibly high prices they set (2:36 - 2:43)
for us who's buying this but the boxes (2:39 - 2:45)
are free they're are daily free boxes (2:43 - 2:47)
it's so (2:45 - 2:50)
nice is it going to be like one small (2:47 - 2:52)
ingredient ticket and then like two (2:50 - 2:54)
apples the next (2:52 - 2:58)
day no I think I think that the daily (2:54 - 3:01)
bundle is the same thing every day it's (2:58 - 3:03)
two small ingredient tickets and two (3:01 - 3:08)
poke biscuits oh that's pretty okay yeah (3:03 - 3:12)
I have so many poke biscuits I don't I (3:08 - 3:15)
feel like I can't I use all of mine yeah (3:12 - 3:17)
I what are you doing why most of these (3:15 - 3:19)
things are catching I'm always catching (3:17 - 3:22)
CP cuz you could catch better ones yeah (3:19 - 3:24)
yeah when you keep catching them they (3:22 - 3:26)
get better every time you catch the next (3:24 - 3:28)
one that's what the friendship level is (3:26 - 3:31)
there for yeah better better at what (3:28 - 3:33)
sitting around sleeping I don't need you (3:31 - 3:34)
lazy (3:33 - 3:37)
people feel like you're being I'm (3:34 - 3:39)
running a halfway house for Pokemon over (3:37 - 3:42)
here I need you people to work I need (3:39 - 3:43)
you to get into raids I need you to (3:42 - 3:45)
fight this giant fighting bird and I (3:43 - 3:48)
need you awake what birds are you (3:45 - 3:51)
fighting in Pokemon sleep I'm not (3:48 - 3:52)
fighting them in Pokemon sleep I'm (3:51 - 3:55)
fighting them in scarlet and (3:52 - 3:57)
violet yeah to what happened there's a (3:55 - 4:01)
big mean owl that's yelling at (3:57 - 4:03)
people uh Pokemon sleep's still good I'm (4:01 - 4:04)
still playing (4:03 - 4:08)
it yep that that's the check in I hit (4:04 - 4:11)
the button (4:08 - 4:11)
[Laughter] (4:11 - 4:17)
twice that's it oh get get your free (4:14 - 4:19)
bundles I guess um I do kind of wish (4:17 - 4:21)
that I had more reasons to give it money (4:19 - 4:25)
but also not right now no not yeah I (4:21 - 4:27)
think I I think I agree with that uh (4:25 - 4:29)
speaking of the thing you cannot give (4:27 - 4:30)
money anymore (4:29 - 4:33)
uh Pokemon Bank this is off (4:30 - 4:36)
nintendolife.com uh Pokemon Bank users (4:33 - 4:39)
encourage to transfer Pokemon to Pokemon (4:36 - 4:43)
home ASAP quote Banks online service may (4:39 - 4:47)
end at some point in the (4:43 - 4:47)
future um so this is following play (4:47 - 4:53)
Pokemon tweeting Nintendo 3DS online (4:50 - 4:56)
services will be discontinued in April (4:53 - 4:57)
of (4:56 - 5:00)
2024 while Pokemon Bank can be used (4:57 - 5:02)
beyond that date this is what Pokemon is (5:00 - 5:05)
saying we encourage players to transfer (5:02 - 5:07)
their Pokemon to Pokemon home at their (5:05 - 5:09)
earliest (5:07 - 5:11)
convenience (5:09 - 5:16)
so I don't as of this podcast one it is (5:11 - 5:17)
very late and I'm in South Korea so we (5:16 - 5:19)
don't need a one hour I could easily (5:17 - 5:21)
talk about this for two hours is what (5:19 - 5:26)
I'm saying but maybe not this episode uh (5:21 - 5:28)
I don't know what the world looks like (5:26 - 5:30)
when this completely shuts down (5:28 - 5:33)
cuz we've had connectivity (5:30 - 5:37)
from Ruby Sapphire Coliseum Gale of (5:33 - 5:38)
Darkness those are probably the oldest (5:37 - 5:42)
games up to now and this one (5:38 - 5:47)
specific 200 kilobyte application is the (5:42 - 5:51)
last bridge that puts those games from (5:47 - 5:55)
the 3DS to the switch and what was the (5:51 - 5:58)
exact words may not be available at some (5:55 - 6:01)
point in time is (5:58 - 6:03)
is disheartening disappointing (6:01 - 6:07)
frustrating it's a lot of things unless (6:03 - 6:09)
they just come out and say we got (6:07 - 6:10)
something new like a QR code that will (6:09 - 6:13)
generate or something that will send (6:10 - 6:13)
those (6:13 - 6:15)
over I don't think they're doing that (6:13 - 6:17)
though you know here's the thing that I (6:15 - 6:18)
thought of (6:17 - 6:21)
immediately I need to get I need to get (6:18 - 6:23)
you my copy of Pokemon bank so you can (6:21 - 6:26)
get the one thing you can get out of (6:23 - 6:29)
bank before it all shuts down cuz that's (6:26 - 6:32)
the only way you'll get it out of bank (6:29 - 6:35)
you have to get out of the old Pokemon (6:32 - 6:38)
GameCube thing the thing that only I (6:35 - 6:40)
have apparently oh (6:38 - 6:43)
box box so you have to get (6:40 - 6:46)
box and then do all the things to get (6:43 - 6:49)
the one thing before all this shuts down (6:46 - 6:49)
in (6:49 - 6:52)
2024 yeah it's like a skdy with payday I (6:49 - 6:56)
think is exclusive to box and there's I (6:52 - 6:59)
think no that's my well maybe box say me (6:56 - 7:01)
my Pokemon Ranch had a bunch of stuff (6:59 - 7:05)
that I never did had a a Mew as well it (7:01 - 7:10)
was like Rachel's Mew or Jessica I (7:05 - 7:13)
remember her name Pokemon box was almost (7:10 - 7:15)
definitely a Skitty though cuz that was (7:13 - 7:17)
that went along with (7:15 - 7:19)
hoen yeah yeah yeah yeah there was a (7:17 - 7:20)
couple things you could get but from box (7:19 - 7:22)
I think skdy was one of the final ones (7:20 - 7:24)
cuz it like only meow new payday and (7:22 - 7:26)
then they gave another Pokemon payday (7:24 - 7:28)
and then they took it away and then they (7:26 - 7:30)
skdy with payday I don't even know if (7:28 - 7:32)
skdy with payday from box would still (7:30 - 7:33)
know (7:32 - 7:36)
payday in well skidy can't even go into (7:33 - 7:38)
scarland Violet and Skitty can go into a (7:36 - 7:40)
sword and shield so I don't actually (7:38 - 7:42)
know okay here are the things you can (7:40 - 7:46)
get pdsp you can get a special swablu a (7:42 - 7:48)
special Zig zigon a special skiddy and a (7:46 - 7:54)
special Pichu oh Pichu my favorite hoen (7:48 - 7:57)
Pokemon perfect (7:54 - 8:00)
um there's like this (7:57 - 8:05)
over there the the fans I think that are (8:00 - 8:10)
moving Pokemon from Emerald or Diamond (8:05 - 8:12)
and Pearl (8:10 - 8:17)
into scarlet and violet are probably one (8:12 - 8:20)
in a 100 it's probably such a small (8:17 - 8:23)
amount of the player base most if any of (8:20 - 8:26)
those players are still doing that (8:23 - 8:28)
they're probably listening to the show (8:26 - 8:30)
or they're probably like on like R SL (8:28 - 8:32)
pookemon ribbons because they're moving (8:30 - 8:35)
whatever thing they caught in Gale of (8:32 - 8:36)
Darkness up and over and trying to get (8:35 - 8:39)
all the ribbons (8:36 - 8:41)
um (8:39 - 8:44)
but I get it but at the same time like (8:41 - 8:46)
they kind of sold us (8:44 - 8:48)
this (8:46 - 8:50)
dream (8:48 - 8:53)
of your Pokemon being a like we're so (8:50 - 8:55)
sorry we couldn't connect the Game Boy (8:53 - 8:57)
to the Game Boy Advance we're starting (8:55 - 8:58)
over we're so so sorry it'll never (8:57 - 9:01)
happen again it feels like it's about to (8:58 - 9:04)
happen again mhm yep I mean this is a (9:01 - 9:07)
little this is a little different in the (9:04 - 9:08)
fact that we've had this connectivity (9:07 - 9:12)
for a number of years now it's been a (9:08 - 9:14)
long (9:12 - 9:18)
time and I think like I do agree it's a (9:14 - 9:21)
very very tiny amount of people that are (9:18 - 9:23)
that haven't moved all the Pokemon that (9:21 - 9:25)
they want in in the number of years that (9:23 - 9:28)
we've been able to do this and or are (9:25 - 9:31)
replaying the those games where they're (9:28 - 9:32)
getting things that they want to (9:31 - 9:39)
transfer up um I do hope there is some (9:32 - 9:41)
solution to keep the connectivity for (9:39 - 9:44)
all of that (9:41 - 9:48)
but we've had a really long time longer (9:44 - 9:51)
than it's been about 10 years longer (9:48 - 9:53)
than most backwards compatibility works (9:51 - 9:55)
and for a company like Nintendo who (9:53 - 9:57)
seems to actively hate backwards (9:55 - 9:58)
compatibility because they want to (9:57 - 10:00)
resell you stuff (9:58 - 10:04)
uh it's been nice that we could do (10:00 - 10:08)
it yeah I guess as we closer to April of (10:04 - 10:11)
2024 we will probably have this (10:08 - 10:13)
conversation again but I suppose if you (10:11 - 10:16)
are doing a ribbon Quest (10:13 - 10:21)
maybe after hurry up the DLC is good (10:16 - 10:24)
maybe you have a thing to do after that (10:21 - 10:27)
hurry up get that done maybe if you were (10:24 - 10:30)
starting maybe starting a ribbon from (10:27 - 10:35)
Coliseum maybe now's the time to start (10:30 - 10:37)
it (10:35 - 10:40)
yeah okay uh again we'll we'll probably (10:37 - 10:44)
have more to say as as we move closer to (10:40 - 10:46)
whatever nightmare situation that's (10:44 - 10:47)
going to (10:46 - 10:50)
become speaking of some okay news for (10:47 - 10:53)
scarland Violet uh if you are in Canada (10:50 - 10:57)
or the US and there is a Mimi Q coming (10:53 - 11:01)
um oh gosh I lost the date I think it's (10:57 - 11:03)
October 14th they're going to be (11:01 - 11:05)
available um very soon anyways it'll be (11:03 - 11:09)
a mimik Q and cherish ball uh it will (11:05 - 11:10)
have the electric terot type we've (11:09 - 11:12)
talked about this before it will have (11:10 - 11:16)
the uh classic ribbon um so those are (11:12 - 11:18)
codes that you'll have to get from (11:16 - 11:20)
Gamestop every time we bring up GameStop (11:18 - 11:21)
in Pokemon (11:20 - 11:24)
distribution nightmare situations of (11:21 - 11:25)
they they don't have a code they didn't (11:24 - 11:27)
get enough codes somebody came in and (11:25 - 11:29)
took a 100 codes the GameStop employees (11:27 - 11:32)
are selling codes on eBay uh they're (11:29 - 11:34)
trying to sell you an issue of game does (11:32 - 11:35)
Game Informer still exist they're trying (11:34 - 11:36)
to sell you an issue of Game Informer to (11:35 - 11:40)
get a code I repeat I think it's only (11:36 - 11:43)
digital I think it might be at the very (11:40 - 11:46)
latest these are free gameinformer.com (11:43 - 11:48)
right (11:46 - 11:50)
there you know game informers is out of (11:48 - 11:52)
Minnesota Minneapolis yep I know I (11:50 - 11:55)
almost got a job with them uh you do not (11:52 - 11:58)
need to pay anything to get this Mimi Q (11:55 - 12:01)
code although (11:58 - 12:02)
they might be (12:01 - 12:04)
out so if you (12:02 - 12:08)
care uh go as soon as possible I guess (12:04 - 12:11)
don't go to period of time I liked it (12:08 - 12:12)
for the brief period of time where they (12:11 - 12:15)
printed out them on receipts so that no (12:12 - 12:17)
matter how many people came in they (12:15 - 12:20)
could all get a code instead of just (12:17 - 12:23)
running out of the physical cards very (12:20 - 12:26)
quickly while I do like collecting the (12:23 - 12:27)
giveaway (12:26 - 12:30)
cards I liked it when I I was able to go (12:27 - 12:31)
in there and know that I was going to (12:30 - 12:33)
get the thing I was going to GameStop (12:31 - 12:35)
for the only thing I was going to (12:33 - 12:38)
GameStop for the only thing anybody goes (12:35 - 12:40)
driving 20 minutes to GameStop for them (12:38 - 12:44)
to be like we're out and then yep yeah I (12:40 - 12:46)
was told recently by a GameStop employee (12:44 - 12:48)
that they don't they can't print them on (12:46 - 12:51)
receipt anymore something changed yeah I (12:48 - 12:53)
don't think they can yeah I don't know (12:51 - 12:55)
what the logistics was when I worked at (12:53 - 12:57)
GameStop there was just a button you (12:55 - 12:59)
pressed and then because (12:57 - 13:02)
uh that would print it on the code or on (12:59 - 13:04)
the receipt on receipt paper but once (13:02 - 13:08)
you like pulled it up in their archaic (13:04 - 13:10)
register system all you would do is like (13:08 - 13:12)
you would just hit the button again and (13:10 - 13:13)
then would do another one so you just (13:12 - 13:15)
keep tapping it over and over and it (13:13 - 13:17)
would just keep making new codes and it (13:15 - 13:19)
worked um I don't I don't know what (13:17 - 13:20)
changed I also haven't worked at (13:19 - 13:23)
GameStop in like 15 years so I mean a (13:20 - 13:25)
lot has changed at (13:23 - 13:27)
GameStop I promise you they're probably (13:25 - 13:29)
still using the same computer system (13:27 - 13:32)
though I mean I guarantee it but yeah no (13:29 - 13:34)
way they updated (13:32 - 13:37)
that you know apart from from nearly (13:34 - 13:39)
going out of business and being saved by (13:37 - 13:42)
the internet briefly there's not a lot (13:39 - 13:44)
of great things happening at (13:42 - 13:47)
GameStop um the other thing the other (13:44 - 13:48)
news that happened this week is (13:47 - 13:51)
detective Pikachu returns arrived on the (13:48 - 13:53)
Nintendo switch it's been what like four (13:51 - 13:56)
or 5 years since the 3DS one came out in (13:53 - 13:59)
the US is available exclusively for (13:56 - 14:02)
Nintendo switch retail digital (13:59 - 14:06)
um it's an interactive story with very (14:02 - 14:08)
simple puzzle elements I wouldn't (14:06 - 14:10)
purchase this (14:08 - 14:14)
game if you don't like Puzzles number (14:10 - 14:17)
one and I wouldn't purchase this game if (14:14 - 14:19)
you don't like interactive (14:17 - 14:21)
stories if you like interactive stories (14:19 - 14:24)
with light puzzles you're a very (14:21 - 14:26)
probably small part of the market but (14:24 - 14:28)
this game is for you hello Professor (14:26 - 14:30)
Leon (14:28 - 14:32)
but Professor Leighton is like way more (14:30 - 14:36)
puzzle I know it's so much puzzle it's (14:32 - 14:40)
all it's only puzzle okay let's go back (14:36 - 14:41)
for those of you who used to like to (14:40 - 14:44)
play Mist back in the (14:41 - 14:44)
day this story at least makes sense okay (14:46 - 14:51)
I went to (14:49 - 14:56)
two Targets on Saturday two of them two (14:51 - 14:59)
of them to buy detective PE oh you were (14:56 - 15:00)
going to pay for this game with your own (14:59 - 15:04)
money look I was celebrating and I was (15:00 - 15:07)
feeling a little mad (15:04 - 15:10)
money so I was like why not I haven't (15:07 - 15:12)
purchased anything for myself in about (15:10 - 15:15)
seven months I'm going to go get this (15:12 - 15:18)
dumb game and I'm GNA play it and I went (15:15 - 15:21)
to two Targets and they didn't have it (15:18 - 15:24)
was a hit game neither one of them had (15:21 - 15:27)
it and I went to the big Target the most (15:24 - 15:29)
popular Target Minnesota by the (15:27 - 15:32)
university my local my local Target they (15:29 - 15:34)
did not have it out of St yeah that's (15:32 - 15:36)
cuz college kids are raving for (15:34 - 15:38)
detective they saw the they saw out of (15:36 - 15:41)
stock or never in stock did you ask I (15:38 - 15:42)
don't know because I wasn't there on (15:41 - 15:46)
Friday so I don't know if they I mean (15:42 - 15:47)
the the (15:46 - 15:51)
Northeast Target my target always gets (15:47 - 15:53)
everything because of the college kids (15:51 - 15:55)
but I didn't even see a spot for it yeah (15:53 - 15:58)
so I don't think they got it and then I (15:55 - 15:59)
had to look online and the only one that (15:58 - 16:05)
has is n and I'm not going to drive oh (15:59 - 16:08)
County where I can't get liquored (16:05 - 16:12)
up to get detective (16:08 - 16:12)
Pikachu it's probably why it was still (16:12 - 16:16)
in stock cuz there's no liquor next to (16:14 - 16:18)
it there's no liquor there you have to (16:16 - 16:20)
make you have to make that that decision (16:18 - 16:22)
to buy that thing when you're drunk then (16:20 - 16:24)
I went to Amazon and I'm like I have (16:22 - 16:26)
Prime they can get it to me on Monday no (16:24 - 16:29)
they can get it to me on Tuesday Tuesday (16:26 - 16:33)
day yeah Prime is bad (16:29 - 16:36)
what's what is this world coming to just (16:33 - 16:39)
get it digitally no I need to own I need (16:36 - 16:40)
to have it I want to touch it I need to (16:39 - 16:42)
touch it I don't trust (16:40 - 16:46)
digital so I have not played the full (16:42 - 16:49)
game I played the preview or whatever (16:46 - 16:52)
when I was in Seattle at Pax I went to (16:49 - 16:55)
PA for packs but then Nintendo was like (16:52 - 16:58)
do you want to play detective Pikachu (16:55 - 17:01)
for 20 minutes uh I enjoyed what I (16:58 - 17:03)
played but I did like the first (17:01 - 17:06)
detective Pikachu but again I liked it (17:03 - 17:08)
because I thought the characters and the (17:06 - 17:11)
story they told were pretty Charming as (17:08 - 17:16)
a game it is in my opinion kind of (17:11 - 17:18)
non-existent like there was maybe only (17:16 - 17:20)
one or two puzzles that were like I (17:18 - 17:23)
thought about for more than like 10 (17:20 - 17:25)
seconds but even even in the what I (17:23 - 17:28)
played for the the sequel if you got (17:25 - 17:30)
something wrong there's no punishment (17:28 - 17:32)
like a lot of the times it's like a b or (17:30 - 17:34)
c and you're like C and then it's like (17:32 - 17:37)
nope a nope oh I guess it's be okay (17:34 - 17:39)
we're moving on with the story like that (17:37 - 17:41)
like you cannot fail I think the cool (17:39 - 17:43)
thing at least I noticed I don't (17:41 - 17:45)
remember in the first one um is if you (17:43 - 17:47)
got something wrong Pikachu will at (17:45 - 17:49)
least like detective Pikachu not Pikachu (17:47 - 17:51)
detective Pikachu will at least (17:49 - 17:53)
detective Pikachu Ryan Reynold te tease (17:51 - 17:56)
you or make fun of you or like he'll (17:53 - 17:58)
have something at least witty to say so (17:56 - 18:00)
it's kind of almost like like I want to (17:58 - 18:03)
get it wrong because I I want to see (18:00 - 18:06)
like I want to see him be sassy so (18:03 - 18:09)
there's like some charm there of like (18:06 - 18:11)
got the more interesting (18:09 - 18:15)
dialog uh but overall the game got I (18:11 - 18:17)
don't think anyone thought detective (18:15 - 18:18)
Pikachu was going to come out and was (18:17 - 18:20)
going to get like n out of 10 10 out of (18:18 - 18:23)
10 like Game of the Year you must pick (18:20 - 18:26)
it up this weekend college kids in (18:23 - 18:29)
Minneapolis uh it got like sevens like (18:26 - 18:34)
three out of five s out of 10 um it's (18:29 - 18:37)
the same game like like it's not a it's (18:34 - 18:40)
not a deep it's not a deep game I'm not (18:37 - 18:43)
expecting it to win Awards and I I saw (18:40 - 18:46)
some comments of like oh Pokemon putting (18:43 - 18:50)
out another mediocre game but (18:46 - 18:53)
like in what Universe did we did we (18:50 - 18:54)
think detective Pikachu is going to be (18:53 - 18:57)
like a groundbreaking this was (18:54 - 19:00)
expected I want my detective Pikachu to (18:57 - 19:03)
be on the level of Elden ring please and (19:00 - 19:08)
thank you I need I need online hints I (19:03 - 19:11)
need to know which weapons to power (19:08 - 19:15)
up I needed to be open world and 300 (19:11 - 19:16)
hours (19:15 - 19:18)
long I need to be stuck on the same (19:16 - 19:22)
puzzle for 3 hours before I figure it (19:18 - 19:25)
out um yeah I mean I I don't think I was (19:22 - 19:27)
surprised by any of the reviews I also (19:25 - 19:29)
don't think (19:27 - 19:32)
I still think that (19:29 - 19:35)
like I'm as much I'm like excited to (19:32 - 19:37)
play this game when I get back for sure (19:35 - 19:38)
and I'm probably I'll probably try to (19:37 - 19:41)
play it in one sitting I I'm not 100% (19:38 - 19:42)
sure how long the game is the first game (19:41 - 19:47)
was maybe 10 or 12 hours long if you (19:42 - 19:49)
were reading everything yeah it wasn't (19:47 - 19:52)
long it wasn't it wasn't a big (19:49 - 19:55)
investment um but (19:52 - 19:58)
I I don't think I was like shocked by (19:55 - 20:00)
anything thing that came out about it so (19:58 - 20:02)
like again I think it would have (20:00 - 20:05)
probably felt different or felt bigger (20:02 - 20:07)
or felt more correct if it came out (20:05 - 20:09)
around the (20:07 - 20:12)
movie yeah but there's just like nothing (20:09 - 20:16)
tying it to anything it's just it's here (20:12 - 20:17)
now very (20:16 - 20:20)
late it continues the story from the (20:17 - 20:22)
first game (20:20 - 20:27)
mhm and that that very much is what it (20:22 - 20:29)
is and (20:27 - 20:31)
we know a lot of people didn't play the (20:29 - 20:34)
first game so here is here's a recap and (20:31 - 20:37)
we hope you purchase this nintend to put (20:34 - 20:39)
out a recap trailer I'm going to watch (20:37 - 20:41)
it right before I play it I think that (20:39 - 20:43)
trailer is in the game too that you can (20:41 - 20:45)
watch as well oh (20:43 - 20:48)
cool I bought it I downloaded it it took (20:45 - 20:50)
about 24 hours to download cuz my switch (20:48 - 20:54)
hates the internet but I (20:50 - 20:56)
have that's all (20:54 - 21:00)
switches yeah (20:56 - 21:03)
um yeah I'm I'm excited uh there are (21:00 - 21:07)
detective Pikachu icons in the switch (21:03 - 21:09)
icon store it's not even a store I don't (21:07 - 21:12)
even know what to call it it's the my (21:09 - 21:18)
Nintendo thing yeah uh Nintendo switch (21:12 - 21:20)
online so if you have Nintendo switch (21:18 - 21:24)
online you can go in there and go into (21:20 - 21:26)
the missions and rewards and get things (21:24 - 21:30)
with Platinum points yeah so there's a (21:26 - 21:32)
cool Ducket icon if you're into that (21:30 - 21:33)
she's (21:32 - 21:35)
awesome she's very cool she's in the (21:33 - 21:37)
game I believe there's also Karan in the (21:35 - 21:39)
game that's really the main reason I (21:37 - 21:41)
want to play it if there was no Karan I (21:39 - 21:43)
probably would have no (21:41 - 21:43)
interest um so we'll we'll report back (21:45 - 21:50)
on detective Pikachu but if you are on (21:47 - 21:52)
the fence um I have a YouTube video that (21:50 - 21:54)
answers a bunch of questions about (21:52 - 21:56)
detective Pikachu so what I played of it (21:54 - 21:59)
so if you want to know my thoughts (21:56 - 22:01)
there's a YouTube video uh about that on (21:59 - 22:08)
the channel uh I think that's all the (22:01 - 22:11)
news that we have that isn't Pokemon go (22:08 - 22:12)
related I'm there's probably something (22:11 - 22:14)
else I'm forgetting oh yeah I am (22:12 - 22:19)
forgetting deui came out grass Terra (22:14 - 22:23)
deui um it was (22:19 - 22:27)
fine yeah yeah it took me more than one (22:23 - 22:29)
try but it wasn't too hard (22:27 - 22:32)
yeah yeah yeah yeah it uh you know you (22:29 - 22:36)
look you look at De huian deciu eyes mov (22:32 - 22:40)
set and you're like it can't do that (22:36 - 22:43)
much different than the first deui (22:40 - 22:45)
they're they have some different (22:43 - 22:48)
moves I think that I think it is cool (22:45 - 22:52)
that this was the first sevenstar raid (22:48 - 22:56)
that the terot type matched one of the (22:52 - 22:59)
two primary typings of the raid boss so (22:56 - 23:04)
what that does is it makes any grass (22:59 - 23:07)
type moves even stronger than what you (23:04 - 23:10)
expect and then on top of that deu has (23:07 - 23:11)
grassy (23:10 - 23:13)
terrain to make those grass moves even (23:11 - 23:15)
stronger on top of like sword STS and (23:13 - 23:19)
stuff so I think that that concept is (23:15 - 23:22)
cool to show how powerful Terra can (23:19 - 23:26)
terizing to your same type can (23:22 - 23:30)
be um and did see how easy it was for (23:26 - 23:32)
people to feel very confident in the (23:30 - 23:34)
first half of that raid and then for (23:32 - 23:37)
thei to go like 30 times in a row it's (23:34 - 23:38)
like I'm going to Swords Dance I'm going (23:37 - 23:39)
to bulk up I'm going to grassy Terin I'm (23:38 - 23:41)
going to leafl I'm going to Triple like (23:39 - 23:43)
there's a one point where he does he (23:41 - 23:45)
does legitimately I think do three moves (23:43 - 23:46)
in a (23:45 - 23:51)
row um and I feel like if people don't (23:46 - 23:55)
stop to control that that's where they (23:51 - 23:57)
lose so it is like again maybe you've (23:55 - 23:59)
only done it once maybe you did with a (23:57 - 24:00)
coordinated group maybe you got lucky (23:59 - 24:03)
and you weren't paying attention but I (24:00 - 24:05)
do (24:03 - 24:08)
like kind of like failing The Raid to be (24:05 - 24:10)
like oh I understand what their gimmick (24:08 - 24:12)
was cuz when you succeed it you're like (24:10 - 24:15)
oh that was easy but what what were they (24:12 - 24:17)
trying to do there it's obvious what (24:15 - 24:20)
they're trying to like set you up in (24:17 - 24:22)
that second part to be like you need to (24:20 - 24:24)
control it reminded me very much of (24:22 - 24:26)
Final Fantasy 14 where it was like (24:24 - 24:27)
everyone needs to stop what they're (24:26 - 24:31)
doing do this right now for 10 seconds (24:27 - 24:33)
and then the rest will be easy but of (24:31 - 24:34)
course like there's always like two (24:33 - 24:36)
people that'll be like no it's fine and (24:34 - 24:38)
then it's like no just stop for a second (24:36 - 24:40)
just stop for one second I know the new (24:38 - 24:42)
raids just came out on Tuesday the end (24:40 - 24:44)
of the end Walker storyline just (24:42 - 24:47)
happened boy are those (24:44 - 24:49)
fun but yeah the first time I went into (24:47 - 24:52)
I'm like okay you're telling me (24:49 - 24:54)
something I don't know what that (24:52 - 24:57)
something is yet oh I died now I know (24:54 - 24:58)
what that something that now I know what (24:57 - 25:01)
you're trying to warn me about yeah good (24:58 - 25:03)
to know and toi just gets stronger and (25:01 - 25:05)
stronger and stronger and stronger right (25:03 - 25:10)
in that moment yeah I I did it random (25:05 - 25:13)
and I was having a ton of just hangup (25:10 - 25:16)
issues where I (25:13 - 25:18)
would select a move and then it would do (25:16 - 25:21)
its whole thing it's three moves and (25:18 - 25:23)
then I would just be locked out for a (25:21 - 25:25)
minute and then I would pop it and (25:23 - 25:30)
everything was done and I'm like (25:25 - 25:32)
I don't even know what (25:30 - 25:35)
happened I didn't even see what happened (25:32 - 25:38)
to know what to (25:35 - 25:41)
fix I almost wish that cuz I think (25:38 - 25:44)
people when D does three moves which is (25:41 - 25:46)
not the first time I think the the (25:44 - 25:48)
original DGI also did like three moves (25:46 - 25:51)
in a row at one point as well I think (25:48 - 25:53)
people think the raid is like lagging or (25:51 - 25:55)
broken which makes sense like I don't (25:53 - 25:59)
fault them feels that ways he like if (25:55 - 26:00)
you do like I did it what like six times (25:59 - 26:04)
in a row and it's like no he always does (26:00 - 26:06)
this specific thing when his I think (26:04 - 26:09)
it's like halfway through his shield or (26:06 - 26:10)
something like that it's like a certain (26:09 - 26:11)
point in the raid where he's like I'm (26:10 - 26:13)
going to Swords Dance I'm going to (26:11 - 26:15)
grassy terrain and I'm going to hit you (26:13 - 26:16)
with Leaf blade or (26:15 - 26:19)
something uh I just again I think raids (26:16 - 26:21)
are like two steps away from being (26:19 - 26:25)
perfect number one is please tell us (26:21 - 26:26)
what is actually happening like it would (26:25 - 26:29)
almost be nice if in like a standard (26:26 - 26:32)
jrpg I think in like Bravely Default or (26:29 - 26:36)
or P Persona they like kind of show in (26:32 - 26:37)
Legends had this Pokemon Legends had (26:36 - 26:39)
this where it showed their like move (26:37 - 26:42)
thing in the corner of like he did this (26:39 - 26:43)
he did this he did this and it would be (26:42 - 26:45)
so beneficial if you could just be like (26:43 - 26:49)
in the corner see like okay Swords Dance (26:45 - 26:52)
grassy terrain Leaf blade that wasn't (26:49 - 26:54)
the game lagging out those were the (26:52 - 26:57)
three moves he just did um they do it in (26:54 - 26:59)
Pokémon go (26:57 - 27:02)
yeah do do it in Pokémon go and and in (26:59 - 27:04)
scarlet and violet there's just so much (27:02 - 27:05)
going on and they're still trying to use (27:04 - 27:07)
the normal dialogue boxes and it doesn't (27:05 - 27:14)
work mhm they do do it in Pokemon go (27:07 - 27:18)
mhm well speaking of Pokemon go uh I did (27:14 - 27:20)
two days in Soul so uh let's take a (27:18 - 27:22)
break when we come back I'll tell you (27:20 - 27:23)
about that experience and whether you (27:22 - 27:27)
should go to Barcelona or I think for a (27:23 - 27:28)
lot of listeners (27:27 - 27:32)
uh Mexico city is close to the US so and (27:28 - 27:35)
that's like a month away so uh we will (27:32 - 27:39)
be right back and we are back uh (27:35 - 27:43)
disclosure Niantic did pay for my flight (27:39 - 27:44)
to (27:43 - 27:46)
cor not (27:44 - 27:48)
not Hannah tried to get on the plane and (27:46 - 27:49)
that's how Hannah (27:48 - 27:53)
spring running for that plane let me on (27:49 - 27:56)
I got to go for they also paid for 3 (27:53 - 27:58)
Days of hotel and then they paid for my (27:56 - 28:01)
ticket whatever how I think that was (27:58 - 28:03)
like 40,000 W which is like (28:01 - 28:06)
$34 or something so that's just not to (28:03 - 28:09)
brag just government disclosures I have (28:06 - 28:11)
to do that they notag I don't want to (28:09 - 28:14)
get I don't want to get yes I don't want (28:11 - 28:16)
want Niantic to yell at me that I also (28:14 - 28:19)
didn't disclose um so I have been here (28:16 - 28:20)
for 10 days that means the other seven (28:19 - 28:24)
days I did pay for my other Hotel all (28:20 - 28:26)
that stuff okay so the disclosure out of (28:24 - 28:29)
the way um this was a saari Zone the (28:26 - 28:30)
thing I've learned from streaming these (28:29 - 28:32)
on Twitch is no one has any clue what a (28:30 - 28:34)
safari zone is compared to a go Fest (28:32 - 28:36)
compared to a community day compared to (28:34 - 28:39)
uh the what are the other events they (28:36 - 28:43)
have it's weird big ones the US was (28:39 - 28:46)
supposed to have two Safari zones the (28:43 - 28:49)
Pittsburgh one and then the St Louis one (28:46 - 28:51)
that sounds right then they got (28:49 - 28:53)
cancelled because of coid and then they (28:51 - 28:55)
were at home and then the at home didn't (28:53 - 28:59)
work so there was a makeup at home again (28:55 - 29:00)
which that's no that shouldn't surprise (28:59 - 29:04)
anyone and then they did end up doing (29:00 - 29:06)
both of those but they had the caveat as (29:04 - 29:09)
like you don't actually have to come you (29:06 - 29:11)
could play wherever you are that's where (29:09 - 29:13)
Greg's car broke down cuz we did go down (29:11 - 29:16)
to St Louis but it didn't like it did (29:13 - 29:18)
feel like a safari (29:16 - 29:22)
zone but it also didn't because like (29:18 - 29:24)
people just didn't show up because they (29:22 - 29:26)
didn't need to show up and it was like (29:24 - 29:28)
canceled like 14 times (29:26 - 29:32)
yeah yeah it was so there was a Safari (29:28 - 29:34)
Zone in Canada and then there was a (29:32 - 29:37)
safari zone I think (29:34 - 29:40)
in not not Barcelona not somewhere in (29:37 - 29:43)
Spain I can't (29:40 - 29:44)
remembera (29:43 - 29:48)
C I think and then there might have been (29:44 - 29:50)
one in like Mexico at one point and then (29:48 - 29:53)
the one then there was one exactly a (29:50 - 29:57)
year ago in goyang uh which is about 30 (29:53 - 30:00)
minutes it's from Soul north of well not (29:57 - 30:04)
North Korea north of soul in South Korea (30:00 - 30:08)
um and that was at a park and I've (30:04 - 30:10)
talked about that it was you know it it (30:08 - 30:12)
kind of felt like a go Fest but there (30:10 - 30:14)
was a giant Lake and you walked around (30:12 - 30:17)
it and you f kind of felt like uh I have (30:14 - 30:18)
to walk another 30 minutes to get back (30:17 - 30:20)
to like food or bathrooms or something (30:18 - 30:22)
cuz it was just very big lake at a park (30:20 - 30:25)
that you had to walk around so to clear (30:22 - 30:29)
this up a safari zone is like a go Fest (30:25 - 30:33)
in the amount of time of 8 hours usually (30:29 - 30:37)
and multiple days uh and they have set (30:33 - 30:40)
spawns and they usually feature one or (30:37 - 30:43)
two new shinies like goyang last year I (30:40 - 30:47)
think was spritzy this year the featured (30:43 - 30:52)
shiny is skadoo it is pronounced sco not (30:47 - 30:54)
I I don't pick the names that's just how (30:52 - 30:57)
it's pronounced uh and then as opposed (30:54 - 30:58)
to what (30:57 - 31:03)
what kid kiddo is what a baby goat is (30:58 - 31:06)
right well I mean a baby baby go is the (31:03 - 31:09)
kid yeah but the word is kiddo that (31:06 - 31:13)
people are looking at see I'm not sure (31:09 - 31:15)
how they say yeah SK yeah yeah yeah but (31:13 - 31:19)
it's SK hey there sko how's it going how (31:15 - 31:22)
you doing I could also make this a t our (31:19 - 31:25)
podcast about how to say sco's name um (31:22 - 31:28)
and then they did Eevee with a safari (31:25 - 31:29)
hat that was also (31:28 - 31:33)
featured and so unlike past Safari zones (31:29 - 31:35)
they took what I think they heard from (31:33 - 31:39)
feedback from Seattle go Fest or the (31:35 - 31:43)
recent go Fest which is the city (31:39 - 31:46)
experience and I think for the most part (31:43 - 31:47)
people love the city experience because (31:46 - 31:50)
you can go anywhere you weren't confined (31:47 - 31:53)
to a park you it was easy easier to get (31:50 - 31:54)
food cuz you don't have to rely on like (31:53 - 31:55)
10 food (31:54 - 31:58)
trucks um oh yeah there's 's also okay (31:55 - 32:00)
so there's go Fest there's commun day (31:58 - 32:02)
there's Safari Zone and then there was (32:00 - 32:05)
whatever the hoen tour (32:02 - 32:05)
was too and which are changing each year (32:06 - 32:12)
yes so I would say safari zone is below (32:10 - 32:15)
that so you have go Fest being your (32:12 - 32:19)
premium big event with really good shiny (32:15 - 32:21)
odds and a lot of different Pokemon that (32:19 - 32:25)
appear to um the next level which is (32:21 - 32:28)
like a hoen jto tour to then underneath (32:25 - 32:33)
that would be a safari zone so shiny (32:28 - 32:35)
odds I don't know what they were Niantic (32:33 - 32:36)
doesn't tell (32:35 - 32:42)
us I felt like they're not as good as a (32:36 - 32:45)
ho and tour or go f not nearly as good (32:42 - 32:48)
as those not even like the global go (32:45 - 32:50)
Fest because some people would argue (32:48 - 32:52)
that the inperson go Fest is better than (32:50 - 32:54)
the global go Fest I would argue that I (32:52 - 32:56)
would I would say in person is better (32:54 - 32:59)
than global um I on average would get (32:56 - 33:02)
one shiny an hour and that's tapping a (32:59 - 33:03)
lot of Pokemon that's catching (33:02 - 33:06)
everything that's fast catching I'm sure (33:03 - 33:09)
there are people that got more but I (33:06 - 33:11)
don't think literally you could watch my (33:09 - 33:12)
streams you could watch my footage I (33:11 - 33:15)
don't think I'm like a slow Pokemon go (33:12 - 33:17)
player I think I'm very good at moving (33:15 - 33:21)
and tapping and all of that stuff um and (33:17 - 33:22)
that's what I really experienced last (33:21 - 33:24)
year at goyang too which is about like (33:22 - 33:29)
one an hour um I I don't like rating or (33:24 - 33:31)
reviewing events based on shinies it (33:29 - 33:33)
just doesn't make any sense to me of (33:31 - 33:35)
like man (33:33 - 33:38)
2020 2020 go Fest was amazing cuz I got (33:35 - 33:40)
50 shinies but 2022 sucked cuz I only (33:38 - 33:42)
got two shinies I just think that's like (33:40 - 33:45)
a such a weird way to review an event (33:42 - 33:47)
because you're literally you're (33:45 - 33:50)
literally reviewing it based off of RNG (33:47 - 33:52)
you're just reviewing it based off of (33:50 - 33:56)
how many D dice rolls you had I mean (33:52 - 34:00)
that's the only valid and proper (33:56 - 34:02)
meas so if you guys have questions I (34:00 - 34:05)
will answer but I will say I overall I (34:02 - 34:10)
really did like this um because I think (34:05 - 34:14)
there is I think it like thinking about (34:10 - 34:17)
goyang and so flying 14 (34:14 - 34:20)
hours to South Korea and then getting a (34:17 - 34:23)
hotel in Hong day and then taking a 30 (34:20 - 34:25)
minute train ride which was very (34:23 - 34:28)
pleasant very easy to do just I wanted (34:25 - 34:31)
to stay in hung day to goyang every day (34:28 - 34:33)
which was two days and then walking the (34:31 - 34:36)
same park for eight hours being like I'm (34:33 - 34:39)
in a brand new country and I now know (34:36 - 34:41)
the park like the back of my hand I can (34:39 - 34:44)
tell you ex I can pinpoint exactly what (34:41 - 34:46)
the cleanest urinal is cuz I've been in (34:44 - 34:48)
this park so (34:46 - 34:51)
much having to like explore the entire (34:48 - 34:53)
city of soul and being like I haven't (34:51 - 34:56)
been here yet like both days I went (34:53 - 34:58)
completely different directions and I (34:56 - 35:02)
saw brand new stuff and it was awesome (34:58 - 35:06)
the downside to that (35:02 - 35:09)
is you're not always surrounded by (35:06 - 35:12)
Pokemon players because you're in a city (35:09 - 35:16)
so like in goyang there was the the the (35:12 - 35:19)
picture area and the people trading and (35:16 - 35:21)
like it was really easy to be like do (35:19 - 35:23)
you have boulant do you have Tauros do (35:21 - 35:25)
you have Kangaskhan do you have well (35:23 - 35:26)
Hawlucha didn't exist people want (35:25 - 35:30)
Hawlucha really bad um that doesn't (35:26 - 35:33)
exist it does exist kind of but like not (35:30 - 35:35)
nearly the same as like we're all in a (35:33 - 35:38)
park experience so it's like weighing (35:35 - 35:41)
out those pros and cons of that it (35:38 - 35:43)
looked like there were parts of the city (35:41 - 35:46)
that they had decorated in Pokemon stuff (35:43 - 35:48)
though yes so that there were there were (35:46 - 35:50)
hubs or something yeah there were three (35:48 - 35:53)
hubs uh one was actually at the hotel (35:50 - 35:56)
that I booked I didn't know that that (35:53 - 35:57)
was going to be a h (35:56 - 36:01)
that was like Niantic was like here's (35:57 - 36:03)
some hotels we recommend and I was like (36:01 - 36:05)
cool thank you for recommending some (36:03 - 36:07)
hotels they were like here's our budget (36:05 - 36:08)
by the way I don't remember what like (36:07 - 36:10)
don't go over budget you can pick three (36:08 - 36:12)
nights we don't care what hotel and the (36:10 - 36:14)
all the hotels they recommended were all (36:12 - 36:17)
sold out so I was like okay well I want (36:14 - 36:19)
to be close to the hotels they (36:17 - 36:22)
recommended so I I picked the Sky Tree (36:19 - 36:23)
Hotel cuz it was literally 10 minutes (36:22 - 36:24)
away from the one they said they were (36:23 - 36:27)
staying at and this one ended up being (36:24 - 36:30)
one of the three hubs so (36:27 - 36:33)
amazing yeah so there was a huge Eevee (36:30 - 36:37)
poster on the front of my hotel and they (36:33 - 36:39)
had Eevee statues or they had the like (36:37 - 36:41)
the Pikachu Eevee statue they had the (36:39 - 36:45)
Foy Coco spatio um quackley statue they (36:41 - 36:47)
had uh there was a little K-pop photo (36:45 - 36:49)
booth in front of the hotel it looked (36:47 - 36:52)
like a little bus and just the next day (36:49 - 36:54)
it was all of a sudden it was a Pokémon (36:52 - 36:56)
bus I don't know what happened to K-pop (36:54 - 36:59)
gone now Pokémon um they had a bunch of (36:56 - 37:02)
tent set up obviously to hand out fisers (36:59 - 37:05)
and then they were playing the same song (37:02 - 37:10)
they've been playing for seven years (37:05 - 37:10)
the I please if I'm going to talk about (37:12 - 37:17)
the worst part of the event it is that (37:15 - 37:20)
song please change it add two more songs (37:17 - 37:23)
in a rotation at least um I can't (37:20 - 37:26)
imagine working there all day with that (37:23 - 37:27)
song (37:26 - 37:30)
song on (37:27 - 37:34)
Loop so this was one Hub and then the (37:30 - 37:37)
other Hub was at Soul Tower (37:34 - 37:40)
which sounded very exciting I'll get to (37:37 - 37:42)
there I went there last the other Hub (37:40 - 37:46)
was in I can't say it (37:42 - 37:49)
but uh my friend DMS who watches a lot (37:46 - 37:50)
on Twitch he's lived in Korea he's (37:49 - 37:52)
Canadian but he's lived in Korea for 12 (37:50 - 37:54)
years he teaches social studies you (37:52 - 37:56)
thought I was going to say he teaches (37:54 - 37:58)
English but he teaches social studies uh (37:56 - 38:00)
he's lived here for 12 years (37:58 - 38:04)
surprise surprise shocker um he took me (38:00 - 38:06)
to this place it was uh I don't remember (38:04 - 38:09)
what it's called but it's a it's a very (38:06 - 38:11)
touristy place that was the second Hub (38:09 - 38:13)
um and that had like a ton of little (38:11 - 38:16)
shops a lot of um just a lot of touristy (38:13 - 38:19)
things a lot of like handmade stuff over (38:16 - 38:22)
there uh so that was the second Hub same (38:19 - 38:23)
thing they were handing out hats they (38:22 - 38:25)
had Pikachu Eevee statue they had a (38:23 - 38:28)
bunch of banners and then the final Hub (38:25 - 38:30)
was near Soul Tower which if you don't (38:28 - 38:31)
know where Soul Tower is it's on top of (38:30 - 38:33)
a mountain so there's a couple ways to (38:31 - 38:36)
get on this mountain number one is you (38:33 - 38:38)
walk up it I don't know who in the (38:36 - 38:39)
entire universe is walking up that (38:38 - 38:42)
mountain especially after walking all (38:39 - 38:44)
day but you could walk of it number two (38:42 - 38:46)
is you could take the bus there were (38:44 - 38:48)
buses that would run from the bottom of (38:46 - 38:49)
the mountain to the top number three is (38:48 - 38:52)
you could take a cable car which I (38:49 - 38:55)
decided to do which sounded awesome (38:52 - 38:59)
until you realized that there was a beer (38:55 - 39:00)
event at the bottom of the mountain (38:59 - 39:02)
there was a wine event at the top of the (39:00 - 39:04)
mountain there was also a Pokemon event (39:02 - 39:05)
at the top of the mountain so everyone (39:04 - 39:07)
wanted to take the cable car which was (39:05 - 39:12)
only $111 round trip to do but we waited (39:07 - 39:14)
in line for an hour to take the cable (39:12 - 39:19)
car up to Soul mountain or Soul Tower um (39:14 - 39:21)
and then when you were up there there (39:19 - 39:25)
was the last Hub which had a photo (39:21 - 39:28)
opportunity the Hat (39:25 - 39:31)
um the they had there was the only one (39:28 - 39:32)
with a Jigglypuff standy I don't know (39:31 - 39:34)
why every every place had Pikachu and (39:32 - 39:37)
Eevee and then my place had the starter (39:34 - 39:39)
Pokemon and then up there were Pikachu (39:37 - 39:41)
and Eevee and then just a random (39:39 - 39:43)
Jigglypuff (39:41 - 39:45)
statue Jigglypuff was not featured in (39:43 - 39:48)
this event at all so I'm not sure why (39:45 - 39:51)
there was a Jigglypuff statue but he was (39:48 - 39:55)
up there um and so like being up there (39:51 - 39:58)
was beautiful it was great obviously you (39:55 - 40:00)
see all of soul from up there I (39:58 - 40:01)
understand why they put it understood (40:00 - 40:05)
why they put it up there but like if (40:01 - 40:07)
there was more communication I would (40:05 - 40:10)
almost be like you would want to start (40:07 - 40:13)
up there and then work your way down cuz (40:10 - 40:15)
like that being the final place I (40:13 - 40:17)
decided to go was cool cuz I saw the (40:15 - 40:21)
sunset but also like out of your 8 Hour (40:17 - 40:23)
event you maybe don't want to wait an (40:21 - 40:25)
hour to go (40:23 - 40:27)
up (40:25 - 40:30)
was faster I have no clue you could have (40:27 - 40:32)
walked it you could have caught Pokemon (40:30 - 40:33)
while you made your way up there but you (40:32 - 40:35)
didn't have to start at any of the hubs (40:33 - 40:37)
right anyone could start anywhere cuz it (40:35 - 40:39)
was the city experience okay yeah you (40:37 - 40:42)
could you could start anywhere (40:39 - 40:46)
um the coolest thing they did and this (40:42 - 40:48)
might have been the coolest thing (40:46 - 40:50)
Niantic has ever done this is High (40:48 - 40:52)
Praise I'm about to give I'm going to (40:50 - 40:54)
complain after this don't (40:52 - 40:59)
worry they actually mapped out the (40:54 - 41:04)
city with the EV stops in a way (40:59 - 41:07)
where you would follow it as a tourist (41:04 - 41:10)
and enjoy your entire route but they did (41:07 - 41:13)
it so clever where they didn't exactly (41:10 - 41:16)
tell you where to go but anytime okay so (41:13 - 41:18)
they they had these Poké stops that had (41:16 - 41:21)
flowers underneath them and those were (41:18 - 41:23)
the Eevee stops and so at any of the (41:21 - 41:26)
hubs you would see the flower Eevee and (41:23 - 41:28)
when you walked to that one you would (41:26 - 41:33)
then see the next one or the next two so (41:28 - 41:36)
it encouraged you to walk from flower to (41:33 - 41:39)
flower and when you walked it so we (41:36 - 41:41)
started at the hotel right and the first (41:39 - 41:44)
flower was the start of this huge River (41:41 - 41:46)
that's very touristy and they had you (41:44 - 41:48)
walk down the entire river which you (41:46 - 41:51)
would do as a tourist like if you're (41:48 - 41:53)
going coming to Soul you would want to (41:51 - 41:55)
do that river walk walk and then when (41:53 - 41:57)
you got out of that River it took you to (41:55 - 42:00)
like a shrine and then you do the you (41:57 - 42:02)
did the shrine and then the next one was (42:00 - 42:05)
where like they signed the Declaration (42:02 - 42:08)
of like Independence for like Korea (42:05 - 42:10)
where they like put the Korea law into (42:08 - 42:12)
place which you would do as well that's (42:10 - 42:14)
like a touristy spot and then the next (42:12 - 42:16)
one took you to the second Hub which was (42:14 - 42:19)
that huge shopping area where like (42:16 - 42:20)
that's where my friend took me he was (42:19 - 42:21)
like everyone should come here cuz it's (42:20 - 42:23)
really cool and that's where when I was (42:21 - 42:24)
coming back I was like I want to go back (42:23 - 42:26)
there cuz I there was more stuff there (42:24 - 42:28)
and then it would take you down to Soul (42:26 - 42:31)
Tower so it was like this huge almost (42:28 - 42:35)
like triangle of just like every like (42:31 - 42:37)
every time I was like oh I need to spin (42:35 - 42:39)
more stops okay I'm just going to go to (42:37 - 42:41)
that flower thing I'm not sure what's (42:39 - 42:42)
over there and I would get there and I (42:41 - 42:43)
was like oh my gosh this is where I was (42:42 - 42:46)
a year ago like this this makes sense (42:43 - 42:48)
like the it was so it was like it's kind (42:46 - 42:49)
of hard to explain but like when you're (42:48 - 42:52)
in a city and you're doing the touristy (42:49 - 42:53)
things and the flowers are guiding you (42:52 - 42:56)
there and you realize what's happening (42:53 - 42:58)
you're like yes when you're in a city (42:56 - 43:00)
and the flowers are guiding you (42:58 - 43:04)
there you're like but but like you would (43:00 - 43:06)
be do the the coolest thing is like you (43:04 - 43:08)
would be doing that stuff anyways like (43:06 - 43:10)
you're like if if this event didn't (43:08 - 43:12)
exist these are where I would be it just (43:10 - 43:14)
happens that (43:12 - 43:17)
like like it it's very clear that the (43:14 - 43:20)
whatever employee at Niantic did this (43:17 - 43:23)
they thought about it and and they had (43:20 - 43:25)
someone who knew the city yes they had (43:23 - 43:27)
somebody that knew the city and they (43:25 - 43:29)
told whatever Executives at Niantic this (43:27 - 43:32)
is what I want to do and they were (43:29 - 43:36)
approved and so I hope that there is (43:32 - 43:39)
some Niantic employee that is very (43:36 - 43:41)
familiar with (43:39 - 43:43)
Barcelona that's doing the same thing (43:41 - 43:46)
that is doing the same thing cuz like as (43:43 - 43:47)
an (43:46 - 43:49)
exploration (43:47 - 43:54)
event it was perfect like they did it so (43:49 - 43:56)
well okay here's the complaint oh no (43:54 - 43:57)
hold on before you get into the (43:56 - 44:01)
complaint I have a very important (43:57 - 44:04)
question how accurate as the American (44:01 - 44:08)
Korean corn dog the corn (44:04 - 44:12)
dog um I got my corn dog was a little (44:08 - 44:16)
cold so ours are better USA yeah yeah (44:12 - 44:18)
yeah she she really did me dirty when I (44:16 - 44:21)
ordered that cor dog was like 3,500 W (44:18 - 44:23)
which is like (44:21 - 44:26)
$280 she did me dirty and she gave me a (44:23 - 44:27)
cold corn dog probably cuz she knew I (44:26 - 44:31)
was American she did me she did me it it (44:27 - 44:32)
was it was not she could put more (44:31 - 44:34)
ketchup on it (44:32 - 44:37)
too I was really disappointed with my CT (44:34 - 44:41)
dog um okay the complaint is they (44:37 - 44:45)
advertised safari hat Eevee they're like (44:41 - 44:48)
no hat Pikachu's this event you're going (44:45 - 44:50)
to get safari hat (44:48 - 44:53)
Eevee with all its evolutions and all of (44:50 - 44:56)
the shinies all with a brand new hat (44:53 - 44:58)
yeah yeah and my thought process coming (44:56 - 45:00)
in is like I don't care about skadoo I (44:58 - 45:03)
don't care about Electabuzz I don't care (45:00 - 45:04)
about Vulpix I don't know what what else (45:03 - 45:07)
responding Den I do care about Den I'm (45:04 - 45:09)
just going to go hard for Eevees I'm (45:07 - 45:11)
going to come back I'm going to be like (45:09 - 45:14)
the Minneapolis hero everyone is going (45:11 - 45:19)
to want shiny saari hat Eevee I'm going (45:14 - 45:21)
to get as many as I can I want like (45:19 - 45:24)
eight for myself to evolve I want them (45:21 - 45:28)
to be shiny I want have trade (45:24 - 45:31)
fodder this was not advertised at all (45:28 - 45:33)
the Poké stops I just talked about the (45:31 - 45:34)
ones with the little flowers that guided (45:33 - 45:37)
you through the city those if you spun (45:34 - 45:40)
them checked off a checklist in your (45:37 - 45:45)
today View and it was spin one Poké stop (45:40 - 45:48)
spin two Poké stops spin three so you (45:45 - 45:51)
could only get seven of those Eevees (45:48 - 45:54)
they did not spawn in the wild there was (45:51 - 45:57)
no EES running around so so in total you (45:54 - 45:59)
got one Eevee to introduce you to the (45:57 - 46:02)
event you got the seven that you would (45:59 - 46:04)
spin each day if you decide to do two (46:02 - 46:07)
days and then you would get one for (46:04 - 46:10)
completing the seven so in all you got (46:07 - 46:12)
nine the first day and then eight the (46:10 - 46:15)
second day that was it you got no more (46:12 - 46:19)
EES for the whole event so this thing (46:15 - 46:21)
that everyone wanted like I want to get (46:19 - 46:23)
as many Eevees as possible cuz I want (46:21 - 46:27)
all the shinies you were limited to8 18 (46:23 - 46:31)
if you got or sorry not 18 um like 16 16 (46:27 - 46:35)
17 less than 20 for for the entire event (46:31 - 46:38)
but it was they like advertised that (46:35 - 46:40)
that was like the new cool thing like (46:38 - 46:42)
they didn't like falsely adverti cuz (46:40 - 46:44)
they didn't say it's still the new cool (46:42 - 46:47)
thing it's just way rarer than people (46:44 - 46:49)
expect it yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm (46:47 - 46:53)
surprised it wasn't in the wild that is (46:49 - 46:53)
like that is like a (46:54 - 47:00)
a weird and unfortunate signpost of (46:57 - 47:03)
things to come I'm surprised it wasn't (47:00 - 47:04)
in (47:03 - 47:07)
raids yeah they could have gotten raid (47:04 - 47:10)
money for that and like the the Snorlax (47:07 - 47:12)
with a hat was in raids but if somebody (47:10 - 47:14)
didn't have a ticket that remoted in (47:12 - 47:17)
they just wouldn't get a hat but yeah it (47:14 - 47:21)
wasn't in raids um it wasn't in the wild (47:17 - 47:23)
you could only get there was no I (47:21 - 47:26)
thought that you would spin the stop (47:23 - 47:28)
and it would give you like catch five (47:26 - 47:31)
Pokemon and then that would give you the (47:28 - 47:33)
Eevee so my so once I was like oh (47:31 - 47:35)
they're not in the wild oh there are (47:33 - 47:39)
Eevee stops cool there are like 70 stops (47:35 - 47:41)
in all of soul that have the Eevee (47:39 - 47:45)
flowers that's 70 opportunities to get (47:41 - 47:47)
Eevee that's what I and it was no it was (47:45 - 47:49)
they just gave (47:47 - 47:52)
you like it gave you the rewards were (47:49 - 47:55)
good it was like Den Heracross rare (47:52 - 47:58)
candy um like Pokemon you would you (47:55 - 47:59)
would (47:58 - 48:01)
want (47:59 - 48:03)
so yeah I (48:01 - 48:07)
think it was a good I I think this is (48:03 - 48:08)
the pro the way you do Safari Zone I (48:07 - 48:11)
think having hubs is smart I think M (48:08 - 48:13)
guiding you through the (48:11 - 48:17)
city is so much better than walking in a (48:13 - 48:19)
park all weekend doing routes the right (48:17 - 48:22)
way they're doing routes the right (48:19 - 48:24)
way (48:22 - 48:27)
like yeah I I think they absolutely (48:24 - 48:31)
nailed the city experience I think the (48:27 - 48:34)
maybe the shiny rate needs to come up a (48:31 - 48:38)
little bit May the the thing I was also (48:34 - 48:40)
I felt was (48:38 - 48:44)
like when you go to like a hoen tour or (48:40 - 48:46)
when you go to like a go Fest or when (48:44 - 48:47)
you go (48:46 - 48:49)
to um a community day no not a community (48:47 - 48:52)
day I would say like a ho and tour go (48:49 - 48:55)
Fest Old Safari Zone because they're in (48:52 - 48:58)
specific spots nian can curate that a (48:55 - 48:59)
little bit better we're going to add (48:58 - 49:02)
more Poké stops we're going to boost the (48:59 - 49:06)
spawns here um because it was the entire (49:02 - 49:11)
city it felt like oh I saw four spawns (49:06 - 49:13)
here last night at this Poké stop I'm (49:11 - 49:15)
seeing four spawns here today so it was (49:13 - 49:17)
like didn't they didn't like up the (49:15 - 49:20)
amount of Pokemon for ticket holders it (49:17 - 49:22)
was you know this area is really busy so (49:20 - 49:23)
it's going to get more spawns this area (49:22 - 49:26)
is not really busy so it I don't know (49:23 - 49:29)
how to describe that like this like the (49:26 - 49:32)
density felt not (49:29 - 49:35)
boosted it wasn't like having an incense (49:32 - 49:37)
on the whole time it was just normal (49:35 - 49:40)
amount of spawns yeah like obviously (49:37 - 49:41)
when you got to the hubs because the (49:40 - 49:44)
hubs were in densely populated spots (49:41 - 49:47)
there was a bunch of Pokemon there but (49:44 - 49:51)
sometimes you're like like from two (49:47 - 49:53)
shrines it was like oh there's not a lot (49:51 - 49:56)
of Pokemon here because there's not a (49:53 - 49:57)
lot of cell phone traffic here and (49:56 - 49:59)
there's not a lot of shops here so it's (49:57 - 50:01)
like ah you know kind of wish there was (49:59 - 50:03)
like two or three more Pokemon to click (50:01 - 50:06)
on while I'm moving between (50:03 - 50:08)
shrines uh so (50:06 - 50:10)
like I don't think there's a perfect (50:08 - 50:12)
solution to that (50:10 - 50:15)
but it did feel (50:12 - 50:19)
like I'm exploring soul but I'm also (50:15 - 50:21)
playing Pokemon (50:19 - 50:26)
versus I'm in a park walking in a circle (50:21 - 50:29)
playing Pokemon so like good and bad I (50:26 - 50:32)
don't think it's like (50:29 - 50:32)
worth traveling 10 plus hours to do I (50:33 - 50:38)
think I said exactly the same thing for (50:37 - 50:41)
goyang like if you're on the fence for (50:38 - 50:43)
like Barcelona and you live in the US (50:41 - 50:44)
again I don't know if it's worth (50:43 - 50:45)
traveling I think that's like an 8 hour (50:44 - 50:49)
flight for some people um but if you're (50:45 - 50:50)
close and it's like (50:49 - 50:53)
a like I think Mexico City is more (50:50 - 50:55)
obtainable like I think when I checked (50:53 - 50:56)
for a flight for Mexico City it was like (50:55 - 50:58)
600 bucks and it was like a 4-Hour (50:56 - 51:02)
flight round trip um which is probably (50:58 - 51:05)
cheaper than going to Seattle honestly (51:02 - 51:07)
uh like that felt like oh that would be (51:05 - 51:09)
a nice weekend (51:07 - 51:11)
trip um because you're still doing both (51:09 - 51:14)
at the same time (51:11 - 51:18)
assuming that they have somebody curate (51:14 - 51:20)
like they did for soul I (51:18 - 51:24)
know there are a couple Niantic Korean (51:20 - 51:26)
employees and I'm sure (51:24 - 51:29)
they curated that (51:26 - 51:29)
experience I will be interested to see (51:32 - 51:35)
if they're able to curate it for each of (51:34 - 51:37)
the Safari zones moving forward if that (51:35 - 51:41)
becomes a standard part of this event (51:37 - 51:43)
that makes Safari zones honestly much (51:41 - 51:47)
more interesting yeah yeah I think I (51:43 - 51:49)
think there was maybe an identity crisis (51:47 - 51:51)
with Safari zones of (51:49 - 51:55)
like okay like come to this area and (51:51 - 51:57)
hang out but also the shiny rate's not (51:55 - 52:02)
as good and it's not as like I think (51:57 - 52:04)
making them more different than a go (52:02 - 52:06)
Fest is only a good (52:04 - 52:08)
thing cuz if you're advertising like (52:06 - 52:11)
Safari's own soul or Safari's own goyang (52:08 - 52:14)
but it's only this specific part of (52:11 - 52:17)
goyang right like you're not really (52:14 - 52:20)
exploring the city plus like uh on like (52:17 - 52:22)
the technical side I'm assuming n can (52:20 - 52:23)
sell more (52:22 - 52:26)
tickets uh they don't have everyone (52:23 - 52:29)
focused in one place and have the tower (52:26 - 52:31)
disaster that they normally have when (52:29 - 52:35)
people are focused in one place yeah (52:31 - 52:39)
yeah I mean like as Petty as that tweet (52:35 - 52:41)
was for like hey if you don't have a (52:39 - 52:42)
ticket please don't come to this Las (52:41 - 52:44)
Vegas Park and then people were like (52:42 - 52:45)
well now I'm definitely going to come (52:44 - 52:48)
because Niantic told me not to it's like (52:45 - 52:50)
yeah but there's nothing there for you (52:48 - 52:53)
like you you can't see any (52:50 - 52:56)
spawns yeah yeah (52:53 - 53:01)
as that can be criticized uh it really (52:56 - 53:03)
meant well I (53:01 - 53:06)
guess it was kind of important for (53:03 - 53:07)
everyone (53:06 - 53:11)
involved like you're wasting your own (53:07 - 53:13)
time but you're also hurting the players (53:11 - 53:15)
are for everybody else (53:13 - 53:18)
yeah I don't know he word that it was (53:15 - 53:20)
very Petty though and there was a small (53:18 - 53:21)
part of me that's like I kind of like (53:20 - 53:24)
Petty n (53:21 - 53:24)
antic (53:24 - 53:30)
I mean um I I don't know that there that (53:26 - 53:32)
petty I think a lot of times people will (53:30 - 53:36)
read pettiness into the most basic of (53:32 - 53:39)
communications like there's like simply (53:36 - 53:41)
saying there is nothing here for you (53:39 - 53:43)
because you didn't buy a (53:41 - 53:46)
ticket is an exchange of actually the (53:43 - 53:49)
reality and people be like well how dare (53:46 - 53:52)
you how dare you tell me where I can I (53:49 - 53:55)
cannot go what is this all about it's (53:52 - 53:57)
like no literally there's nothing here (53:55 - 53:59)
for you this you can go to a place where (53:57 - 54:01)
you'll get better cell service and get (53:59 - 54:04)
the same spawns I mean you you'll get (54:01 - 54:06)
spawns if you're elsewhere you won't get (54:04 - 54:09)
spawns if you're there SP if you're here (54:06 - 54:11)
and people get (54:09 - 54:15)
like so mad about stating reality (54:11 - 54:19)
sometime because it's in print form and (54:15 - 54:20)
they're going to read it with whatever (54:19 - 54:24)
angry tone that they have it's like I (54:20 - 54:26)
can't make it next week oh oh you hate (54:24 - 54:30)
me like this is why I use lots of emojis (54:26 - 54:32)
this is why I Lots use lots of emojis in (54:30 - 54:34)
personal Communications because this why (54:32 - 54:37)
I don't because I (54:34 - 54:40)
like yeah that that Niantic tweet needed (54:37 - 54:41)
more (54:40 - 54:44)
emojis for sure it needed the cry eyes (54:41 - 54:48)
one and the hands and the oh yeah yeah (54:44 - 54:50)
yeah these don't hate (54:48 - 54:55)
us the the first day I I I think I tra (54:50 - 54:58)
Tred maybe with one person or maybe not (54:55 - 54:59)
at all I don't remember but that was my (54:58 - 55:01)
worry that's kind of like the the the (54:59 - 55:04)
bummer of the the city experience is you (55:01 - 55:07)
know you kind of have to stand at a hub (55:04 - 55:09)
if you want to do that kind of (55:07 - 55:11)
stuff uh because when people are are (55:09 - 55:13)
moving about it's it's a lot harder to (55:11 - 55:15)
tell who's playing Pokémon go or who's (55:13 - 55:16)
not because they're just like looking at (55:15 - 55:18)
their phone obviously the people with (55:16 - 55:19)
the Eevee or the Pikachu hats you can be (55:18 - 55:22)
like oh they're playing Pokemon go but (55:19 - 55:24)
when you're in like when you're when (55:22 - 55:27)
you're in like a Ark you know everyone (55:24 - 55:29)
there is playing right I mean when I was (55:27 - 55:31)
in New York I just looked for the yellow (55:29 - 55:34)
uh lanyard yellow wrist strap around (55:31 - 55:38)
people's wrists with the plus plus that (55:34 - 55:39)
was actually (55:38 - 55:44)
everywhere um but uh today this was the (55:39 - 55:47)
second day I I started at the hotel and (55:44 - 55:51)
then I I went through um like like I (55:47 - 55:52)
said I went through an area I didn't go (55:51 - 55:54)
through before and I did all that and (55:52 - 55:55)
then I came back to the hotel cuz there (55:54 - 55:57)
was a restaurant by the hotel and it had (55:55 - 55:59)
a huge line it was a breakfast (55:57 - 56:01)
restaurant had a huge line I was like it (55:59 - 56:02)
has to be good look how long this line (56:01 - 56:04)
is I came back there's no line I was (56:02 - 56:07)
like cool so I went in it was an egg (56:04 - 56:09)
sandwich they put cabbage on it that was (56:07 - 56:12)
not cool I took that off and then they (56:09 - 56:14)
they put they put corn in the rice which (56:12 - 56:17)
I don't know what Korea obsession with (56:14 - 56:19)
corn I was like whatever so they made (56:17 - 56:21)
the sandwich in front of me it was cool (56:19 - 56:23)
it was like this old Korean lady and she (56:21 - 56:26)
was just slamming sandwiches as quickly (56:23 - 56:28)
as possible so I get the sandwich I'm (56:26 - 56:30)
like perfect I missed breakfast I (56:28 - 56:31)
started Streamlight got the sandwich (56:30 - 56:34)
walked over and then uh like a Korean (56:31 - 56:35)
dude Taps me on the shoulder and he's (56:34 - 56:37)
like trade trade and I was like yeah (56:35 - 56:39)
cool he was like American I was like (56:37 - 56:41)
yeah I'm American and of course like I (56:39 - 56:42)
knew what was coming it was like first (56:41 - 56:44)
it was boulant I was like no I put up (56:42 - 56:47)
the little x x was like no don't out the (56:44 - 56:49)
boulant then it was like the Tauros no (56:47 - 56:51)
don't got the Tauros uh kfy you don't (56:49 - 56:54)
save enough things to trade I did no cuz (56:51 - 56:56)
I traded all of my boulant while I was (56:54 - 56:58)
in Japan and I haven't been to back to (56:56 - 57:01)
New York uh I I did I tell the story my (56:58 - 57:04)
last balant I traded to this little kid (57:01 - 57:06)
and he was probably five or six years (57:04 - 57:08)
old and his parents were walking they (57:06 - 57:11)
were leaving worlds he was like swinging (57:08 - 57:13)
but between them and he had uh he had (57:11 - 57:16)
like a notebook with him and there was a (57:13 - 57:18)
picture of a balant that he drew very (57:16 - 57:21)
poorly but I knew it was boulant and it (57:18 - 57:24)
was it said looking for and I was like (57:21 - 57:26)
oh man I have a bant (57:24 - 57:28)
and I ended up trading him a bant for (57:26 - 57:30)
like just like literally like a Scraggy (57:28 - 57:32)
or something he didn't have anything (57:30 - 57:33)
good cuz we've already talked about this (57:32 - 57:36)
children do not have good trades ever I (57:33 - 57:37)
was like I just want this kid to have a (57:36 - 57:40)
boulant he's like 5 years old he drew a (57:37 - 57:41)
picture of balant so I traded him the (57:40 - 57:44)
boulant and then his parents seemed way (57:41 - 57:48)
more excited than he was and then uh he (57:44 - 57:50)
and then he spoke no English the entire (57:48 - 57:51)
time and then as he was walking away he (57:50 - 57:54)
turned around and he said see you later (57:51 - 57:56)
in perfect Engish (57:54 - 57:58)
that was my last bant so I haven't been (57:56 - 58:01)
back to New York to stock up on bant um (57:58 - 58:03)
I had some (58:01 - 58:06)
Tauros uh so we went through like all (58:03 - 58:08)
the trades I don't even remember what I (58:06 - 58:10)
ended up trading this guy and then I (58:08 - 58:12)
turned around and there was a line of (58:10 - 58:14)
Korean people this is what happened in (58:12 - 58:17)
goyang one dude stops me for a trade and (58:14 - 58:19)
because I'm like one of the very few (58:17 - 58:21)
white dudes here I have a line of Korean (58:19 - 58:23)
people as I'm holding this sandwich I'm (58:21 - 58:26)
like I just want to eat love trading but (58:23 - 58:28)
this is like the worst timing in the (58:26 - 58:30)
entire world so then I went through like (58:28 - 58:33)
four people uh four or five people there (58:30 - 58:35)
was more people but I think when that (58:33 - 58:36)
they they were overhearing me say like (58:35 - 58:38)
no I'm out of boulant no I don't have (58:36 - 58:41)
hucha they were like peering off but I (58:38 - 58:45)
ended up trading um three or four people (58:41 - 58:46)
and then I finally got to my sandwich it (58:45 - 58:50)
was cold um and then what was even crazy (58:46 - 58:53)
is I went back to the Hub at the very (58:50 - 58:55)
end of the day after 8 hours cuz my (58:53 - 58:57)
hotels there and one of the girls who (58:55 - 59:00)
traded with me earlier found me again (58:57 - 59:02)
and we did another trade together so (59:00 - 59:03)
that was kind of unreal that was just (59:02 - 59:06)
like like I went to go add her and she (59:03 - 59:07)
was like no we're already friends and I (59:06 - 59:10)
was like I don't remember 8 hours ago (59:07 - 59:12)
but she traded me a Slowpoke a shiny (59:10 - 59:15)
Slowpoke with a hat and she was awesome (59:12 - 59:18)
she was nice she was great uh and I (59:15 - 59:20)
don't even know what I I traded her but (59:18 - 59:22)
she was super excited to get whatever (59:20 - 59:27)
she she got um so the trading stuff (59:22 - 59:29)
worked out for me that's like one of my (59:27 - 59:31)
favorite things to do is to trade but (59:29 - 59:35)
like I it seemed harder without like (59:31 - 59:38)
just standing at a hub and like asking (59:35 - 59:41)
people the fact that there were hubs (59:38 - 59:43)
does help though the city experience in (59:41 - 59:45)
New York at go Fest in New York didn't (59:43 - 59:48)
have pubs like that and so the only real (59:45 - 59:50)
easy place to trade was in the park (59:48 - 59:53)
except it was a New York go Fest so the (59:50 - 59:54)
whole city was full of very obvious (59:53 - 59:57)
Pokémon training so there was that aside (59:54 - 60:00)
but the hubs help it sounds (59:57 - 60:04)
like yeah yeah I'm I I (60:00 - 60:08)
I would maybe like want one or two extra (60:04 - 60:12)
hubs um there were no charging stations (60:08 - 60:14)
there was (60:12 - 60:18)
no um like restrooms but (60:14 - 60:21)
like there were the obvious restrooms (60:18 - 60:23)
like there were restrooms there but not (60:21 - 60:25)
like porta potties or something ni antic (60:23 - 60:29)
put up um there were no team tents at (60:25 - 60:32)
all uh which the goyang location for (60:29 - 60:34)
Safari Zone did have Team (60:32 - 60:38)
tents um it was like kind of minimal (60:34 - 60:39)
when I say hubs it makes it sound like (60:38 - 60:41)
fancy there was just like a support tent (60:39 - 60:44)
a tent that handed out hats and then (60:41 - 60:47)
like a staff tent and then like a couple (60:44 - 60:49)
standies for picture opportunities and (60:47 - 60:52)
there was that photo bus at the my hotel (60:49 - 60:55)
and there was the photo opportunity on (60:52 - 60:57)
top of Soul Tower weren't there like (60:55 - 60:59)
posters and Banners on all of the (60:57 - 61:02)
buildings too though yeah yeah they (60:59 - 61:03)
there was some in your photos it sounded (61:02 - 61:05)
it looked like there was just sort of (61:03 - 61:08)
this area that was Pokemon covered yeah (61:05 - 61:10)
that was the second area that was like (61:08 - 61:12)
that little town area so there was like (61:10 - 61:14)
um I can't remember what the second area (61:12 - 61:17)
is called but the it had a courtyard and (61:14 - 61:19)
they decked out the courtyard with EV (61:17 - 61:22)
posters and Eevee designs but that was (61:19 - 61:25)
like their theme so I I kind of wish the (61:22 - 61:28)
areas were more different like they were (61:25 - 61:30)
different enough of like You' want to (61:28 - 61:32)
see them all but it was like also very (61:30 - 61:35)
easy for a person to like enjoy the (61:32 - 61:36)
whole experience without visiting any of (61:35 - 61:40)
the hubs also there was like 70 EV stops (61:36 - 61:43)
like to get you between stuff but once (61:40 - 61:45)
you hit seven they didn't really matter (61:43 - 61:48)
cuz they were just there to guide you um (61:45 - 61:51)
and then they did work with (61:48 - 61:54)
campfire so if you had trouble seeing (61:51 - 61:57)
where they were like anytime you were at (61:54 - 61:59)
a flower thing you could definitely see (61:57 - 62:02)
one two or three more flowers that you (61:59 - 62:04)
would walk to um but if you couldn't see (62:02 - 62:06)
it because of the cetti or because of (62:04 - 62:09)
accessibility purposes if you went to (62:06 - 62:10)
campfire you could zoom in and out and (62:09 - 62:12)
they were clearly labeled on campfire (62:10 - 62:16)
which was really nice um it was like a (62:12 - 62:18)
re like I had no problem seeing them in (62:16 - 62:21)
the in the go map but the night before (62:18 - 62:24)
you could like kind of scout out and (62:21 - 62:27)
like plan your way on campfire I'm not (62:24 - 62:28)
sure how many people ended up using (62:27 - 62:31)
campfire but I'm glad they did that cuz (62:28 - 62:33)
I could imagine somebody being like I (62:31 - 62:36)
can't see the next flower and I'm not (62:33 - 62:38)
sure which way to go that sounds really (62:36 - 62:40)
helpful did they just show up (62:38 - 62:43)
as how did they show up on campfire if (62:40 - 62:45)
there were stops and not gems they they (62:43 - 62:48)
showed up at like little like pink cubes (62:45 - 62:51)
um campire so they were very different (62:48 - 62:53)
than gyms so you could see them all like (62:51 - 62:54)
if you zoomed out there was just so many (62:53 - 62:55)
of them (62:54 - 62:58)
that's really helpful actually nice yeah (62:55 - 63:01)
it was it that was that was really cool (62:58 - 63:05)
so so yeah I I I think this is you know (63:01 - 63:09)
shiny rate aside or or Pokemon selection (63:05 - 63:11)
aside like I personally didn't find any (63:09 - 63:12)
of the Pokemon that exciting like a lot (63:11 - 63:17)
of gen one um you know things things I (63:12 - 63:19)
already had like all the unknown letters (63:17 - 63:20)
I think were probably exciting for some (63:19 - 63:22)
people but like I've been to so many (63:20 - 63:24)
events that unknowns are not exciting (63:22 - 63:27)
for me anymore that's just personal um (63:24 - 63:29)
but I think like Pokemon spawns aside (63:27 - 63:30)
like that's always going to be a (63:29 - 63:32)
preference shiny stuff that's always (63:30 - 63:33)
going to be (63:32 - 63:36)
R I can't really say too much negative (63:33 - 63:38)
about the event besides like I wish I (63:36 - 63:41)
had more Eevee (63:38 - 63:41)
opportunities (63:42 - 63:47)
like uh you could maybe say like uh (63:44 - 63:49)
maybe more exclusive raids or anything (63:47 - 63:53)
but like mtrace being its first or (63:49 - 63:55)
second weekend in Pokémon go was like (63:53 - 63:57)
exciting enough for me and guzzlord was (63:55 - 63:58)
a brand new shiny so that was exciting (63:57 - 64:00)
enough for me so like those two alone (63:58 - 64:02)
were were still (64:00 - 64:06)
like didn't make it feel like H here we (64:02 - 64:09)
go Lugia and ho oh (64:06 - 64:12)
again got all gen two double (64:09 - 64:16)
combo select all (64:12 - 64:18)
two so yeah and and again I think I (64:16 - 64:19)
think it's nice to have a city (64:18 - 64:22)
experience to be like what are we doing (64:19 - 64:24)
for lunch today oh we went to that food (64:22 - 64:26)
truck yesterday so I guess let's try (64:24 - 64:29)
this food truck did we did we talk about (64:26 - 64:33)
the show how uh in Vegas where um (64:29 - 64:35)
because it that Park was kind of not (64:33 - 64:38)
near anything they had like a bunch of (64:35 - 64:40)
food trucks but the food truck lines (64:38 - 64:43)
were so long there was a Subway across (64:40 - 64:44)
the street so I was like I'm just going (64:43 - 64:46)
to get Subway but the subway wasn't (64:44 - 64:49)
expecting this influx of people so they (64:46 - 64:51)
literally ran out of bread at this (64:49 - 64:52)
Subway during this event and they were (64:51 - 64:55)
like we won't have bread for like two (64:52 - 64:59)
hours so your option was Subway which (64:55 - 65:01)
had no bread for a period of time a (64:59 - 65:04)
McDonald's which was like a 20 minute (65:01 - 65:07)
walk from the park or food trucks those (65:04 - 65:10)
were like your only options in that area (65:07 - 65:12)
so having a city experience and being (65:10 - 65:16)
like there are unlimited restaurants we (65:12 - 65:18)
can go to unlimited restaurants (65:16 - 65:21)
unlimited B it's nice when Niantic (65:18 - 65:23)
doesn't have to be the provider for all (65:21 - 65:26)
of those things yeah (65:23 - 65:26)
and it also helps when you have a city (65:27 - 65:33)
experience you don't feel like oh I have (65:29 - 65:35)
to wake up and then take like an Uber 20 (65:33 - 65:37)
minutes I can just like wake up and (65:35 - 65:38)
start playing exactly where I am and (65:37 - 65:42)
work my way towards a hub versus the (65:38 - 65:45)
lasas through Boston yeah well again the (65:42 - 65:47)
Las Vegas thing was ho and tour her it (65:45 - 65:50)
wasn't a safari zone but the Las Vegas (65:47 - 65:52)
thing there was little to no public (65:50 - 65:54)
transportation there was a very tin tiny (65:52 - 65:56)
parking lot that if you did have a car (65:54 - 65:58)
you could park in and then it was like (65:56 - 66:03)
6:00 came the event ended and now 400 (65:58 - 66:04)
Ubers are trying to pick up all these (66:03 - 66:06)
people and trying to like get in and out (66:04 - 66:08)
of this parking lot and get people out (66:06 - 66:11)
cuz there and so of course in (66:08 - 66:15)
Soul tons of Transit everywhere also a (66:11 - 66:18)
super walkable city um so again in like (66:15 - 66:21)
the logistics of an (66:18 - 66:23)
event I don't think I've been so (66:21 - 66:26)
positive (66:23 - 66:26)
nitic uh but yeah good for them I think (66:27 - 66:32)
I think they they really killed it um (66:29 - 66:33)
there's just like a bunch of like little (66:32 - 66:36)
things of course of like uh I wish you (66:33 - 66:38)
could do five lucky trades like a little (66:36 - 66:41)
bit past the event cuz you know what if (66:38 - 66:43)
you're sitting down to dinner and you're (66:41 - 66:46)
like oh I I didn't use two of my trades (66:43 - 66:48)
like let's trade right now um so there (66:46 - 66:50)
just like little things like that that (66:48 - 66:52)
they they could just do better in (66:50 - 66:55)
general not specific to this event (66:52 - 66:57)
they're getting better with I think all (66:55 - 66:59)
of the inperson (66:57 - 67:02)
events it seems like just each of them (66:59 - 67:03)
continues (67:02 - 67:05)
improving that was that little dip for (67:03 - 67:08)
Vegas but you know there well yes but (67:05 - 67:10)
that was also the first in-person (67:08 - 67:14)
tour yeah yeah and I I don't know if (67:10 - 67:15)
they wanted to be more money grabby they (67:14 - 67:18)
could have put Eevee or something else (67:15 - 67:20)
in raids they didn't decide to do that (67:18 - 67:23)
but I'm sure if they needed to make (67:20 - 67:25)
Oodles of more money they could have (67:23 - 67:29)
just stuck something in it so I wonder (67:25 - 67:30)
if there's (67:29 - 67:33)
like unknown or feeling less (67:30 - 67:36)
special so let's make a new Pokemon feel (67:33 - 67:38)
special and we're going to make that (67:36 - 67:41)
Eevee with a (67:38 - 67:44)
hat maybe but also this seems very (67:41 - 67:46)
Safari Zone (67:44 - 67:49)
specific yeah so I wonder for now I (67:46 - 67:53)
wonder if it's like uh in 2 years the (67:49 - 67:55)
Eevee will be spawning in the wild but (67:53 - 67:57)
there will be a (67:55 - 67:59)
different Pokemon with a hat exclusive (67:57 - 68:03)
to stops got to keep it exciting somehow (67:59 - 68:06)
right you just rotate out the excitement (68:03 - 68:11)
um so yeah uh good event there's also um (68:06 - 68:12)
for everyone else there's a trick-or (68:11 - 68:14)
treat event I just wanted to bring that (68:12 - 68:16)
up um there (68:14 - 68:18)
are uh starting October you'll be able (68:16 - 68:21)
to purchase tricks of treat which I (68:18 - 68:22)
think is a new thing they're doing I (68:21 - 68:23)
don't think they've done anything like (68:22 - 68:26)
this before for $5 you'll be able to (68:23 - 68:29)
access bonus and a total of four ticket (68:26 - 68:32)
exclusive time research time research (68:29 - 68:34)
expires this is bad I think we're all in (68:32 - 68:35)
agreement that if you Bay for something (68:34 - 68:37)
it shouldn't just disappear but it can (68:35 - 68:40)
correct um this one's a little better in (68:37 - 68:42)
that the time to research doesn't expire (68:40 - 68:44)
until the end of the month yeah so it's (68:42 - 68:47)
at least longer but so the following (68:44 - 68:49)
bonuses will be available every single (68:47 - 68:51)
day from the moment you purchase the (68:49 - 68:55)
ticket to October 31st which is 1.5 (68:51 - 68:58)
additional XP for your first catch 1.5 (68:55 - 69:00)
additional starducks for your first (68:58 - 69:05)
catch um and then the first part is from (69:00 - 69:07)
now until the end of the month so you (69:05 - 69:10)
got time uh which (69:07 - 69:14)
is uh giving you three premium raid (69:10 - 69:18)

Mossy lur additional encounters with (69:20 - 69:25)
pump kaboo it keeps saying N More I (69:23 - 69:27)

third part will be October 19th through (69:27 - 69:32)

first part appears to be TMS and XP (69:51 - 69:59)
got it yeah the the (69:55 - 69:59)
surprise so yeah I I think if you're (69:59 - 70:06)
playing every day maybe it's worth $5 um (70:02 - 70:09)
I don't know it's (70:06 - 70:11)
tough It's not the worst $5 you'll ever (70:09 - 70:15)
spend on PO it's not it's not as good as (70:11 - 70:20)
sleep doing a free box every day for (70:15 - 70:23)
most of the Season uh but it is at least (70:20 - 70:25)
a daily thing for the month that's a (70:23 - 70:29)
little fun I don't know so they've got a (70:25 - 70:31)
lot of research going on right now which (70:29 - 70:33)
is very nice especially compared to the (70:31 - 70:35)
first half of the Year where there was (70:33 - 70:37)
almost no research to do and almost (70:35 - 70:40)
nothing to do for a lot of the time yeah (70:37 - 70:44)
most of n well who knows if we're going (70:40 - 70:46)
to get mimik Q this month (70:44 - 70:49)
but most of Ni Antics Halloween stuff is (70:46 - 70:53)
usually well received yes I really hope (70:49 - 70:55)
they change the map up again this (70:53 - 70:57)
year making the map all Halloween themed (70:55 - 71:00)
last year was wonderful yeah yeah yeah (70:57 - 71:03)
yeah so you know they're down 200 (71:00 - 71:04)
employees (71:03 - 71:09)

it doesn't take much to copy paste so (71:09 - 71:14)
that's true control C control V they (71:12 - 71:16)
learned it from Game (71:14 - 71:19)
Freak um yeah I didn't think I'd be so (71:16 - 71:21)
positive about Safari Zone but here we (71:19 - 71:25)
are uh minus the cost it was (71:21 - 71:27)
you traveling Soul the travel cost yeah (71:25 - 71:30)
theost are the travel cost when yeah I (71:27 - 71:33)
would not want to pay what I saw Niantic (71:30 - 71:35)
had to pay to get me out here so they (71:33 - 71:37)
also waited the last minute so that was (71:35 - 71:40)
that was on them that's that's on (71:37 - 71:42)
