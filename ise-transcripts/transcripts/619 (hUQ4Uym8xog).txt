[Music] (0:02 - 0:15)

episode of the Pokemon podcast it&#39;s (0:15 - 0:19)
super effective I&#39;m your host Steve with (0:17 - 0:20)
me is (0:19 - 0:23)
Bobby hey I uh actually got some sleep (0:20 - 0:26)
last night so my sleep score in Pokemon (0:23 - 0:28)
sleep was actually semide decent for (0:26 - 0:32)
once so perfect we brought a brand new (0:28 - 0:35)
sleeper onto this podcast this is our (0:32 - 0:36)
Pokemon sleep podcast that&#39;s all we talk (0:35 - 0:40)
about we brought Mr Mr Joe (0:36 - 0:42)
sarabe (0:40 - 0:44)
hello do people call you that Joe do (0:42 - 0:46)
they just skip your last name and they (0:44 - 0:47)
just go Mr Joe (0:46 - 0:50)
S that has been known to happen yeah but (0:47 - 0:54)
typically they go s Joe oh okay s Joe uh (0:50 - 0:56)
Joe you&#39;ve been on the show before we&#39;ve (0:54 - 0:57)
been trying to get you on the show every (0:56 - 0:59)
time we we see each other whether that&#39;s (0:57 - 1:01)
worlds or (0:59 - 1:03)
or some Pokemon event I&#39;m like come back (1:01 - 1:05)
on and you&#39;re like yeah and then it (1:03 - 1:06)
doesn&#39;t happen I then it never happens (1:05 - 1:09)
yeah it&#39;s been what seven (1:06 - 1:11)
years yeah it&#39;s been a long time I was (1:09 - 1:13)
in a whole different state when we last (1:11 - 1:15)
recorded but I I think we didn&#39;t even do (1:13 - 1:19)
video back then no no no we didn&#39;t do (1:15 - 1:21)
videos just audio uh for those who for (1:19 - 1:23)
the one person who doesn&#39;t know who you (1:21 - 1:26)
are listening to this podcast who are (1:23 - 1:29)
you right so I&#39;m Joe (1:26 - 1:34)
caby no I I&#39;m C Joe I run c.net which is (1:29 - 1:36)
one of the biggest Pokemon websites in (1:34 - 1:38)
the world and it&#39;s been going on for 25 (1:36 - 1:41)
years this year so yeah big 25 this year (1:38 - 1:44)
you doing anything special um there were (1:41 - 1:47)
plans but mental health hasn&#39;t been (1:44 - 1:49)
amazing this year but I&#39;ll try and (1:47 - 1:53)
figure something yeah yeah we&#39;re we&#39;re (1:49 - 1:54)
we&#39;re in a we&#39;re in a slow period (1:53 - 1:56)
because there is apparently no big (1:54 - 2:00)
Pokemon game this year and uh I guess I (1:56 - 2:02)
guess we&#39;ll talk to we&#39;ll talk about (2:00 - 2:05)
that a little bit later um last time we (2:02 - 2:07)
had you on it was just like an interview (2:05 - 2:11)
show and it felt very back and forth but (2:07 - 2:12)
I I think we we do have some stuff to (2:11 - 2:14)
talk about and I think this will feel (2:12 - 2:16)
more natural and more like a normal (2:14 - 2:18)
episode plus it&#39;s just not me grilling (2:16 - 2:22)
you for 90 minutes good (2:18 - 2:25)
uh so recently we we&#39;ve been starting (2:22 - 2:28)
with our Pokemon sleep check-in uh cuz (2:25 - 2:30)
that game unlike other Pokemon games (2:28 - 2:32)
have have in my opinion really good (2:30 - 2:34)
communication they&#39;re updating it pretty (2:32 - 2:38)
frequently how are you enjoying Pokemon (2:34 - 2:41)
sleep uh I I&#39;m enjoying it a lot um I (2:38 - 2:43)
wish I was getting more new stuff (2:41 - 2:44)
because it&#39;s now at the point where (2:43 - 2:46)
you&#39;re not getting many new sleep Styles (2:44 - 2:48)
in a week and it it&#39;s just the same (2:46 - 2:50)
stuff over and over and that gets a bit (2:48 - 2:52)
uh but yeah I&#39;m enjoying it I&#39;m getting (2:50 - 2:57)
good scores surprisingly and yeah (2:52 - 2:59)
haven&#39;t had a shiny in a while so that&#39;s (2:57 - 3:00)
a bit annoying (2:59 - 3:03)
[Laughter] (3:00 - 3:05)
Bobby you just started playing what like (3:03 - 3:08)
a month ago are you ready for when this (3:05 - 3:12)
podcast comes up ente week will be going (3:08 - 3:13)
but we&#39;re recording this right before (3:12 - 3:15)
ente week (3:13 - 3:18)
starts yeah I&#39;ve been playing for going (3:15 - 3:21)
on almost two months now um because I (3:18 - 3:22)
initially picked it up day one and I (3:21 - 3:24)
just it didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t have a good (3:22 - 3:26)
first experience so it took a while but (3:24 - 3:29)
um yeah been about six weeks now and I&#39;m (3:26 - 3:31)
also actually not getting many new sleep (3:29 - 3:32)
Styles right now either which is a (3:31 - 3:36)
little Annoying um um so you know (3:32 - 3:38)
there&#39;s that but yeah no all ready for (3:36 - 3:40)
all ready for a ente week uh now that I (3:38 - 3:43)
have a better understanding of how that (3:40 - 3:44)
all works since like my first week (3:43 - 3:47)
playing was the week before raicho week (3:44 - 3:50)
so I wasn&#39;t really sure what I was doing (3:47 - 3:52)
but you know now that I&#39;ve got an (3:50 - 3:53)
understanding and going through like (3:52 - 3:56)
fire week and everything was uh was good (3:53 - 4:00)
so just been prepping all of that Joe (3:56 - 4:02)
are you are here here&#39;s the questions (4:00 - 4:04)
we&#39;re grilling Joe with are you a whale (4:02 - 4:06)
in these games how much money have you (4:04 - 4:07)
spent in Pokemon (4:06 - 4:11)
sleep um I pleed for (4:07 - 4:11)
fifth no no no no um I don&#39;t put too (4:12 - 4:17)
much in um I don&#39;t really put much money (4:15 - 4:22)
into like Cafe mix or go anymore um but (4:17 - 4:24)
I do put some in periodically Masters I (4:22 - 4:28)
put money in I love Masters though so I (4:24 - 4:31)
I&#39;ll always enjoy that until (4:28 - 4:32)
if it falls apart then it falls apart (4:31 - 4:35)
but I do enjoy playing Masters and sleep (4:32 - 4:37)
I have been putting some money in and (4:35 - 4:40)
I&#39;m going to be doing that with ente (4:37 - 4:43)
week okay that&#39;s that&#39;s tough like I (4:40 - 4:44)
feel like sleep well we talked about (4:43 - 4:48)
this but like I feel like sleep&#39;s uh (4:44 - 4:51)
amounts for things are kind of all over (4:48 - 4:53)
the place like it&#39;s just a little (4:51 - 4:56)
different than um I would say with even (4:53 - 4:58)
Pokemon go which obvious I I spend way (4:56 - 5:01)
too much money on Pokemon go but I feel (4:58 - 5:04)
like it is easier to spend more money uh (5:01 - 5:06)
quicker in Pokemon sleep than a game (5:04 - 5:09)
like go yeah I can definitely agree with (5:06 - 5:12)
that I mean it&#39;s like a helper whistle (5:09 - 5:17)
is what 200 gems like for 81 pounds you (5:12 - 5:21)
get only like like what is it400 uh (5:17 - 5:25)
1400 gems 14,000 gems something like (5:21 - 5:26)
that (5:25 - 5:28)
yeah you&#39;re speaking in a currency I (5:26 - 5:31)
can&#39;t (5:28 - 5:34)
method I do know the The Good the good (5:31 - 5:36)
camp ticket which is probably the best (5:34 - 5:39)
thing you could spend money on is 500 (5:36 - 5:41)
gems but that&#39;s close to $10 which at (5:39 - 5:42)
that (5:41 - 5:45)
point that that be SP $10 a week that (5:42 - 5:48)
that does get big excessive yeah yeah I (5:45 - 5:49)
I&#39;m sure there are people listening that (5:48 - 5:52)
do spend $10 a week because they want (5:49 - 5:55)
good camp ticket every single week (5:52 - 5:56)
that&#39;s too rich for my blood I&#39;ve been (5:55 - 5:59)
holding back on it every time I use one (5:56 - 6:01)
at the end of the week week I&#39;m like oh (5:59 - 6:02)
I&#39;m just going to buy one for the next (6:01 - 6:05)
week cuz it&#39;s so good and then I really (6:02 - 6:07)
think like do I want to spend $10 this (6:05 - 6:09)
week in Pokemon sleep like no and then I (6:07 - 6:11)
end up going and spending it and go and (6:09 - 6:12)
it&#39;s like I should have just spent it (6:11 - 6:14)
and sleep you know what what&#39;s the (6:12 - 6:17)
difference uh do you use uh the the (6:14 - 6:22)
Pokeball plus plus um for sleep or you (6:17 - 6:24)
the keep the screen (6:22 - 6:27)
open um for me I need to use the go (6:24 - 6:30)
Plus+ because I need my phone open with (6:27 - 6:31)
notifications just in case some news (6:30 - 6:32)
drops in the middle of the night and (6:31 - 6:34)
things like that so I just stick the (6:32 - 6:36)
Pokémon go Plus+ on stick it under the (6:34 - 6:38)
pillow put something on top of the (6:36 - 6:40)
pillow so I don&#39;t roll on top of that (6:38 - 6:45)
specific spot and then I&#39;m good got (6:40 - 6:45)
it (6:45 - 6:50)
uh with with like pricing of other games (6:47 - 6:52)
I actually wrote down Cafe remix and I (6:50 - 6:55)
know I know people I know there&#39;s like (6:52 - 6:58)
Cafe remix is probably even less played (6:55 - 7:01)
than Pokemon sleep but it&#39;s existed for (6:58 - 7:04)
what four years (7:01 - 7:06)
now yes it&#39;s got its fourth anniversary (7:04 - 7:08)
next (7:06 - 7:10)
month uh so you po this is this is off (7:08 - 7:14)
sb.net uh Pokemon cafe I don&#39;t know if (7:10 - 7:17)
this a trustworthy Source Pokemon cafe (7:14 - 7:19)
remix has received a new update this (7:17 - 7:21)
update brings the game to (7:19 - 7:25)
4.8 and provides an event uh coming next (7:21 - 7:27)
coming in the coming month in addition (7:25 - 7:30)
that is a few changes to Pokemon Five (7:27 - 7:31)
Star (7:30 - 7:33)
skills uh and now you can see (7:31 - 7:35)
leaderboards and events have been edited (7:33 - 7:36)
so you can fully check out a players (7:35 - 7:37)
team (7:36 - 7:39)
levels (7:37 - 7:44)
um I think that Pokemon cafe remix I (7:39 - 7:46)
don&#39;t personally enjoy the game play (7:44 - 7:48)
this brings a lot of questions (7:46 - 7:51)
of you&#39;re forced to play this Joe (7:48 - 7:54)
because you need to report on it which (7:51 - 7:56)
also means you&#39;re maybe forced a little (7:54 - 8:00)
bit to give it money but Pokemon sleep (7:56 - 8:02)
kind of expensive I got the impression (8:00 - 8:03)
when I played for a couple days that (8:02 - 8:07)
Cafe remix was even more expensive um (8:03 - 8:10)
and money grabby as a game yeah it (8:07 - 8:12)
didn&#39;t used to be it used to be you&#39;d (8:10 - 8:15)
get like standard levels every week or (8:12 - 8:16)
two weeks and you could just play (8:15 - 8:18)
through those and just have a lot of fun (8:16 - 8:20)
but at some point about a year and a (8:18 - 8:22)
half ago it shifted a bit to become more (8:20 - 8:24)
event focused and with that you&#39;ve got (8:22 - 8:27)
to have like specific Pokemon and or (8:24 - 8:28)
specific outfits in order to help with (8:27 - 8:31)
the event and those outfits come in the (8:28 - 8:33)
delivery and that&#39;s basically the game&#39;s (8:31 - 8:37)
gure and unlike Pokemon Masters where (8:33 - 8:39)
you well like Pokemon Masters you&#39;ve got (8:37 - 8:42)
a Pity amount but the pity amount for (8:39 - 8:46)
this is so high you need 999 points for (8:42 - 8:50)
it and at that point it&#39;s (8:46 - 8:55)
3,000 3,000 30,000 golden acorns for 11 (8:50 - 9:00)
points and I think that&#39;s like $40 (8:55 - 9:00)
geez I I&#39;ll have to double check that (9:01 - 9:04)
price let me just double check that (9:03 - 9:06)
pricing just a (9:04 - 9:09)
second (9:06 - 9:12)
wow but yeah the fact that the the (9:09 - 9:14)
delivery points they don&#39;t carry (9:12 - 9:18)
over they don&#39;t in Masters either but (9:14 - 9:20)
because it&#39;s that high you&#39;re just not (9:18 - 9:24)
likely to get that unless you throw a (9:20 - 9:27)
lot of money in so out of all I used to (9:24 - 9:28)
be like oh yeah I&#39;m going to get all the (9:27 - 9:30)
Pokemon I&#39;m going to get all the outfits (9:28 - 9:32)
I won&#39;t put too much money in but I&#39;ll (9:30 - 9:34)
have enough to keep me going to keep me (9:32 - 9:36)
going on the coverage but then they (9:34 - 9:37)
started this and I was like yeah I&#39;m not (9:36 - 9:40)
doing but I&#39;m not collecting everything (9:37 - 9:42)
I&#39;m not insane well I am insane but I&#39;m (9:40 - 9:45)
not that insane (9:42 - 9:48)
yeah uh yeah the one thing about that (9:45 - 9:50)
game that got me away from playing it (9:48 - 9:53)
was I love doing the the puzzles and (9:50 - 9:54)
everything and actually playing the game (9:53 - 9:56)
is very fun but it felt like every time (9:54 - 9:58)
I clicked into something it was trying (9:56 - 10:00)
to get me to buy something so you were (9:58 - 10:03)
just constantly closing notifications (10:00 - 10:06)
and and you know of hey get this to get (10:03 - 10:08)
swabl hey get this to get Mew hey get (10:06 - 10:10)
this to get that and I I kind of got (10:08 - 10:13)
tired of half of it being let me close (10:10 - 10:15)
notifications and half of it actually (10:13 - 10:18)
being playing the game okay so I was a (10:15 - 10:21)
bit off with my estimates um it&#39;s about (10:18 - 10:25)
$20 for 30,000 but that&#39;s still a lot (10:21 - 10:29)
you&#39;d need like 99 times that in order (10:25 - 10:32)
to hit the pity level which is that&#39;s at (10:29 - 10:35)
least 14 days of good camp tickets (10:32 - 10:39)
that&#39;s that it&#39;s a half a month of good (10:35 - 10:39)
sleeping do you do you (10:40 - 10:45)
see what do you see the future of Cafe (10:43 - 10:47)
remix because out of all the mobile (10:45 - 10:49)
games that are existing here we have (10:47 - 10:51)
Pokémon go we have unite we have sleep (10:49 - 10:54)
we have uh pocket coming (10:51 - 10:58)
soon it it Masters uh it seems like Cafe (10:54 - 11:03)
remix is the ball out I think of all of (10:58 - 11:06)
the six mobile games having to cover six (11:03 - 11:08)
mobile games all at (11:06 - 11:11)
once um of the six I think it&#39;s the most (11:08 - 11:14)
likely to go (11:11 - 11:18)
next because otherwise it&#39;s (11:14 - 11:21)
just it doesn&#39;t get the engagement I (11:18 - 11:24)
mean on the site I&#39;m so honestly I&#39;m so (11:21 - 11:27)
proud of my Cafe remix section it it is (11:24 - 11:28)
the best (11:27 - 11:31)
on no one is documenting Cafe remix like (11:28 - 11:36)
you are no one else is covering it (11:31 - 11:38)
period (11:36 - 11:41)
but it&#39;s just the posts I post on it (11:38 - 11:43)
unless it&#39;s a poke a really like cool (11:41 - 11:45)
looking Pokemon in theart style the art (11:43 - 11:47)
sty is fantastic for posts I put on (11:45 - 11:49)
socials they just don&#39;t really do the (11:47 - 11:52)
numbers and people just aren&#39;t playing (11:49 - 11:54)
it I&#39;m not seeing people say oh yeah I (11:52 - 11:56)
got this with when the delivery goes (11:54 - 11:58)
because whenever I post Masters people (11:56 - 12:00)
start posting their pools in the repes (11:58 - 12:03)
but in Cafe remates don&#39;t get that at (12:00 - 12:06)
all yeah you could probably just tell (12:03 - 12:09)
General traffic of you know sleep is (12:06 - 12:11)
getting this many hits Cafe remix (12:09 - 12:12)
getting this many hits yeah that makes (12:11 - 12:14)
sense yeah my Pokemon sleep section&#39;s (12:12 - 12:17)
actually higher than my masters and I (12:14 - 12:19)
think even higher than go except for (12:17 - 12:22)
when a go event has just (12:19 - 12:28)
started wow yeah especially on Mondays (12:22 - 12:30)
yeah yeah (12:28 - 12:31)
seems that (12:30 - 12:33)
right I will say the the last time you (12:31 - 12:35)
were on the show Joe like seven years (12:33 - 12:37)
ago we&#39;ve obviously talked pretty (12:35 - 12:38)
frequently and we see each other at (12:37 - 12:41)
events but I think the thing I this I&#39;ve (12:38 - 12:43)
never told you this Joe this this is (12:41 - 12:46)
your I I I I&#39;ve complained about the way (12:43 - 12:50)
SB looks or about the way you you&#39;ve run (12:46 - 12:53)
things but I&#39;ve never I&#39;ve never given (12:50 - 12:54)
you this compliment and so let me give (12:53 - 12:57)
you this compliment when Animal Crossing (12:54 - 13:00)
new Leaf the switch one the one the co (12:57 - 13:03)
Animal Crossing when that came out there (13:00 - 13:06)
was so much misinformation about that (13:03 - 13:08)
game everywhere and people were saying (13:06 - 13:10)
like well in this Animal Crossing game (13:08 - 13:11)
it happened like this but that didn&#39;t (13:10 - 13:14)
translate to like okay just because it (13:11 - 13:15)
worked that way in an old game doesn&#39;t (13:14 - 13:17)
mean it works like that way and there (13:15 - 13:19)
were so many YouTube videos wrong so (13:17 - 13:21)
many articles wrong like people pulling (13:19 - 13:25)
from old games there was no Sarah be (13:21 - 13:28)
Crossing there was no Animal Crossing (13:25 - 13:32)
website that you could go to that had (13:28 - 13:34)
mostly accurate information like (13:32 - 13:35)
obviously when a new game comes out we (13:34 - 13:37)
might not know the mechanics like on day (13:35 - 13:39)
one but well eventually takes a while (13:37 - 13:42)
yeah right you&#39;re you&#39;re one man I don&#39;t (13:39 - 13:46)
expect even even then once you like cut (13:42 - 13:48)
when you get a feature like take the Lee (13:46 - 13:51)
Club in the blueberry Academy it&#39;s like (13:48 - 13:53)
youve narrowing down the mechanics on (13:51 - 13:56)
how it works and rather than going just (13:53 - 13:57)
oh yeah it works like this it&#39;s like (13:56 - 13:59)
look we got this I check for another (13:57 - 14:01)
person we get this check for another (13:59 - 14:02)
person get this so it&#39;s likely this and (14:01 - 14:05)
then we just fine tune it rather than we (14:02 - 14:06)
just say oh yeah it&#39;s this like some (14:05 - 14:08)
other sites (14:06 - 14:12)
do yeah so it really during during The (14:08 - 14:15)
Bleak period of Co really made me appre (14:12 - 14:19)
appre appreciate s more because like (14:15 - 14:21)
other games just don&#39;t have what you (14:19 - 14:23)
offer the Pokemon Community which is (14:21 - 14:24)
really (14:23 - 14:28)
nice thank you maybe there is an animal (14:24 - 14:30)
crossing site nowadays but that that (14:28 - 14:31)
that [ __ ] for me (14:30 - 14:33)
[Music] (14:31 - 14:37)
has has sailed (14:33 - 14:39)
um since we&#39;re talking about mobile (14:37 - 14:41)
games I didn&#39;t know that you were such a (14:39 - 14:44)
big Pokemon Masters fan and I think I (14:41 - 14:45)
think people would also say that Masters (14:44 - 14:48)
is also a little money grabby I mean (14:45 - 14:50)
it&#39;s a gcha game I mean that that&#39;s (14:48 - 14:52)
inherently money (14:50 - 14:55)
grabby and it took it took me a while to (14:52 - 14:56)
actually get into the mechanics of it it (14:55 - 14:59)
wasn&#39;t until I like first properly put (14:56 - 15:01)
money in when it was Signa suit red (14:59 - 15:04)
signos suit leaf and Signa suit blue (15:01 - 15:06)
that&#39;s when I first put money in and I (15:04 - 15:07)
was like you know what I&#39;m going to get (15:06 - 15:10)
these and that&#39;s when I managed to get a (15:07 - 15:12)
team and I started getting into the (15:10 - 15:14)
mechanics of it all and that that&#39;s just (15:12 - 15:17)
when it really started clicking for me (15:14 - 15:19)
and that&#39;s what I like about it like yes (15:17 - 15:22)
it&#39;s money grabber yes but you&#39;re not (15:19 - 15:25)
expected to get every single SN pair (15:22 - 15:26)
just but you have I would expect you (15:25 - 15:29)
have all of them I believe the fifth (15:26 - 15:37)
[Laughter] (15:29 - 15:37)
all right that&#39;s right but you you you (15:37 - 15:41)
actually enjoy like putting the battles (15:39 - 15:45)
together and doing the battles yeah like (15:41 - 15:46)
every week going through the battle (15:45 - 15:49)
arena at first I was like is this right (15:46 - 15:51)
but then but every week I get really (15:49 - 15:53)
into it I get the syn pairs to get the (15:51 - 15:57)
best boosts and I just really enjoy (15:53 - 16:00)
it how long how long has master has been (15:57 - 16:04)
out five years this year okay so it was (16:00 - 16:06)
it they did a year before a year before (16:04 - 16:09)
remix came out yeah (16:06 - 16:11)
okay and you you said your traffic on (16:09 - 16:15)
Masters is much better than Cafe remix (16:11 - 16:17)
yes yes it&#39;s decent enough especially (16:15 - 16:19)
when there&#39;s like a big event happening (16:17 - 16:22)
otherwise it&#39;s just Pokemon Masters and (16:19 - 16:23)
Pokémon go are what I post for most (16:22 - 16:25)
about on the site because there&#39;s always (16:23 - 16:27)
something going on with (16:25 - 16:31)
them so big it&#39;s like a constant stream (16:27 - 16:33)
with like smaller spikes rather than (16:31 - 16:38)
like a big spike every month or so yeah (16:33 - 16:40)
uh speaking of Pokemon go how is your (16:38 - 16:48)
avatar over there Joe um it looks right (16:40 - 16:48)
I&#39;m it looks (16:48 - 16:54)
fine okay yeah yours looks okay yours (16:51 - 16:56)
does look yeah yours looks (16:54 - 17:00)
good do you (16:56 - 17:02)
gosh it&#39;s such a loaded question to be (17:00 - 17:04)
to ask like what do you feel the state (17:02 - 17:09)
of go is for you right now oh oh oh oh (17:04 - 17:12)
well I&#39;m a positive person I always try (17:09 - 17:14)
to look for the positive in everything (17:12 - 17:16)
and people think that&#39;s me Shilling or (17:14 - 17:17)
what not but no I&#39;m just a positive (17:16 - 17:20)
person I I just like to dwell on the (17:17 - 17:22)
positive rather than the negative and (17:20 - 17:25)
Pokemon go it&#39;s fun to play Still it is (17:22 - 17:27)
still fun to play it&#39;s still fun to go (17:25 - 17:30)
out I&#39;m just not fond of the decisions (17:27 - 17:31)
that have been made over the last year (17:30 - 17:33)
and a half and like at the start of the (17:31 - 17:34)
year every single event had a paid (17:33 - 17:36)
ticket and that wasn&#39;t all right that (17:34 - 17:39)
was yeah not good I&#39;m glad they&#39;ve (17:36 - 17:40)
pulled back on (17:39 - 17:43)
that um the the new backgrounds in the (17:40 - 17:45)
wild yeah they&#39;re great I I actually (17:43 - 17:48)
enjoyed that enjoyed when they dropped (17:45 - 17:49)
here because they dropped here about a (17:48 - 17:51)
month before the global launch a month (17:49 - 17:54)
or two and so I was just out for a walk (17:51 - 17:56)
and I was like just checking them all (17:54 - 17:58)
out and I was like this is really cool (17:56 - 18:01)
this this is what we needed at the start (17:58 - 18:03)
and I think that&#39;s what a lot of the (18:01 - 18:06)
decisions in Pokémon go lately have been (18:03 - 18:08)
they&#39;ve basically been trying to Plate (18:06 - 18:12)
the remaining player base after the last (18:08 - 18:15)
couple of years where Niantic have kind (18:12 - 18:18)
of annoyed that player base (18:15 - 18:19)
considerably (18:18 - 18:24)
and is it working we&#39;ll (18:19 - 18:26)
see yeah I mean there was obviously that (18:24 - 18:29)
Big Marketing push of Kanto Pokemon (18:26 - 18:32)
new character model new backgrounds I (18:29 - 18:33)
understand the whole marketing of it (18:32 - 18:35)
like that is if you&#39;re trying to get new (18:33 - 18:39)
players Kanto is what you lean on for (18:35 - 18:42)
new players um you&#39;re not going to are (18:39 - 18:43)
you going to any of the go Fest this (18:42 - 18:47)
year Madrid Sendai um I might be yeah (18:43 - 18:50)
okay like I I guess when I when I think (18:47 - 18:52)
of (18:50 - 18:55)
like do you like Pokémon go enough to (18:52 - 18:58)
travel that is a pretty good indicator (18:55 - 19:00)
of whether you do actually enjoy the (18:58 - 19:02)
game or not because you&#39;re not (19:00 - 19:04)
only probably (19:02 - 19:07)
putting a couple dollars into the game (19:04 - 19:08)
the weekend you are playing but you have (19:07 - 19:12)
to get a plane and a hotel and and (19:08 - 19:15)
travel I mean my first Pokemon go event (19:12 - 19:17)
was the go Fest in Osaka last year but (19:15 - 19:20)
that was only really because I was there (19:17 - 19:24)
already yeah right yeah I remember the (19:20 - 19:27)
the very second go Fest it was in the it (19:24 - 19:29)
was in Lincoln Park the Lincoln Park (19:27 - 19:31)
Park area in Chicago and you were not (19:29 - 19:32)
there you you didn&#39;t go to any of the go (19:31 - 19:34)
Fest earlier and I remember I we were (19:32 - 19:36)
messaging back and forth cuz I was (19:34 - 19:38)
telling you like okay I&#39;m this part of (19:36 - 19:40)
the task and you were like updating (19:38 - 19:43)
Cy yeah I appreciate that did you feel (19:40 - 19:47)
like you like missed a big Pokemon event (19:43 - 19:49)
like is there a little bit of regret or (19:47 - 19:52)
like man I wish I could have gone I mean (19:49 - 19:54)
a little bit but like you said it&#39;s a (19:52 - 19:57)
lot of money it&#39;s not just the money in (19:54 - 19:58)
the game it&#39;s the flights and the (19:57 - 20:00)
flights cost a couple of thousand to get (19:58 - 20:02)
from here it&#39;s not not like in the US (20:00 - 20:05)
where you can just get a domestic flight (20:02 - 20:08)
this is like a long at least 10hour (20:05 - 20:10)
flight to go to a go Fest in America or (20:08 - 20:12)
14-hour flight to go to one in (20:10 - 20:16)
Japan yeah and it was only what (20:12 - 20:19)
2019 was the first one in Europe is that (20:16 - 20:21)
was that go first or was that just a (20:19 - 20:24)
safari zone Safari Zone maybe I think it (20:21 - 20:25)
was Safar Zone first but the one in (20:24 - 20:28)
Germany right yeah yeah and then so it&#39; (20:25 - 20:31)
be 22 which was the first go Fest in (20:28 - 20:34)
Europe which I didn&#39;t do and then the (20:31 - 20:36)
one which was in London that was the (20:34 - 20:38)
exact same weekend as Osaka so I can do (20:36 - 20:40)
that one (20:38 - 20:43)
right yeah that was a weird decision to (20:40 - 20:45)
have them be on the same date in (20:43 - 20:47)
different places like that definitely (20:45 - 20:49)
there were some people who did both they (20:47 - 20:52)
met they they did the first day of Osaka (20:49 - 20:54)
and then they flew to London and did the (20:52 - 20:56)
last day of London I&#39;m like are you mad (20:54 - 20:59)
are you insane (20:56 - 21:01)
you know as as many mistakes as Niantic (20:59 - 21:04)
makes there are still very hardcore (21:01 - 21:06)
dedicated players to that game yeahh (21:04 - 21:09)
yeah Fair all I have such a love a hate (21:06 - 21:11)
relationship with go because I do (21:09 - 21:14)
genuinely like it and then I think I (21:11 - 21:17)
think almost my like when when Niantic (21:14 - 21:19)
did the remote raid pass thing like to (21:17 - 21:22)
me I I totally understand why people (21:19 - 21:24)
were mad but like I only did maybe three (21:22 - 21:28)
four remote raids uh a week like not a (21:24 - 21:30)
whole lot like I tried to do the (21:28 - 21:32)
Wednesday night things in person where (21:30 - 21:34)
it was much cheaper and just faster to (21:32 - 21:37)
do um so I totally get like some of the (21:34 - 21:38)
the decision-making but I think what (21:37 - 21:40)
really elevated (21:38 - 21:44)
my distaste with Niantic was seeing how (21:40 - 21:46)
well select button (21:44 - 21:49)
communicates and when select button (21:46 - 21:51)
messes up select button is the developer (21:49 - 21:54)
of Pokemon sleep they&#39;re just so (21:51 - 21:55)
generous when they mess up they&#39;re like (21:54 - 21:58)
really sorry the raicho event didn&#39;t (21:55 - 22:01)
start off for six hours uh here&#39;s a free (21:58 - 22:03)
biscuit for here&#39;s a free incense and (22:01 - 22:05)
like a free biscuit for everyone like I (22:03 - 22:08)
feel like nian could get so much more (22:05 - 22:10)
Goodwill is one if they just apologized (22:08 - 22:12)
properly but also if they just (22:10 - 22:14)
compensated properly like their (22:12 - 22:16)
compensation is like here&#39;s five Great (22:14 - 22:20)
Balls like oh cool (22:16 - 22:24)
great well I think just you know um (22:20 - 22:26)
communication for one with Niantic has (22:24 - 22:28)
just never been never been great right (22:26 - 22:31)
and I mean I&#39;m even talking about ingame (22:28 - 22:32)
things like right now we have the um the (22:31 - 22:35)
coin the coin research going on the one (22:32 - 22:37)
that you pay $2 for and you get 280 (22:35 - 22:39)
coins at the end of the week at the end (22:37 - 22:42)
of the two weeks and um there was no (22:39 - 22:44)
communication like to start that it was (22:42 - 22:46)
starting I mean it would have been nice (22:44 - 22:47)
to get some kind of notification so that (22:46 - 22:50)
if you had accidentally kept your bag or (22:47 - 22:53)
your task list full for the first day (22:50 - 22:55)
that you wouldn&#39;t miss out on the first (22:53 - 22:57)
day of the coin research you know and it (22:55 - 22:59)
could have just been an in-game (22:57 - 23:01)
notification news something that&#39;s like (22:59 - 23:03)
hey this event&#39;s starting you know like (23:01 - 23:05)
make sure this is whatever and I just (23:03 - 23:07)
thought it was it&#39;s just so recent and I (23:05 - 23:10)
was just thinking about I paid $2 for (23:07 - 23:15)
this event to maybe get myself $280 back (23:10 - 23:17)
and you&#39;re not even going to remind (23:15 - 23:18)
anyone or say anything about the fact (23:17 - 23:20)
that the event is starting in Cas so (23:18 - 23:22)
that you don&#39;t miss out on some of the (23:20 - 23:25)
coins that I actually paid for yeah I (23:22 - 23:27)
mean that&#39;s one of the issues I have (23:25 - 23:29)
with all the paid tickets because all P (23:27 - 23:30)
tickets a timed research not special (23:29 - 23:34)
research and so it&#39;s like you pay for (23:30 - 23:36)
the ticket you pay for the research but (23:34 - 23:38)
then you have to get it done in like (23:36 - 23:42)
three days otherwise nothing and that&#39;s (23:38 - 23:44)
that&#39;s a bit exploitative it&#39;s like it (23:42 - 23:46)
is a bit getting into the fear of (23:44 - 23:48)
missing out it&#39;s like you&#39;ve got to do (23:46 - 23:50)
this now it&#39;s like not everyone can play (23:48 - 23:52)
Pokemon go every day it&#39;s like yeah you (23:50 - 23:54)
can say don&#39;t buy the ticket but they (23:52 - 23:57)
are pushing so many bonuses which used (23:54 - 23:59)
to be for free at the event into these (23:57 - 24:03)
tickets and it&#39;s just a (23:59 - 24:03)
bit I&#39;m not frilled with (24:04 - 24:10)
that agreed I think we saw a couple (24:07 - 24:13)
years ago that on the back end Niantic (24:10 - 24:15)
added a subscription model and they (24:13 - 24:16)
never turned it on or they never (24:15 - 24:19)
triggered it what would you feel if (24:16 - 24:21)
Pokemon go had like a subscription like (24:19 - 24:24)
Pokemon sleep or I guess basts has a (24:21 - 24:26)
subscription (24:24 - 24:28)
technically master has like the streak (24:26 - 24:32)
bonus yeah kind of consider that um it (24:28 - 24:33)
would depend what they do with it (24:32 - 24:35)
because Niantic have done the thing (24:33 - 24:37)
which certain social media platforms (24:35 - 24:39)
have done where you take stuff away (24:37 - 24:41)
which is free and you put that behind (24:39 - 24:43)
the payall and if they do that as a (24:41 - 24:45)
subscription service that&#39;s not great (24:43 - 24:46)
that&#39;s how you get your audience to (24:45 - 24:49)
resent you but if they like go in and (24:46 - 24:51)
they give proper stuff like this is an (24:49 - 24:54)
actual bonus you get a 100 pokeballs (24:51 - 24:57)
every week for something like that but (24:54 - 25:00)
that would be fine they just need to (24:57 - 25:01)
incentivize it if they&#39;re going to do it (25:00 - 25:04)
and just incentivize by giving not by (25:01 - 25:07)
taking is there is there something you (25:04 - 25:09)
would want to see in like a subscription (25:07 - 25:11)
for me it would be uh like a second (25:09 - 25:13)
permanent incubator permanent as long as (25:11 - 25:15)
you had like the subscription I mean (25:13 - 25:17)
that that is a good one I mean like (25:15 - 25:20)
Pokemon Masters has that technically (25:17 - 25:23)
with one of their streaks where just buy (25:20 - 25:26)
you get it for what three weeks I think (25:23 - 25:28)
so yeah the the incubator bonus or (25:26 - 25:31)
whatever incubator pass I (25:28 - 25:35)
think yeah incubators raid passes things (25:31 - 25:38)
like that just give people stuff and (25:35 - 25:41)
that&#39;s fantastic yeah for sure I was (25:38 - 25:42)
gonna say do you think Niantic could (25:41 - 25:45)
mess up even more to this to this point (25:42 - 25:48)
I mean the answer is yes but like I (25:45 - 25:50)
don&#39;t I don&#39;t think Pokemon go is going (25:48 - 25:56)
anywhere unlike Cafe remix uh no I (25:50 - 25:58)
mean it&#39;s not what it&#39;s not what it was (25:56 - 26:01)
it&#39;s like no longer this cultural icon I (25:58 - 26:04)
mean Pokemon go is responsible for the (26:01 - 26:07)
second Pokemon boom it is the reason (26:04 - 26:09)
Pokemon is as big as it is now and (26:07 - 26:12)
Pokemon just keeps growing now regard IR (26:09 - 26:14)
regardless of go and that&#39;s great but (26:12 - 26:18)
goes what gave it the kickart and what I (26:14 - 26:21)
mean it&#39;s like fair play Pokemon go is a (26:18 - 26:24)
good game when it&#39;s being a good (26:21 - 26:28)
game yeah sometimes nitic does a decent (26:24 - 26:30)
event and you&#39;re like wow I wish every (26:28 - 26:33)
event was like this yeah yeah yeah well (26:30 - 26:35)
you know part of the thing for me is so (26:33 - 26:37)
they had the um the Avatar update and (26:35 - 26:39)
then they did the encounter screens and (26:37 - 26:42)
then they did the AR update with the new (26:39 - 26:45)
gohost snapshot stuff and I was you know (26:42 - 26:47)
posting about the fact that the AR (26:45 - 26:49)
update has been so smooth using goost (26:47 - 26:51)
snapshot you know it&#39;s been wonderful (26:49 - 26:53)
these updates are great uh and I was (26:51 - 26:56)
almost celebrating the fact that an (26:53 - 26:58)
update happened without issues and (26:56 - 27:01)
people were like there&#39;s like there&#39;s (26:58 - 27:03)
something to that that&#39;s a problem like (27:01 - 27:04)
when you&#39;re celebrating that an update (27:03 - 27:08)
just worked is you know that&#39;s that&#39;s (27:04 - 27:11)
not great yeah I was talking about um (27:08 - 27:14)
with the incense day which is coming up (27:11 - 27:16)
at the end of this month it&#39;s the first (27:14 - 27:19)
instance of Garian Meow in the wild but (27:16 - 27:21)
it&#39;s technically it&#39;s not because at the (27:19 - 27:24)
world championships in 20122 it was (27:21 - 27:25)
spawning at like 5 minutes before the (27:24 - 27:27)
hour they had like a Garian form spawn (27:25 - 27:30)
and the non galarian Varian and I was (27:27 - 27:31)
speaking to a friend and he was like oh (27:30 - 27:33)
that was an error I was like no I don&#39;t (27:31 - 27:35)
think it was it&#39;s like well it&#39;s pretty (27:33 - 27:36)
telling but for two years I thought that (27:35 - 27:39)
was an error and I was like you do have (27:36 - 27:42)
a point there (27:39 - 27:42)
yeah I guess the I think the only mobile (27:43 - 27:48)
game we haven&#39;t talked about is Pokemon (27:45 - 27:52)
unite uh which is still also chugging (27:48 - 27:56)
along um I would say personally I I do (27:52 - 27:59)
enjoy playing unite but but (27:56 - 28:03)
I I really enjoy watching unite I think (27:59 - 28:04)
a lot more and I think their their (28:03 - 28:06)
tournament structure has been really (28:04 - 28:10)
good of just F (28:06 - 28:13)
like I think again maybe per personal (28:10 - 28:15)
experience I I I think sometimes I see (28:13 - 28:18)
why people struggle to watch the (28:15 - 28:20)
TCG especially if they&#39;ve never played (28:18 - 28:22)
it I think it&#39;s pretty easy to watch VGC (28:20 - 28:24)
like oh this Pokemon just used a big (28:22 - 28:26)
hammer to hit this Pokemon and now it (28:24 - 28:29)
doesn&#39;t have any health uh unit&#39;s like (28:26 - 28:31)
maybe a little bit more confusing but (28:29 - 28:33)
because it&#39;s so action-based it&#39;s still (28:31 - 28:36)
like enthralling to watch uh so anyways (28:33 - 28:39)
what are your thoughts Joe on unite and (28:36 - 28:42)
the state of that uh well I enjoy (28:39 - 28:44)
playing Pokemon unite most of the time (28:42 - 28:46)
until I&#39;m on the bottom Lane by myself (28:44 - 28:48)
whil there&#39;s four people coming down at (28:46 - 28:51)
me and I&#39;m like where is everyone and (28:48 - 28:53)
that&#39;s when I start getting swear and (28:51 - 28:54)
that&#39;s when I&#39;m like I hate this game (28:53 - 28:56)
and throw my (28:54 - 28:56)
controller but when when it&#39;s going well (28:57 - 29:01)
I really enjoy it and I love the (28:59 - 29:03)
holloware that they do I haven&#39;t really (29:01 - 29:05)
bought any because you know that is a (29:03 - 29:07)
bit expensive but I conceptually I love (29:05 - 29:10)
the holloware and I love about saying (29:07 - 29:13)
that Mr saraby doesn&#39;t have every piece (29:10 - 29:15)
of holloware in Pokemon (29:13 - 29:17)
unite do you want me to add up how much (29:15 - 29:19)
that would cost that&#39; be like two grand (29:17 - 29:25)
at least it would be it would be a lot (29:19 - 29:25)
yeah but yeah I I enjoy unite and (29:25 - 29:31)
I know a lot of people want them to do a (29:29 - 29:34)
lot more changes because they feel that (29:31 - 29:35)
the developers aren&#39;t necessarily (29:34 - 29:37)
listening in regards to like things (29:35 - 29:38)
which need nerfing things that need (29:37 - 29:41)
buffing but that there&#39;s monthly balance (29:38 - 29:43)
patches so they&#39;re doing they&#39;re doing (29:41 - 29:45)
what they think is right at the very (29:43 - 29:48)
least they&#39;re not being antagonistic (29:45 - 29:50)
towards Their audience and so I think (29:48 - 29:53)
it&#39;s doing well and you know it does (29:50 - 29:56)
does for numbers in Japan at the very (29:53 - 29:58)
least and Asia for especially (29:56 - 30:01)
competitive arm of it because I think (29:58 - 30:04)
that&#39;s really the focal point of unite (30:01 - 30:07)
to give it a competitive arm yeah I (30:04 - 30:08)
remember when unite came out there was (30:07 - 30:12)
there was discourse about whether like (30:08 - 30:15)
this game is is owned by 10cent this (30:12 - 30:17)
game is going to flop like we don&#39;t we (30:15 - 30:19)
don&#39;t want we don&#39;t want another MOA and (30:17 - 30:21)
my thought process was always like even (30:19 - 30:23)
if America doesn&#39;t care about this game (30:21 - 30:25)
at all and of course it&#39;s Americans who (30:23 - 30:27)
think like they&#39;re the most important (30:25 - 30:29)
person people in the ire world I was (30:27 - 30:31)
like even if this game flops in America (30:29 - 30:34)
like it would still do really well in (30:31 - 30:37)
Asia Japan Etc I even think that with (30:34 - 30:40)
Pokemon go like Pokemon go is such so (30:37 - 30:43)
ingrained in Japan like it&#39;s just (30:40 - 30:45)
everywhere there that like even if (30:43 - 30:48)
America gave up on Pokemon go or Pokemon (30:45 - 30:50)
unite it would still be fine for the (30:48 - 30:53)
most part because of Japan or Asia do (30:50 - 30:57)
you for like sarabe see like the where (30:53 - 30:59)
where your traffic is coming from like (30:57 - 31:03)
yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s quite so like maybe (30:59 - 31:05)
like Brazil is like really into Cafe (31:03 - 31:08)
remakes or like (31:05 - 31:11)
maybe I haven&#39;t looked that deep into it (31:08 - 31:13)
because with C of course the main series (31:11 - 31:15)
stuff&#39;s always on top and then it&#39;s (31:13 - 31:18)
whatever spin-off game is relevant at (31:15 - 31:19)
the (31:18 - 31:23)
time um but it does go us UK Canada (31:19 - 31:25)
Australia Brazil Japan&#39;s a bit way down (31:23 - 31:28)
there because that is a language barrier (31:25 - 31:31)
oh okay yeah language right but so you (31:28 - 31:32)
haven&#39;t you haven&#39;t thought about (31:31 - 31:34)
spinning up a Japanese version of sarabe (31:32 - 31:36)
like how Mr Beast translates all his (31:34 - 31:40)
YouTube videos I have honestly H but I (31:36 - 31:42)
don&#39;t have time for (31:40 - 31:44)
that even in this quiet year I don&#39;t (31:42 - 31:47)
have time for (31:44 - 31:47)
that but yeah uh Pokemon unite seems (31:49 - 31:54)
really solid like we don&#39;t we you don&#39;t (31:52 - 31:56)
think that game&#39;s going anywhere anytime (31:54 - 31:59)
soon not not anytime soon soon I think (31:56 - 32:01)
it&#39;ll keep going I think they need to (31:59 - 32:04)
add a couple more new stages now I mean (32:01 - 32:05)
the sky ruins have been around for two (32:04 - 32:07)
years now and we&#39;ve had nothing new so (32:05 - 32:10)
we need an injection of something new (32:07 - 32:13)
just to keep people who aren&#39;t the most (32:10 - 32:14)
competitive players to keep them (32:13 - 32:16)
interested because otherwise it&#39;s just (32:14 - 32:17)
the same stuff over and over with a new (32:16 - 32:20)
character every month or (32:17 - 32:24)
two all right well we we covered all the (32:20 - 32:25)
mobile games I think in about a half (32:24 - 32:28)
hour so let&#39;s take a quick break and (32:25 - 32:30)
then when we come back we&#39;re going to be (32:28 - 32:31)
talking about scarlet and violet cuz (32:30 - 32:34)
that game still is pumping out content (32:31 - 32:37)
and then uh Legends Za or wait how do (32:34 - 32:42)
you say it Joe z z a it is meant to be z (32:37 - 32:43)
a but I&#39;ve been told we have to (32:42 - 32:46)
pronounce it Za in the UK as (32:43 - 32:50)
well okay all right we will be right (32:46 - 32:54)
back and we are back from our break all (32:50 - 32:57)
right before we get to the legend Za the (32:54 - 32:59)
newest game that we don&#39;t know a whole (32:57 - 33:01)
lot about (32:59 - 33:05)
uh let&#39;s talk about scarlet and violet (33:01 - 33:06)
uh this (33:05 - 33:10)
game had a little bit of a you know some (33:06 - 33:12)
people love it some people hate it I (33:10 - 33:13)
guess you could say that about most (33:12 - 33:17)
Pokemon games but uh I I you (33:13 - 33:19)
know it&#39;s not the prettiest looking (33:17 - 33:23)
Pokemon game and sometimes (33:19 - 33:26)
you so sometimes you just randomly fall (33:23 - 33:29)
through the floor or like me yesterday (33:26 - 33:32)
just trying to make uh you know a a (33:29 - 33:34)
slushie from the kakami stand and your (33:32 - 33:37)
whole game locks up and (33:34 - 33:37)
freezes thank thank goodness I had autos (33:37 - 33:43)
saave on um Joe how did you feel overall (33:40 - 33:45)
we&#39;re we&#39;re a year and a half into (33:43 - 33:46)
scarlet and violet what what are your (33:45 - 33:49)
thoughts on you know this game oh get (33:46 - 33:52)
ready for your comment section to blow (33:49 - 33:54)
up um (33:52 - 33:57)
honestly I I wasn&#39;t sure until recently (33:54 - 33:59)
how I felt about it until I went back to (33:57 - 34:01)
some of the older games and then I was (33:59 - 34:04)
like you know I really really enjoy (34:01 - 34:06)
these games I mean yeah their (34:04 - 34:09)
performance is janky I mean no no one&#39;s (34:06 - 34:10)
denying that people say I deny that no (34:09 - 34:12)
one denies (34:10 - 34:15)
that If you deny that then I question if (34:12 - 34:16)
you&#39;re (34:15 - 34:21)
alive but as a game it&#39;s really fun it&#39;s (34:16 - 34:23)
got the best of Pokemon gameplay I mean (34:21 - 34:25)
there&#39;s still bits missing it&#39;s not (34:23 - 34:27)
perfect every game has its highs and its (34:25 - 34:28)
lows (34:27 - 34:30)
but I really enjoyed it especially with (34:28 - 34:31)
the DLC and it&#39;s got the best cast of (34:30 - 34:33)
characters of any Pokemon game in my (34:31 - 34:37)
opinion I I will fight for that (34:33 - 34:39)
constantly I I just haven&#39;t put these (34:37 - 34:43)
opinions out on socials because well I (34:39 - 34:46)
don&#39;t need that (34:43 - 34:50)
yeah yeah I would you would you say that (34:46 - 34:52)
they&#39;re your favorite do you have a (34:50 - 34:55)
favorite Pokemon game uh honestly I (34:52 - 34:56)
think it&#39;s scet Violet with a DLC right (34:55 - 34:59)
now okay and the DLC is maybe what (34:56 - 35:02)
changed your mind or like elevated it to (34:59 - 35:05)
the it it elevated it yeah I think I&#39;m (35:02 - 35:07)
still sort and (35:05 - 35:09)
shield (35:07 - 35:11)
uh yeah I I think I&#39;m still sword and (35:09 - 35:14)
shield I think the DLC did elevate it a (35:11 - 35:17)
bit more um but I I I got into (35:14 - 35:19)
competitive a lot with sword and shield (35:17 - 35:21)
so I did grow very fondly of like (35:19 - 35:24)
Dynamax and um just like every (35:21 - 35:26)
tournament they did of doubles and (35:24 - 35:29)
Players cup and all of that I tera&#39;s (35:26 - 35:33)
fine um it&#39;s okay gosh I I feel like I (35:29 - 35:35)
feel like for a lot of people and I&#39;ve (35:33 - 35:37)
I&#39;ve said this on the show and I&#39;ve said (35:35 - 35:38)
this on my twitch streams I feel like if (35:37 - 35:42)
scarlet and violet just ran at more than (35:38 - 35:45)
like 12 frames a second and you didn&#39;t (35:42 - 35:47)
just randomly like fall through the (35:45 - 35:50)
floor I think it would be a top three (35:47 - 35:52)
Pokemon game for a lot of people yeah (35:50 - 35:54)
yeah i&#39; I&#39;ve also been saying this a lot (35:52 - 35:57)
I truly believe that if it ran perfectly (35:54 - 36:00)
then it would be at the top and of most (35:57 - 36:01)
people&#39;s list and people would say that (36:00 - 36:04)
we&#39;re at a peak time of Pokémon but a (36:01 - 36:05)
lot of people just can&#39;t see beyond (36:04 - 36:09)
performance now I can because I am let&#39;s (36:05 - 36:11)
just say (36:09 - 36:13)
older so I&#39;ve been playing games since (36:11 - 36:15)
the (36:13 - 36:17)
80s and I&#39;ve been playing games with (36:15 - 36:19)
frame rates a lot worse than Scarlet (36:17 - 36:21)
Violet even on the Xbox 360 like like I (36:19 - 36:23)
always said I said I played through (36:21 - 36:25)
Assassin&#39;s Creed on the Xbox 360 I can (36:23 - 36:27)
play through this and people like oh so (36:25 - 36:29)
you&#39;re just dismissing the performance I (36:27 - 36:30)
said no I said I&#39;ve played through worse (36:29 - 36:33)
so this is fine I mean I I remember the (36:30 - 36:35)
HP bars in Diamond and Pearl I remember (36:33 - 36:37)
when you knocked out a chansy you could (36:35 - 36:39)
go into the other room make a sandwich (36:37 - 36:42)
come back and ch&#39;s HP would still be (36:39 - 36:46)
slowly going down yeah (36:42 - 36:48)
y there&#39;s just a lot of revisionist (36:46 - 36:50)
history about how Pokemon was back then (36:48 - 36:52)
I I see people say oh yeah Pokemon (36:50 - 36:55)
Coliseum and XD they were great for the (36:52 - 36:56)
3D models they brought so much life to (36:55 - 36:58)
it and like you weren&#39;t there people (36:56 - 37:01)
were complaining cuz they just took the (36:58 - 37:03)
Nintendo 64 models in animations from (37:01 - 37:04)
Pokemon Stadium and just put them in (37:03 - 37:06)
there and people were complaining (37:04 - 37:08)
heavily about that stop rewriting (37:06 - 37:13)
history y yeah like the uh was it the (37:08 - 37:15)
sword and shield sword and shield was (37:13 - 37:17)
the copy and paste era and then people (37:15 - 37:19)
would then bring up Gale of darkness and (37:17 - 37:21)
Coliseum and it was like how are you (37:19 - 37:22)
complaining about copy paste and sword (37:21 - 37:24)
and shield when Gale of darkness and (37:22 - 37:27)
Coliseum were literally copy and P (37:24 - 37:28)
exactly (37:27 - 37:31)
it&#39;s (37:28 - 37:31)
Madness um do you think we&#39;re getting (37:31 - 37:37)
like a third DLC or anything more or do (37:34 - 37:38)
you think when they say hey this is an (37:37 - 37:42)
epilogue we&#39;re we&#39;re done uh I think (37:38 - 37:43)
we&#39;re probably done now if there&#39;s going (37:42 - 37:45)
to be anything extra they probably would (37:43 - 37:47)
have done revealed that Pokemon day but (37:45 - 37:49)
that&#39;s just my personal opinion now now (37:47 - 37:50)
they&#39;re just moving on to Legends that (37:49 - 37:53)
day and putting the devs onto that and (37:50 - 37:55)
the inevitable gen 10 which would (37:53 - 37:56)
probably have been in development for (37:55 - 37:59)
two years by now at least so yeah what (37:56 - 38:01)
what do you think went wrong with (37:59 - 38:04)
scarlet and violet and the terms of (38:01 - 38:07)
performance because we have you know (38:04 - 38:09)
let&#39;s go Pikachu let&#39;s go Eevee ran (38:07 - 38:11)
pretty great sword and shield for better (38:09 - 38:13)
you know minus the tree stuff it it ran (38:11 - 38:16)
pretty (38:13 - 38:18)
good well the thing that a lot of people (38:16 - 38:22)
have seemingly continued to forget is (38:18 - 38:24)
Scarlet and violet was developed in Peak (38:22 - 38:26)
pandemic time that obviously had an (38:24 - 38:27)
effect they could have delayed it they (38:26 - 38:29)
probably should have delayed it because (38:27 - 38:32)
of that but it was developed in Peak (38:29 - 38:33)
pandemic time that covered like for most (38:32 - 38:35)
of that development that would have (38:33 - 38:37)
impacted it considerably and so that (38:35 - 38:39)
would have impacted how they work how (38:37 - 38:42)
they sort engine issues out and that&#39;s (38:39 - 38:44)
where the fundamental issue is with the (38:42 - 38:47)
engine because if it wasn&#39;t something so (38:44 - 38:48)
fundamental they would have patched it (38:47 - 38:50)
they of course they would have patched (38:48 - 38:51)
it because that they wouldn&#39;t want the (38:50 - 38:54)
bad press and because it&#39;s not patched (38:51 - 38:56)
and it has to be something fundamental (38:54 - 38:58)
they can&#39;t fix without going in from the (38:56 - 39:00)
ground up in yeah but that that&#39;s how I (38:58 - 39:03)
see it personally the the problem though (39:00 - 39:04)
and of course you know this is you know (39:03 - 39:06)
they delay it all of a sudden the anime (39:04 - 39:08)
is delayed the merch is delayed the TCG (39:06 - 39:13)
is delayed um has there been a time that (39:08 - 39:17)
they&#39;ve done this yes yes um originally (39:13 - 39:19)
Pokemon Diamond and power were set to (39:17 - 39:23)
release in um Autumn of 2005 it then got (39:19 - 39:25)
delayed and then you had the anime have (39:23 - 39:28)
the battlef frontier Arc and you had the (39:25 - 39:30)
road of diamond and power spin-off (39:28 - 39:34)
series which included Ranger troz and (39:30 - 39:36)
mystery dungeon and there have also been (39:34 - 39:38)
some other instances like the a of armor (39:36 - 39:39)
did actually get delayed because (39:38 - 39:41)
originally zerude was meant to be (39:39 - 39:46)
released on June 10 if I want to say but (39:41 - 39:48)
that would have needed the patch for y (39:46 - 39:51)
ofama to be able to get it so the ofama (39:48 - 39:53)
would have been out before that point (39:51 - 39:56)
now was still a small delay and I think (39:53 - 39:58)
the scarlet and violet DLC was delayed (39:56 - 40:01)
because if you push um teal mask and (39:58 - 40:03)
indigo disc forwards two months from (40:01 - 40:05)
where they were you would have had your (40:03 - 40:07)
um summer release and you would have had (40:05 - 40:09)
your like October release which is what (40:07 - 40:12)
it was with SW and shield yeah where and (40:09 - 40:14)
considering the teal mask is based on a (40:12 - 40:16)
Summer Festival It&#39;s Like You released (40:14 - 40:19)
it in Autumn (40:16 - 40:22)
right yeah yeah I can&#39;t you know just (40:19 - 40:25)
because they don&#39;t publicly say (40:22 - 40:27)
something is getting delayed does it (40:25 - 40:29)
mean that internally it&#39;s not delayed I (40:27 - 40:32)
think the one public thing they said was (40:29 - 40:35)
delayed was the TCG live was supposed to (40:32 - 40:37)
come out around the time of brilliant (40:35 - 40:39)
Diamond shining Pearl and then they just (40:37 - 40:42)
pushed it um but that was (40:39 - 40:44)
like I mean TCG live is more of an (40:42 - 40:46)
American product more of like a (40:44 - 40:48)
English-speaking (40:46 - 40:50)
product but yeah I mean I think (40:48 - 40:52)
brilliant ding uh brilliant Diamond (40:50 - 40:53)
shining Pearl and legends arus are (40:52 - 40:55)
another example because if you shift (40:53 - 40:57)
those forwards two months you&#39;d have (40:55 - 40:58)
bdsp at Diamond and Pearl&#39;s 15th (40:57 - 41:01)
anniversary and noin zus when the games (40:58 - 41:04)
would normally have come out so I think (41:01 - 41:07)
that did these delays do happen but you (41:04 - 41:10)
just don&#39;t know it right right yeah the (41:07 - 41:12)
the January release on Legends arus was (41:10 - 41:14)
definitely an odd one um I mean I (41:12 - 41:16)
appreciated it just getting at a (41:14 - 41:18)
different time that was cool and how it (41:16 - 41:20)
all worked but that was definitely a (41:18 - 41:22)
little bit of a weird one for sure I (41:20 - 41:25)
think that Legends would have outsold (41:22 - 41:28)
bdsp if it made that Christmas (41:25 - 41:33)
day release I think it already has but (41:28 - 41:35)
we need um some documentation to come (41:33 - 41:37)
out which typically comes out in August (41:35 - 41:39)
I think they said that they&#39;re not doing (41:37 - 41:41)
it right now but the latest numbers we (41:39 - 41:45)
have have bdsp at 15.06 million and (41:41 - 41:47)
Legends arus at 15 million so it&#39;s like (41:45 - 41:50)
it needs to sell 60,000 to beat bdsp and (41:47 - 41:52)
bdsp sales have gone off the cliff so I (41:50 - 41:54)
think it&#39;s happened by (41:52 - 41:57)
now yeah that&#39;s uh that&#39;s understandable (41:54 - 42:00)
let archus is is actually one of my (41:57 - 42:03)
favorite Pokemon games that was uh uh (42:00 - 42:05)
just I loved everything they did with (42:03 - 42:08)
that and just trying something a little (42:05 - 42:10)
different that I think seemed to work (42:08 - 42:14)
quite well yeah I (42:10 - 42:14)
agree again before we get to the Legends (42:15 - 42:23)
Za stuff there every single YouTuber (42:18 - 42:25)
Twitter clout (42:23 - 42:27)
Chaser content creator Jo already knows (42:25 - 42:30)
where I&#39;m going with this said that (42:27 - 42:33)
black and white remakes were coming they (42:30 - 42:36)
said that let&#39;s go Marill let&#39;s go dun (42:33 - 42:37)
sparse is (42:36 - 42:41)
coming not me I for the record I said we (42:37 - 42:42)
weren&#39;t getting game this year and that (42:41 - 42:44)
that that was my I&#39;ll put that in my (42:42 - 42:46)
LinkedIn profile my claim to fame I was (42:44 - 42:47)
right (42:46 - 42:51)
uh that none of that happened Joe (42:47 - 42:55)
Joe give me the answer what happened why (42:51 - 42:58)
where is the black and white Joe (42:55 - 43:00)
it&#39;s funny isn&#39;t it and you know when (42:58 - 43:03)
the legends of Day trailer came out and (43:00 - 43:05)
we soon as I realized this is Callos (43:03 - 43:08)
when got over Gen 6 Pokemon I just burst (43:05 - 43:11)
into laughter I was just cackling (43:08 - 43:13)
throughout the entire rest of the (43:11 - 43:14)
trailer (43:13 - 43:16)
because everyone had been saying it even (43:14 - 43:19)
the trust trustworthy people had been (43:16 - 43:21)
saying it and I&#39;m like this is just (43:19 - 43:26)
brilliant and I just loved every second (43:21 - 43:26)
yeah that&#39;s that was a that was (43:28 - 43:31)
definitely I was a little bit I will say (43:29 - 43:32)
I was a little bit bummed when I saw (43:31 - 43:34)
that trailer because my thoughts had (43:32 - 43:37)
been I mean my wish had been Legends (43:34 - 43:40)
alola that&#39;s in aan version and I was (43:37 - 43:42)
like you missed it by one generation you (43:40 - 43:43)
were so (43:42 - 43:49)
close I I I can only the small sense of (43:43 - 43:52)
like validity you have is like well ilka (43:49 - 43:54)
must be working on something else and if (43:52 - 43:56)
they&#39;ve done Diamond and Pearl remakes (43:54 - 43:57)
maybe they&#39;re doing black and white (43:56 - 43:58)
remakes (43:57 - 44:00)
uh that&#39;s a stretch of course but like (43:58 - 44:01)
you can kind of see a little bit of (44:00 - 44:02)
logic (44:01 - 44:05)
there is Ila doing (44:02 - 44:08)
anything I mean Ela maintains Pokemon (44:05 - 44:09)
home on (44:08 - 44:11)
mobile so they&#39;re not doing a very good (44:09 - 44:13)
job at (44:11 - 44:15)
[Laughter] (44:13 - 44:18)
that oh (44:15 - 44:21)
dear but I mean Ela did just release (44:18 - 44:25)
sandland with Bandy Namco and so it&#39;s (44:21 - 44:26)
not like they&#39;re not doing anything it&#39;s (44:25 - 44:29)
just they&#39;re not going to be a Pokémon (44:26 - 44:31)
studio and people seem to think oh yeah (44:29 - 44:33)
they did this so they&#39;re always going to (44:31 - 44:35)
do Pokémon games and that&#39;s not how it (44:33 - 44:39)
works at all right do you see Ila doing (44:35 - 44:41)
another Pokemon game like if if and when (44:39 - 44:42)
we get Black and White remix because (44:41 - 44:43)
we&#39;ll eventually get black and white (44:42 - 44:45)
we&#39;ll eventually get X and Y remix we&#39;ll (44:43 - 44:47)
eventually get Kanto remix again right (44:45 - 44:50)
like the Pokemon company loves Nostalgia (44:47 - 44:53)
they love cycling this so whether that&#39;s (44:50 - 44:55)
two years 5 years 10 (44:53 - 45:00)
years is Ila making that or like I mean (44:55 - 45:02)
I guess I guess what I&#39;m asking is like (45:00 - 45:04)
what is your perspective on ilka coming (45:02 - 45:07)
in making you know a main Series game (45:04 - 45:11)
and then putting it out there I think (45:07 - 45:13)
game freak has shown that they don&#39;t (45:11 - 45:14)
want (45:13 - 45:16)
remakes I think by doing Legend zarus (45:14 - 45:18)
and doing Legends Z they&#39;re showing they (45:16 - 45:22)
want to do new stuff new stuff in Old (45:18 - 45:25)
places whereas people just want the same (45:22 - 45:27)
stuff over and over again and I think (45:25 - 45:30)
that having a studio like ilar to do (45:27 - 45:34)
those here and there I think that that&#39;s (45:30 - 45:35)
possible whether it&#39;ll be ilar again (45:34 - 45:38)
after what happened with bdsp I don&#39;t (45:35 - 45:40)
know I don&#39;t know if they want to take (45:38 - 45:42)
that risk (45:40 - 45:45)
again are you saying it&#39;s ela&#39;s fault or (45:42 - 45:47)
are you saying maybe it&#39;s the Pokemon (45:45 - 45:52)
company&#39;s fault for rushing Ela I mean I (45:47 - 45:55)
mean cuz I I didn&#39;t play sandland I kind (45:52 - 45:56)
of wanted to play sandland just to see (45:55 - 45:58)
like I would like to see how another Ila (45:56 - 46:00)
game (45:58 - 46:02)
plays (46:00 - 46:06)
um it could be both both can be a fault (46:02 - 46:10)
to be honest yeah so up in the air of (46:06 - 46:13)
whether like Ila&#39;s doing black and white (46:10 - 46:16)
in we&#39;ll just have to wait and see won&#39;t (46:13 - 46:20)
we but now we&#39;ve got at least gen 10 so (46:16 - 46:22)
yeah but like what other Studios would (46:20 - 46:24)
even be willing to help I think the the (46:22 - 46:25)
one that stands out to me is Bandai (46:24 - 46:28)
Namco or Namco Bandai I like I don&#39;t (46:25 - 46:30)
remember the order you say it in uh (46:28 - 46:31)
they&#39;ve always been like really they&#39;ve (46:30 - 46:33)
always said positive things about the (46:31 - 46:34)
Pokemon company they said they would (46:33 - 46:36)
love to do another Pok tournament if (46:34 - 46:39)
they were allowed to new Pokemon Snap (46:36 - 46:43)
was very well received I myself I was (46:39 - 46:44)
like there&#39;s no way this game is going (46:43 - 46:46)
to be good like it&#39;s just how do you (46:44 - 46:48)
make a sequel the Pokemon Snap and they (46:46 - 46:51)
I think they did a fantastic job new (46:48 - 46:52)
Pokemon Snap is amazing we&#39;re still (46:51 - 46:55)
finding new interactions it&#39;s been 3 (46:52 - 46:57)
years we&#39;re still finding new on that&#39;s (46:55 - 47:00)
how indepth that game is and it&#39;s (46:57 - 47:05)
brilliant I want more yeah (47:00 - 47:05)
right so and and for the record because (47:06 - 47:11)
I do remember your tweets you&#39;re not the (47:10 - 47:13)
biggest fan of (47:11 - 47:17)
bdsp they are a game which exists (47:13 - 47:21)
yeah uh are there big fans of bdsp I&#39;ve (47:17 - 47:23)
never met one I&#39;m sure there are but (47:21 - 47:25)
I&#39;ve never met one I do know people who (47:23 - 47:28)
like bdsp I do question question if they (47:25 - 47:30)
or (47:28 - 47:30)
right why okay so before we get to Za uh (47:32 - 47:38)
and I guess there&#39;s still more I want to (47:37 - 47:39)
talk about for scarlet and violet why do (47:38 - 47:41)
you think there was only one version of (47:39 - 47:44)
Legends like if they if they if really (47:41 - 47:46)
they wanted to boost their sales they (47:44 - 47:48)
could have put out two they&#39;ve always (47:46 - 47:50)
put out two they could have had irida in (47:48 - 47:53)
one game uh oh gosh what&#39;s his name in (47:50 - 47:56)
the other game ad admin admin in the (47:53 - 47:59)
other I think initially they didn&#39;t (47:56 - 48:00)
intend to have trading hence why the (47:59 - 48:02)
linking cord&#39;s an item I think (48:00 - 48:03)
originally they weren&#39;t going to have (48:02 - 48:05)
trading at all I think they saw it as a (48:03 - 48:07)
single player experience and so with (48:05 - 48:09)
that they figured they&#39;re not going to (48:07 - 48:12)
do two versions and I know people say oh (48:09 - 48:14)
yeah they do two versions to make twice (48:12 - 48:16)
the money but that&#39;s not the case the (48:14 - 48:19)
analytics don&#39;t match up for that there (48:16 - 48:20)
are when people buy the double packs (48:19 - 48:23)
it&#39;s for like a sibling a partner or a (48:20 - 48:25)
family member or a friend rather than (48:23 - 48:27)
just oh yeah I&#39;m buying two it&#39;s just (48:25 - 48:29)
because we&#39;re in like the hardcore (48:27 - 48:31)
Pokemon Community we just see the small (48:29 - 48:34)
group of people who do do that and right (48:31 - 48:35)
because how Echo chamers work we just (48:34 - 48:37)
think that&#39;s how it (48:35 - 48:40)
is so it it wouldn&#39;t have boosted for (48:37 - 48:41)
sales that much it would have meant it (48:40 - 48:46)
beat bdsp earlier granted but I I don&#39;t (48:41 - 48:47)
think it would have boosted it that (48:46 - 48:50)
much do you do you think we&#39;re getting (48:47 - 48:54)
two versions of Za or no they&#39;re just (48:50 - 48:57)
going to do the one again yeah (48:54 - 49:02)
okay well we&#39;re here speaking of Za uh (48:57 - 49:05)
do do we think this is like a January (49:02 - 49:07)
game my opinion no (49:05 - 49:10)
but like we&#39;re getting no game this year (49:07 - 49:12)
as far as we know right unless unless (49:10 - 49:14)
there&#39;s a secret second Pokemon day that (49:12 - 49:15)
they&#39;re gonna surprise you with your (49:14 - 49:16)
black and white (49:15 - 49:20)
[Laughter] (49:16 - 49:20)
remakes um I think it I don&#39;t think (49:24 - 49:29)
they&#39; have revealed it if it was going (49:27 - 49:32)
to be late next year personally I I (49:29 - 49:34)
think they would have just thrown (49:32 - 49:36)
something else together in the Pokemon (49:34 - 49:38)
presents and just said yeah we got (49:36 - 49:40)
taking a year off yeah going to be fine (49:38 - 49:43)
here&#39;s some merch here some mobile stuff (49:40 - 49:44)
and that would have been fine I mean I (49:43 - 49:46)
know people think oh yeah mobile games (49:44 - 49:47)
are taking away time from Main Series (49:46 - 49:50)
games like that&#39;s not how it works right (49:47 - 49:54)
but I I think first half of next year (49:50 - 49:56)
obviously this is just my speculation (49:54 - 49:58)
sure I think first half of next year (49:56 - 50:01)
probably first quarter that it&#39;s January (49:58 - 50:03)
maybe poke one day maybe it&#39;ll be a (50:01 - 50:06)
pokon day release yeah I just I think of (50:03 - 50:08)
when they showed Legends so they showed (50:06 - 50:10)
bdsp on Pokemon day they showed Legends (50:08 - 50:15)
on Pokemon day Legends said early (50:10 - 50:19)
2022 was that the yeah and uh they (50:15 - 50:21)
didn&#39;t have any date here (50:19 - 50:25)
so I would think like Pokemon day 20 (50:21 - 50:28)
what year is it 2020 for Co is really (50:25 - 50:30)
thrown me off with years I would think (50:28 - 50:32)
early Pokemon day I would think Pokemon (50:30 - 50:35)
Day next year they show pretty much what (50:32 - 50:38)
the game is in totality and then whether (50:35 - 50:41)
that comes out in March April May that&#39;s (50:38 - 50:44)
where I see it coming um unless we get a (50:41 - 50:48)
trailer at Worlds but um personally I (50:44 - 50:50)
think um we&#39;re going to see it before (50:48 - 50:54)
that oh you do okay I do I think we&#39;re (50:50 - 50:56)
going to probably see it but typically (50:54 - 50:59)
since Pokemon&#39;s presents happened we&#39;ve (50:56 - 51:01)
had a Pokemon day one and one six months (50:59 - 51:02)
later in (51:01 - 51:04)
August and so I think we&#39;ll get an (51:02 - 51:07)
August present before worlds (51:04 - 51:10)
and maybe see it there get mobile games (51:07 - 51:13)
like Master&#39;s anniversary info next Go (51:10 - 51:16)
stuff things like that and I think we&#39;ll (51:13 - 51:19)
that&#39;s when we&#39;ll see legends z a p that (51:16 - 51:21)
that&#39;s just how I see it based on how (51:19 - 51:23)
the marketing has worked with Pokemon (51:21 - 51:25)
games I I&#39;ve been with this for a very (51:23 - 51:27)
long time (51:25 - 51:30)
I I I I can see how this tends to work (51:27 - 51:33)
and so I think we&#39;re gonna see it in a (51:30 - 51:34)
few (51:33 - 51:36)
months personally I hope so because you (51:34 - 51:39)
know need something new to you know kick (51:36 - 51:40)
the (51:39 - 51:43)
discourse yeah yeah that makes sense (51:40 - 51:45)
because I because I was thinking along (51:43 - 51:47)
the same lines I was thinking we get a (51:45 - 51:51)
late January release on Za and then (51:47 - 51:54)
Pokemon day they&#39;ll talk about whatever (51:51 - 51:56)
potential November thing is going to (51:54 - 51:57)
happen you know and that was I guess (51:56 - 51:59)
that&#39;s sort sort of what happened in (51:57 - 52:02)
2022 right cuz we had archus in January (51:59 - 52:05)
then we got the um we got Scarlet Violet (52:02 - 52:09)
information in Pokemon day of 2022 so I (52:05 - 52:11)
could see something uh similar to that (52:09 - 52:14)
happening yeah I I could definitely see (52:11 - 52:16)
that I mean if they still somehow follow (52:14 - 52:18)
the threeyear cycle in gen 10 is June (52:16 - 52:20)
next (52:18 - 52:24)
year and that&#39;s a scary thought do but (52:20 - 52:26)
the the other speculation is they they (52:24 - 52:28)
save gen 10 for the 30th Anniversary (52:26 - 52:32)
which is one more year yeah but then you (52:28 - 52:34)
just have to think of it like this like (52:32 - 52:37)
do you want the game out to be out (52:34 - 52:39)
whilst the 30th Anniversary happens or (52:37 - 52:41)
do you want it to come out at the end of (52:39 - 52:45)
the 30th anniversary year and that&#39;s (52:41 - 52:46)
really where you have to think how (52:45 - 52:49)
they&#39;re going to go about it because (52:46 - 52:53)
either way is a good option to be honest (52:49 - 52:56)
yeah yeah plus plus they get kind of get (52:53 - 52:58)
two celebration if you do gen 10 one (52:56 - 53:00)
year and then the 30th Anniversary the (52:58 - 53:02)
following you got you got two separate (53:00 - 53:04)
celebrations and yeah can you know do (53:02 - 53:06)
stuff with (53:04 - 53:09)
that so so you think the the game plan (53:06 - 53:12)
is you you get this Legends game early (53:09 - 53:16)
next year and then we get an gen 10 late (53:12 - 53:20)
next year I mean I I don&#39;t want to (53:16 - 53:22)
speculate too much especially since (53:20 - 53:24)
people take my speculation as facts a (53:22 - 53:27)
lot no no cuz I&#39;ve I&#39;ve speculated (53:24 - 53:28)
before too but I I think there&#39;s a (53:27 - 53:30)
difference between US just openly (53:28 - 53:32)
talking about what we think versus like (53:30 - 53:35)
people on Twitter being like next year (53:32 - 53:37)
black and white with like no go I see (53:35 - 53:40)
that way too much it&#39;s like come on come (53:37 - 53:44)
on stop this um I like personally even (53:40 - 53:46)
if it&#39;s just for Optics I hope they take (53:44 - 53:49)
an extra year for Gen 10 yeah yeah yeah (53:46 - 53:52)
be because even though the pandemic (53:49 - 53:55)
obviously damaged scarlet and violets D (53:52 - 53:57)
development people think oh you need to (53:55 - 53:59)
take more time and so give them more the (53:57 - 54:01)
more time even if they don&#39;t need it (53:59 - 54:02)
give it to (54:01 - 54:05)
them yeah that&#39;s just how I see (54:02 - 54:08)
it yeah I definitely agree do we do we (54:05 - 54:10)
see though like does does like a a gen (54:08 - 54:12)
10 or a gen 11 or whatever do they need (54:10 - 54:14)
to come out in November because if I (54:12 - 54:17)
remember correctly black and white at (54:14 - 54:20)
least in the US came out in March or (54:17 - 54:23)
April right so history time with Joe (54:20 - 54:25)
here we go (54:23 - 54:28)
perfect right so one obviously that was (54:25 - 54:31)
February and Gen 2 was in November uh (54:28 - 54:34)
yellow was in September uh Crystal was (54:31 - 54:37)
in December rubian Sapphire was also in (54:34 - 54:39)
November Fire Red Leaf Green was in (54:37 - 54:40)
January Emerald was in September diamond (54:39 - 54:42)
and power was in September Platinum was (54:40 - 54:44)
in September hotard Soul Silver was in (54:42 - 54:46)
September black and white was in (54:44 - 54:47)
September black two and white two was in (54:46 - 54:49)
June X and Y was in October and then (54:47 - 54:52)
it&#39;s been November ever since I think (54:49 - 54:54)
the reason why it&#39;s November is because (54:52 - 54:56)
it shifted to a worldwide launch now and (54:54 - 54:58)
the November period is the biggest (54:56 - 55:01)
shopping period in the west you&#39;ve got (54:58 - 55:02)
your Black Friday even though black (55:01 - 55:05)
Friday&#39;s kind of gone off a bit now you (55:02 - 55:07)
still have people doing the purchasing (55:05 - 55:09)
for Christmas and so I think that&#39;s (55:07 - 55:12)
always going to be the target time for a (55:09 - 55:14)
Pokemon game now and that that&#39;s mostly (55:12 - 55:16)
the target time for most big Nintendo (55:14 - 55:18)
releases as well I mean yeah granted we (55:16 - 55:19)
had breath of the wild and tiit of (55:18 - 55:22)
kingdom in the spring but for the big (55:19 - 55:25)
temp Poole releases like Mario Odyssey (55:22 - 55:26)
and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s other ones like (55:25 - 55:27)
I&#39;ve (55:26 - 55:29)
forgotten but even you see like Call of (55:27 - 55:32)
Duty coming out in November yeah yeah (55:29 - 55:36)
yeah it it is the time for release if (55:32 - 55:38)
you want a game to sell the best it can (55:36 - 55:40)
right off the (55:38 - 55:43)
bat so V 100% want to state to that in (55:40 - 55:45)
my view yeah but that&#39;s why that&#39;s why (55:43 - 55:46)
it always bothered me that not bothered (55:45 - 55:48)
me but it was like weird that Legends (55:46 - 55:50)
came out in January I mean that in that (55:48 - 55:53)
sense it made s it in the context of (55:50 - 55:55)
like well they already had a November (55:53 - 55:58)
game and now this game but they don&#39;t (55:55 - 56:00)
have at least as far as we know there&#39;s (55:58 - 56:02)
no November game this (56:00 - 56:06)
year and so like the January does feel a (56:02 - 56:08)
little bit weird like I want them to (56:06 - 56:10)
take as much time as possible don&#39;t get (56:08 - 56:12)
me wrong but it&#39;s like oh you can&#39;t bump (56:10 - 56:14)
it up two months to like get your pre (56:12 - 56:16)
Christmas sales CU Christmas is (56:14 - 56:18)
important Christmas is super important I (56:16 - 56:19)
mean like I remember being 10 years old (56:18 - 56:22)
I got games twice a year for my birthday (56:19 - 56:27)
and for Christmas no other time yeah (56:22 - 56:30)
those with the (56:27 - 56:33)
days um so yeah I mean if it comes out (56:30 - 56:36)
in January that&#39;s cool uh if it comes (56:33 - 56:39)
out in April also like that&#39;s cool too (56:36 - 56:41)
take your time like I&#39;m I&#39;m not super (56:39 - 56:45)
picky uh but what do you what do you (56:41 - 56:48)
what are you expecting from this game uh (56:45 - 56:51)
do like do you I people are saying like (56:48 - 56:52)
what are the starters assuming that the (56:51 - 56:55)
starters are going to be different like (56:52 - 56:57)
possibly new Megas uh is it going to be (56:55 - 56:59)
like archus is going to be more like a (56:57 - 57:01)
city Builder which I guess archus had a (56:59 - 57:04)
little bit of archus you kind of built (57:01 - 57:08)
up the city a bit um what do you expect (57:04 - 57:08)
Joe it&#39;s really hard to say considering (57:09 - 57:14)
it&#39;s based in t in a city we are truly (57:11 - 57:17)
in new grounds new grounds in the city (57:14 - 57:21)
building thing um but I I just expect to (57:17 - 57:23)
be surprised here because Pokemon (57:21 - 57:25)
Legends as a series is clearly something (57:23 - 57:27)
different to the more tradition main (57:25 - 57:28)
Series games while still being main (57:27 - 57:31)
series yes I is main (57:28 - 57:35)
series and so I just it&#39;s really hard to (57:31 - 57:38)
say what I&#39;m expecting with this because (57:35 - 57:41)
I just it&#39;s impossible to say because (57:38 - 57:43)
you don&#39;t have these vast Open Fields (57:41 - 57:45)
with wild Pokemon you&#39;ve got these got a (57:43 - 57:48)
city and they may have like sewers like (57:45 - 57:50)
Paris has the catacombs and so you go (57:48 - 57:53)
there and you they they could have like (57:50 - 57:57)
a clan version of that but it&#39;s really (57:53 - 58:00)
hard to say what to expect from this I (57:57 - 58:02)
then guess because this is just truly (58:00 - 58:06)
new ground and that&#39;s fantastic I love (58:02 - 58:08)
new I love (58:06 - 58:11)
new I mean Legends is archus is like we (58:08 - 58:13)
just can&#39;t say Legends anymore because (58:11 - 58:14)
now there&#39;s multiple Legends games (58:13 - 58:16)
aras&#39;s deal was like completing a (58:14 - 58:21)
pokedex right yeah uh catch catch 10 (58:16 - 58:23)
Starly Now Catch 50 Starly Now Catch 200 (58:21 - 58:25)
Starly um I actually don&#39;t think that (58:23 - 58:27)
was a real thing you had to catch a lot (58:25 - 58:29)
of Starly though (58:27 - 58:34)
uh I I I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s (58:29 - 58:37)
repeatable no maybe it is probably not (58:34 - 58:39)
in a city (58:37 - 58:41)
scenario that that&#39;s but that&#39;s what (58:39 - 58:43)
makes me excited about this because (58:41 - 58:47)
obviously we don&#39;t know and the sooner (58:43 - 58:48)
we find out the better because I hate (58:47 - 58:51)
not (58:48 - 58:51)
knowing I you know with with all the (58:51 - 58:57)
speculation and specul is fun for sure (58:55 - 58:59)
with people being like Oh I think the (58:57 - 59:02)
starters are going to be like Chikorita (58:59 - 59:04)
Torchic you know Superior whatever I (59:02 - 59:07)
said two grass Pokemon uh I always (59:04 - 59:10)
thought it was weird with X and Y that (59:07 - 59:13)
the three starters never got Mega (59:10 - 59:16)
Evolution yeah and so for me it was like (59:13 - 59:18)
oh why wouldn&#39;t they just like this (59:16 - 59:20)
would be the time to give them me (59:18 - 59:22)
evolution is like your three starters (59:20 - 59:24)
are actually not from different regions (59:22 - 59:26)
they&#39;re from this region and finally (59:24 - 59:27)
they Mega maybe (59:26 - 59:30)
I&#39;m but man I still think of that to (59:27 - 59:31)
this day that wow it&#39;s kind of weird (59:30 - 59:33)
that the three starters never got Mega (59:31 - 59:35)
Evolutions but you know the Kanto ones (59:33 - 59:39)
did and then the hoen ones did MH I mean (59:35 - 59:41)
when you think about it on those lines (59:39 - 59:43)
there&#39;s only one Pokemon introduced in (59:41 - 59:45)
Gen 6 which has a mega Revolution and (59:43 - 59:49)
it&#39;s a mythical Pokemon and that&#39;s weird (59:45 - 59:51)
that is weird that is very weird it&#39;s (59:49 - 59:53)
also weird in sword and shield that (59:51 - 59:56)
there&#39;s only one Gen 5 pokemon to get J (59:53 - 59:59)
Gant X and it was garer oh yeah that was (59:56 - 60:01)
obviously hinting at black and white (59:59 - 60:04)
remakes clearly oh yeah that&#39;s true (60:01 - 60:06)
that&#39;s true that&#39;s true how how did we (60:04 - 60:09)
not see the writing on the wall there um (60:06 - 60:11)
are there Pokemon like do you think the (60:09 - 60:13)
callow starter should get megas are (60:11 - 60:15)
there Pokemon you personally want to see (60:13 - 60:16)
get (60:15 - 60:20)
megas I want to see celby get (60:16 - 60:24)
mega I mean why would why wouldn&#39;t I um (60:20 - 60:28)
it would be nice to see (60:24 - 60:31)
the cow starters get one I (60:28 - 60:34)
mean personally I&#39;ve always been a bit (60:31 - 60:37)
there with megas and I I believe (60:34 - 60:39)
gigantamax designs are superior to Mega (60:37 - 60:42)
Evolution designs I I will stand by that (60:39 - 60:45)
always because a lot of the mega designs (60:42 - 60:46)
are literally here&#39;s an Aerodactyl but I (60:45 - 60:49)
put some spikes on (60:46 - 60:49)
it a lot of Megas do like their spikes (60:50 - 60:57)
MH but with with gigant it&#39;s like it (60:53 - 60:59)
builds upon the law like gigantamax (60:57 - 61:02)
orbital is one of my favorite Pokemon (60:59 - 61:06)
mhh and so if they do new megas I want (61:02 - 61:11)
them to be more than just Pokemon with (61:06 - 61:12)
spikes (61:11 - 61:14)
understandable it&#39;s weird though because (61:12 - 61:17)
like when you think of (61:14 - 61:19)
Megas like I I personally didn&#39;t find a (61:17 - 61:22)
lot of value in Mega&#39;s like playing (61:19 - 61:24)
through the story like you could Mega (61:22 - 61:28)
against a gym leader you didn&#39;t have to (61:24 - 61:30)
uh you could Mega against the dude on (61:28 - 61:32)
Route like two and like destroy his (61:30 - 61:34)
little Caterpie with your like Mega M (61:32 - 61:36)
while um and then competitive there (61:34 - 61:39)
there would be arguments of like good (61:36 - 61:42)
Pokemon already like like meta Mega (61:39 - 61:44)
Metagross Mega salamance they were (61:42 - 61:46)
already good without their megas so they (61:44 - 61:50)
didn&#39;t really change too much of that um (61:46 - 61:52)
obviously they were a core important (61:50 - 61:54)
battle mechanic during the time but then (61:52 - 61:57)
when I think of archus there&#39;s like (61:54 - 61:59)
seven battles in that entire game and (61:57 - 62:01)
like four of them are against Volo and (61:59 - 62:04)
his Togepi before he evolves it like (62:01 - 62:07)
there&#39;s not a lot of battling so I&#39;m I&#39;m (62:04 - 62:09)
very curious because they ended with the (62:07 - 62:12)
mega symbol megas (62:09 - 62:15)
are you know at least people like the (62:12 - 62:17)
concept of Megas but like how how does (62:15 - 62:19)
that (62:17 - 62:21)
work like is this game going to be more (62:19 - 62:24)
battle focused than (62:21 - 62:26)
Legends but then how do you make that (62:24 - 62:28)
how do you make that interesting I think (62:26 - 62:30)
it will be and I think we saw hints of (62:28 - 62:31)
that in the trailer because there was (62:30 - 62:34)
the age of Slash fighting the Sylveon (62:31 - 62:36)
and it&#39;s like that that was more battles (62:34 - 62:38)
than like you said Legends arus (62:36 - 62:40)
had (62:38 - 62:43)
entirety so I like I like how megas are (62:40 - 62:45)
treated in Pokemon go like I (62:43 - 62:48)
like activating a mega to get like my (62:45 - 62:50)
bonuses for the day I kind of wish they (62:48 - 62:53)
were more unique (62:50 - 62:56)
um but it gives you a reason to at least (62:53 - 62:58)
collect them of like okay cool I don&#39;t (62:56 - 62:59)
have a dragon fairy I&#39;m going to get (62:58 - 63:01)
mega alaria I&#39;m going to power it up (62:59 - 63:05)
every day MH yeah well that was my (63:01 - 63:06)
thought too is they might be able to do (63:05 - 63:10)
something else with megas where there&#39;s (63:06 - 63:12)
something that maybe happens in a (63:10 - 63:13)
different way you know it doesn&#39;t have (63:12 - 63:16)
to be I mean I guess it&#39;s typically all (63:13 - 63:17)
battle focused when it came to like X (63:16 - 63:19)
and Y and stuff but they could do (63:17 - 63:21)
something where there&#39;s something else (63:19 - 63:23)
to it there&#39;s some other aspect of it (63:21 - 63:26)
that was never you know done before (63:23 - 63:29)
I mean it could be like the Lord Pokémon (63:26 - 63:31)
in Legends archus it could be like (63:29 - 63:33)
battles there just for battles against (63:31 - 63:35)
Mega revolutions rather than be lord (63:33 - 63:39)
Pokemon yeah right Mega Lucario can open (63:35 - 63:42)
this door you need him for this door and (63:39 - 63:44)
only this (63:42 - 63:44)
door (63:46 - 63:49)
[Music] (63:48 - 63:53)
do for for like for possibly gen 10 and (63:49 - 63:56)
the 30th Anniversary mhm like that has (63:53 - 63:58)
to be a pretty big deal right they they (63:56 - 64:00)
made a big deal about the 20th (63:58 - 64:02)
anniversary the 25th (64:00 - 64:04)
anniversary (64:02 - 64:06)
um like like do you have any (64:04 - 64:09)
expectations or anything like that you (64:06 - 64:11)
know even even if it was just the 30th (64:09 - 64:13)
Anniversary or the 35th Anniversary I (64:11 - 64:15)
feel like making it to your 10th (64:13 - 64:18)
Generation of a series in itself is a (64:15 - 64:23)
big deal yeah and considering Pokemon is (64:18 - 64:24)
the only Series where you can bring (64:23 - 64:27)
stuff back uh bring stuff forwards from (64:24 - 64:30)
games 20 odd years ago I mean granted (64:27 - 64:32)
Pokemon bank is going away at some point (64:30 - 64:35)
and they don&#39;t seem to be in a hurry to (64:32 - 64:37)
figure that situation out which is a (64:35 - 64:40)
whole other sit scenario but Pokemon&#39;s (64:37 - 64:43)
the only franchise where you can bring (64:40 - 64:45)
the stuff you took from then and bring (64:43 - 64:48)
it all the way up and so having so 30th (64:45 - 64:51)
Anniversary for is going to be a (64:48 - 64:55)
celebration and they I just want a big (64:51 - 64:57)
celebration I want to mythical Pokemon (64:55 - 65:02)
every month again oh yeah that was good (64:57 - 65:02)
myal (65:04 - 65:08)
uh I know I know we we we moved on from (65:06 - 65:10)
scarlet and violet fairly quickly to (65:08 - 65:12)
talk about Legends uh do you like what (65:10 - 65:14)
they&#39;re doing with scarlet and violet (65:12 - 65:16)
with these Mass massive mass outbreaks (65:14 - 65:18)
and these sevenstar raid events it&#39;s (65:16 - 65:21)
it&#39;s very clear that they&#39;re just going (65:18 - 65:22)
to go through every starter at this (65:21 - 65:24)
point I think we have like seven left we (65:22 - 65:27)
have like feraligator and sor (65:24 - 65:30)
tort Tera we that should at least if (65:27 - 65:32)
they&#39;re doing one a month take us to the (65:30 - 65:36)
end of the year yeah with starters um (65:32 - 65:38)
and then (65:36 - 65:38)
they oh I didn&#39;t want to interrupt you (65:40 - 65:43)
and then they they have the massive (65:42 - 65:46)
Mouse outbreaks so they they do have a (65:43 - 65:48)
lot of content do you see them doing (65:46 - 65:50)
anything more with that kind of stuff (65:48 - 65:52)
like (65:50 - 65:54)
maybe like uh like what they did with (65:52 - 65:57)
Mewtwo for around (65:54 - 66:00)
worlds uh yeah I mean it it&#39;s definitely (65:57 - 66:02)
a way to keep players engaged because (66:00 - 66:05)
people EV every month people are like oh (66:02 - 66:07)
yeah how do I do this how do I do this I (66:05 - 66:09)
mean Steve you know that better than (66:07 - 66:12)
[Laughter] (66:09 - 66:15)
anyone and so it it really gets people (66:12 - 66:18)
going it keeps people playing and it (66:15 - 66:19)
it&#39;s a different kind of event (66:18 - 66:21)
distribution because people are always (66:19 - 66:23)
like oh yeah the event distributions (66:21 - 66:25)
have gone so bad and they they haven&#39;t (66:23 - 66:27)
trust me I I have got a (66:25 - 66:30)
list and it it just basically gives (66:27 - 66:32)
another way for players to get things (66:30 - 66:33)
which they might not be able to have (66:32 - 66:36)
like before the DLC came out with these (66:33 - 66:37)
starters you needed to transfer them (66:36 - 66:39)
from Pokemon home which wasn&#39;t possible (66:37 - 66:41)
for the first six months of the game so (66:39 - 66:42)
these were Pokemon you couldn&#39;t get in (66:41 - 66:46)
the game and so doing things like this (66:42 - 66:48)
it it helps keep people playing it helps (66:46 - 66:50)
keep Pokemon in the Forefront of (66:48 - 66:52)
people&#39;s minds and that that&#39;s that&#39;s (66:50 - 66:55)
great and people say oh they still doing (66:52 - 66:59)
these should stop these it&#39;s like (66:55 - 67:02)
no no stop (66:59 - 67:05)
this yeah I I appreciate we&#39;re with the (67:02 - 67:08)
with the raids specifically that as (67:05 - 67:10)
going through these raids it&#39;s getting (67:08 - 67:13)
me to build different Pokemon get them (67:10 - 67:15)
up to level 100 and then when you look (67:13 - 67:18)
back over the last year or year and a (67:15 - 67:20)
half you can think about oh well now I (67:18 - 67:22)
have all these Pokemon at level like now (67:20 - 67:23)
I&#39;ve powered up all these Pokemon and (67:22 - 67:25)
like that&#39;s not going to go away right (67:23 - 67:28)
so I (67:25 - 67:28)
Road and they&#39;ll already and that you (67:28 - 67:34)
know it it helps build that where as you (67:31 - 67:36)
might not you know you might not need to (67:34 - 67:37)
do that if there&#39;s not all these raids (67:36 - 67:39)
coming out you just have your team you (67:37 - 67:41)
get them built up but this allows you to (67:39 - 67:46)
to Really fill out more uh more for your (67:41 - 67:46)
collection Joe when are they going to (67:46 - 67:51)
put all the Pokemon in a single Pokemon (67:48 - 67:57)
game um when the chunk fly (67:51 - 67:57)
it&#39;s not going to happen again I&#39;ve (67:59 - 68:03)
explained this to countless people right (68:00 - 68:06)
so Story Time with Joe I just knew that (68:03 - 68:08)
this question would just get you riled (68:06 - 68:09)
up that&#39;s (68:08 - 68:12)
all right so there&#39;s 10,25 Pokemon (68:09 - 68:13)
there&#39;s (68:12 - 68:15)
1,400 odd I think (68:13 - 68:18)
1,479 including forms like if you C (68:15 - 68:20)
Discount the alemy the archus let&#39;s (68:18 - 68:23)
average it how dare you discount my (68:20 - 68:26)
Aly I&#39;m just saying in terms of unique (68:23 - 68:28)
models and animations okay so that puts (68:26 - 68:32)
it at about 1300 each Pokémon has (68:28 - 68:35)
between 20 and 60 animations so that is (68:32 - 68:39)
like it can be like 100,000 animations (68:35 - 68:42)
right now with these like 1300 Pokemon (68:39 - 68:43)
every time you&#39;re adding a new feature (68:42 - 68:45)
which has five animations that&#39;s like (68:43 - 68:47)
6,000 animations you need to make and an (68:45 - 68:51)
animation can take a month just one (68:47 - 68:53)
animation if you want to put it through (68:51 - 68:55)
test it make sure it doesn&#39;t collide (68:53 - 68:57)
with everything like proper testing not (68:55 - 68:59)
like I don&#39;t want to say not like fan (68:57 - 69:03)
games testing but like like vigorous (68:59 - 69:05)
testing which you expect from a triaa (69:03 - 69:08)
title that takes time and the models are (69:05 - 69:10)
done by Pokemon CG studio and there&#39;s (69:08 - 69:14)
like 200 people working there and it you (69:10 - 69:16)
can&#39;t just throw money at this it&#39;s a (69:14 - 69:18)
Time situation you can&#39;t throw money at (69:16 - 69:20)
it you can&#39;t just suddenly expand and (69:18 - 69:21)
expect it to go well like there&#39;s a (69:20 - 69:23)
reason why too many cooks well a broth (69:21 - 69:26)
is a is anid (69:23 - 69:27)
and (69:26 - 69:31)
so as the games have shifted to 3D it (69:27 - 69:33)
has increased the workload exponentially (69:31 - 69:35)
because before it was just here&#39;s a (69:33 - 69:37)
Sprite for the front here&#39;s a Sprite for (69:35 - 69:41)
the back that&#39;s it whereas now it&#39;s (69:37 - 69:43)
months and months of work for each poke (69:41 - 69:46)
each individual Pokemon and people don&#39;t (69:43 - 69:47)
realize that it&#39;s like oh they can just (69:46 - 69:49)
Port the models over it&#39;s like no they (69:47 - 69:51)
can&#39;t that&#39;s not how the engines work (69:49 - 69:52)
learn game development stop listening to (69:51 - 69:57)
random YouTubers sorry Steve (69:52 - 69:59)
I don&#39;t say (69:57 - 69:59)
that I I um yeah you know an interest I (70:00 - 70:08)
think I saw you tweet this and I didn&#39;t (70:05 - 70:09)
think about it but like when when you (70:08 - 70:11)
think about like what game had all the (70:09 - 70:13)
Pokemon it was Ultra Sun Ultra moon like (70:11 - 70:15)
it had ultimately all the Pokemon right (70:13 - 70:19)
but when you think about (70:15 - 70:22)
how technically scarlet and violet has (70:19 - 70:26)
more Pokemon than Ultra Sun Ultra (70:22 - 70:29)
Moon it just doesn&#39;t have all of them (70:26 - 70:31)
and like I didn&#39;t really think about (70:29 - 70:32)
that cuz you&#39;re like ah the game comes (70:31 - 70:34)
with 400 Pokemon okay they added like (70:32 - 70:36)
hundred and whatever and then they added (70:34 - 70:38)
another 100 whatever and then you know (70:36 - 70:39)
you have to like sit there and do the (70:38 - 70:43)
math but it it is it is such a a like (70:39 - 70:45)
they&#39;re not going to stop adding Pokemon (70:43 - 70:47)
we&#39;re going to get more than a, more (70:45 - 70:49)
than 1200 more than 1300 and at a (70:47 - 70:51)
certain point you kind of have to like (70:49 - 70:53)
like how do you how do you remedy that (70:51 - 70:56)
issue without just making cuts exactly (70:53 - 70:58)
it&#39;s like Scarlet Violet with the DLC (70:56 - 71:00)
well Scarlet Violet in general even (70:58 - 71:01)
without the DLC has the highest amount (71:00 - 71:05)
of Pokémon available in it as encoded (71:01 - 71:08)
in well when I say sorry when I say (71:05 - 71:11)
available in it I mean available in it (71:08 - 71:14)
because you have 690 native Pokemon with (71:11 - 71:17)
733 coded in the highest before that was (71:14 - 71:19)
sword and shield with (71:17 - 71:23)
653 available and 662 coded in and like (71:19 - 71:25)
that&#39;s more than Ultra Sun Ultra Moon (71:23 - 71:28)
had ultr Moon had 561 um I don&#39;t have (71:25 - 71:30)
this memorized I do literally have a (71:28 - 71:33)
chart on my screen here I&#39;m not that (71:30 - 71:34)
crazy (71:33 - 71:37)
well hey I&#39;ve seen you recite the whole (71:34 - 71:39)
Pokedex from start to finish it was very (71:37 - 71:43)
impressive thank (71:39 - 71:43)
you but it it&#39;s just it&#39;s a development (71:43 - 71:50)
thing and when the dexit was announced I (71:47 - 71:53)
was trying to find out what happened (71:50 - 71:56)
because I I was outraged and then I (71:53 - 71:58)
decided to investigate you know I (71:56 - 72:01)
decided to do my job and I spoke to (71:58 - 72:04)
people throughout the industry and every (72:01 - 72:06)
time I spoke to a person in game (72:04 - 72:09)
development about it their response was (72:06 - 72:11)
I&#39;m surprised this didn&#39;t happen sooner (72:09 - 72:14)
because it&#39;s (72:11 - 72:14)
unsustainable yeah it&#39;s a lot um and (72:16 - 72:22)
people want animations to get better and (72:19 - 72:23)
they want the game to look better and (72:22 - 72:26)
they want (72:23 - 72:28)
they want advancements but it&#39;s it&#39;s (72:26 - 72:31)
like hard to balance yeah a thousand (72:28 - 72:35)
plus different creatures yeah (72:31 - 72:35)
exactly is is to not to keep you here (72:36 - 72:43)
all night is there something in uh in (72:39 - 72:44)
any Pokemon game that you feel is (72:43 - 72:46)
missing or that you&#39;ve seen in another (72:44 - 72:48)
game that you would like Pokemon to go (72:46 - 72:50)
down and I know that&#39;s kind of a hard (72:48 - 72:52)
question because I think like before (72:50 - 72:54)
sword and shield came out I would have (72:52 - 72:57)
never thought about like Co-op raid (72:54 - 72:59)
battles and for me I feel like raids are (72:57 - 73:01)
something that kind of needs to stick (72:59 - 73:03)
around like trading or breeding or just (73:01 - 73:06)
100% um and I absolutely love it it like (73:03 - 73:08)
I make you I literally make YouTube (73:06 - 73:10)
videos on how people can do raids easier (73:08 - 73:12)
like but like I genuinely love that kind (73:10 - 73:14)
of content it&#39;s just the kind of player (73:12 - 73:16)
I am I like playing with other people is (73:14 - 73:17)
there is there something you feel like (73:16 - 73:18)
games are missing or something you&#39;d (73:17 - 73:19)
like to (73:18 - 73:22)
see um well if they&#39;re sticking with the (73:19 - 73:26)
open world then I want them and sticking (73:22 - 73:28)
with it being open Airway you can do (73:26 - 73:30)
things in any order I do want them to (73:28 - 73:33)
scale it right so even if it&#39;s not like (73:30 - 73:37)
a scale like a mathematical scale where (73:33 - 73:38)
instead it&#39;s like if you&#39;ve got one (73:37 - 73:40)
badge that all the gym leaders are this (73:38 - 73:42)
if you got two badges all the gym (73:40 - 73:44)
leaders of that I think that&#39;s something (73:42 - 73:45)
which scarlet and Viet was missing (73:44 - 73:49)
because I ended up um doing (73:45 - 73:52)
gruia like fifth struggling with it at (73:49 - 73:54)
first whil I was in the coverage and (73:52 - 73:56)
that I didn&#39;t realize it was the eth gym (73:54 - 73:58)
leader yeah because I I was just (73:56 - 74:00)
following what the Pokemon Senter lady (73:58 - 74:03)
was telling me to go mhm and oh cuz she (74:00 - 74:05)
tells you like mostly nearby right yeah (74:03 - 74:09)
MH and so things like that are (74:05 - 74:11)
definitely if they&#39;re going to continue (74:09 - 74:13)
damage part that things like that of (74:11 - 74:15)
what the games need in my view and (74:13 - 74:17)
that&#39;s like one of the big fundamental (74:15 - 74:19)
issues I have with scarlet and violet (74:17 - 74:20)
that and you can&#39;t enter buildings (74:19 - 74:23)
anymore but yeah (74:20 - 74:25)
was big one I thought that was a little (74:23 - 74:27)
weird that was weird for (74:25 - 74:31)
sure but other than that just with the (74:27 - 74:34)
social play because the blue bre Quest (74:31 - 74:37)
that was a another social play thing but (74:34 - 74:38)
they might have gone a bit too far with (74:37 - 74:42)
how grindy it is without other players (74:38 - 74:46)
yeah so but the social play has always (74:42 - 74:49)
been a key aspect of Pokemon since (74:46 - 74:51)
Pokemon red and green that&#39;s why Pokemon (74:49 - 74:53)
took off let&#39;s face it that is why (74:51 - 74:57)
Pokemon took off and so continuing the (74:53 - 74:59)
social Play Elements that&#39;s definitely (74:57 - 75:02)
for play and like having people in your (74:59 - 75:06)
open world at the same time it was like (75:02 - 75:07)
got teased with the wild area where you (75:06 - 75:09)
saw everyone go around you can interact (75:07 - 75:10)
with them but then scarlet and violet (75:09 - 75:13)
perfected that it&#39;s like I don&#39;t want it (75:10 - 75:16)
to be a case where you just have like a (75:13 - 75:19)
hundred people across Pala it&#39;s like (75:16 - 75:21)
that would be horrendous but if they (75:19 - 75:24)
continue on that path that would be a (75:21 - 75:27)
good thing so I just really can&#39;t think (75:24 - 75:31)
of anything that missing other than just (75:27 - 75:33)
like scaling and (75:31 - 75:36)
fine-tuning I will say one thing that&#39;s (75:33 - 75:38)
that I I loved in legends that I do wish (75:36 - 75:42)
had can carried over was being able to (75:38 - 75:45)
catch a Pokemon without battling yeah (75:42 - 75:47)
just being able to launch a Pokeball at (75:45 - 75:49)
it and catch it that way was and I get (75:47 - 75:52)
that because of the way that Legends was (75:49 - 75:55)
that made more sense but that was (75:52 - 75:56)
something I did really love about it (75:55 - 75:58)
where you know you had that option and I (75:56 - 76:00)
always love like more options right more (75:58 - 76:03)
more ability to do different things and (76:00 - 76:04)
I thought that was really cool that was (76:03 - 76:05)
a little bumed that didn&#39;t carry on to (76:04 - 76:07)
Scarlet (76:05 - 76:11)
violet yeah yeah I would I would like (76:07 - 76:16)
more things to check that seems weird (76:11 - 76:16)
but (76:16 - 76:20)
like specifically with like the breeding (76:16 - 76:23)
aspect I really liked in Pokey pelo the (76:20 - 76:25)
the spa I really liked that before I (76:23 - 76:29)
wrapped up my day I could put 18 eggs in (76:25 - 76:31)
the spa and then I&#39;m excited to come (76:29 - 76:33)
back to the game the next morning so I (76:31 - 76:35)
guess I guess when I think when I think (76:33 - 76:37)
of like more things to check but like (76:35 - 76:40)
doing something in the game that then (76:37 - 76:42)
you&#39;re excited to come back to the next (76:40 - 76:44)
day and I there are games that already (76:42 - 76:46)
do this like animal crossing right like (76:44 - 76:48)
yeah oh boy I can&#39;t wait till tomorrow (76:46 - 76:49)
because I&#39;m going to continue working on (76:48 - 76:51)
this project um and I do kind of wish (76:49 - 76:53)
that Pokemon had more of that because (76:51 - 76:55)
otherwise it&#39;s like (76:53 - 76:57)
you&#39;re kind of waiting for Pokemon to do (76:55 - 76:58)
something like there&#39;s a raid event this (76:57 - 77:00)
weekend okay now I gotta go catch this (76:58 - 77:01)
or maybe I&#39;ll shiny hunt this and then (77:00 - 77:05)
I&#39;ll raise it up to a 100 um it would be (77:01 - 77:06)
nice if there was gosh I don&#39;t even know (77:05 - 77:08)
what the word for that it almost feels (77:06 - 77:10)
like a mobile game of like forcing you (77:08 - 77:11)
to come back but it&#39;s it&#39;s not like (77:10 - 77:13)
forcing you to come back it&#39;s just like (77:11 - 77:15)
you&#39;re doing something that will make (77:13 - 77:19)
you excited to come back yeah I get (77:15 - 77:22)
that bring back my spa I want put eggs (77:19 - 77:26)
in poke pelo should be in every game (77:22 - 77:27)
or just make it its own thing make it (77:26 - 77:29)
its own mobile game or something I don&#39;t (77:27 - 77:32)
know but I love poke (77:29 - 77:35)
