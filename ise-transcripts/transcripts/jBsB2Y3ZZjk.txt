[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 413 episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SBJ with me today will ya hi I love Pokemon and yesterday I went mountain biking for the first time and now I have a bruise on my heinie that is in the shape of the state of Texas did you get a new car a new cart heck no oh that wasn't your car than that the bike was on correct got it never a mountain bike alone in case something grievous happens you need somebody to take you to the hospital that makes sense Greg that was not your car I'm assuming heck no I got out on the trails you won't get me on the trails heck yeah what mountain did you go to there are no mountain yeah the land of a million rivers there's that but mountain biking is kind of a very vague and unspecific term that actually you went off-roading on your bike you went off pathing it's it is a mountain bike trail and actually I realize I said it's a vague and unspecific term that captures a number of sports including jumping off tall cliffs and landing which I did not do where did you go though uh lakeville okay Greg how are you I'm you know hey it's 63 today I sat outside of the restaurant 16 feet away from everybody else and I had brunch sounds lovely normal life yeah it was nice this restaurant did provide civil where unlike last weekend where they wouldn't unless you asked for silverware intriguing mmm well we got a jam-packed show this is the last episode before the aisle of armour I think I said it right not the armor of Isle armor island is harmony island yeah welcome to armor island so last show normally we have like a game show last show forever normally we have a game plan normally when like new Pokemon stuff comes out I usually give Greg and well time off so they can enjoy the games without stressing and then I do like this miniseries but I add like five minutes of content how much time do we need yeah I'm not I said at least seven hours of content thank you that's a Saturday expect a normal episode next Monday whatever that number is 414 and if there is a lot of content and we might need to break it up then we might do a bonus episode on like Friday or Saturday for you guys but I'm not sure this is the first time they've ever done DLC so it's weird I expect I expect the story to be amazing two to three hours and then I expect the wild area to be a couple hours of you know continuing to catch things we all know you are spending 17 hours playing with a robot that is all you're going to do you're devoting an entire stream to cram a bot cram o matic crab memetic bot and we don't even know when this comes out it's on the 17th question mark yeah I mean it's within a 23 hour 59 minute time range don't be so extreme that it's like a mystery that you have to have a crystal ball yeah well let's let's let's start off with that Pokemon news because we don't actually know when this game releases besides the 17th and we're recording this on the 14th and there is no actual timeframe here what we do know and this is our first bit of news is Pokemon home will have maintenance on the 17th so that plant of that could be something or it could be unrelated he knows something could be something so this is in the Pokemon home app it says thank you for the continued support of Pokemon home.look Game Freak you already got money so like I can back out of this agreement oh you know what I what because I haven't played my Pokemon bank since my Pokemon home transfer you had to buy Bank again they had to buy Bank again see this is how they get nickel and diming you yeah I I had to ask for the silverware once I purchased it yeah I went in and I was like oh no there's no Pokemon here they deleted them and then I was like wait a minute I moved them all but I knew it was my account because it remembered all the names of the boxes so I was like oh yeah everything is still here so anyways because you had to transfer stuff from the 3ds I had to yes so I'm on a mission to get all 890 Pokemon before the DLC which if you're listening to this on Monday I will be trying to get the last 60 Pokemon on twitch.tv slash pkmn cast ten hour stream on Monday fearless if you're in the future you missed it but I have 60 more Pokemon to go what does get them mean he means catch them himself and not get them trained and he he claims he is hunting them when in reality he is randomly going to places and stumbling upon Pokemon and going oh I need that one and then claiming it's the thrill of the hunt when really he is stumbling around fine but you understand when you find something how do you not have them already okay okay so I have I have like eight living Dex's I have one in Pokemon go that is useless to me right now because I cannot merge that with Pokemon that's okay given that point taken I have seed i living decks in in LAC - white - the first games that introduced the shiny term but I cannot move those Pokemon out of there yet because I'm I'm missing like 40 Pokemon in that that I have - you don't have a little bit almost lemming decks and then I have no no I have like I have a bunch of the starter poker in my current living decks in home I'm missing like the middle evolutions the forgettable ones you know the kracken oz the koalas the the most important ones yes but Grovyle howl of how do you claim living decks without having all the Pokemon I have those I have those I have those middle ones the Forgotten ones in black - white - like I can't move them up to into sword and shield because they need to stay in black to light - for now see I have a grand plan here right I have all so I like here so in my Lindex in home I'm missing a zoo zoo Merle and I have one in in x and y but it's shiny so I can't move that into the home Dex because it doesn't have enough ribbons on it to be worthy enough to get moved into home so it has to live in my for now my word I have to find another azumarill this is the problem with the season this is your problem here is this is your madness of King Steve problem right there like I know where they are I can go horde hunt them in X&Y just go go back and get another one it's all good it's part of it's part of the thrill of the hunt we will be hunting ok so I've made the poor decision of moving my Reshiram and my zechariah zechariah and rescher LOM I made the poor decision I caught them in ultra Sun ultramoon and then I moved them up without thinking I need both of these in my parties to get the Kuro ROM Hyrum so now I don't have kirim because I and I can't III would either two options here cuz thrill of the hunt somebody could just trade me a kirim but that's that's no fun I need my own kiram and I do have a cure man black - my - but that caroms not allowed to come up yet what so I have two options I either go to one of my other ultra games and I find my restaurant Russia Ram zekrom in those games and then move them over to my main ultra Sun altra and then go hunt kirim or I think this is fair I borrow a restaurant and a Zekrom from somebody to put in my party and then I can start the thrill of the hunt to find the kirim and then when I'm done getting the cure of my return said Zekrom and rush Ram to their owner yeah who's gonna be foolish enough to lend you that hey I have Pokemon for collateral such as you know I can I can let that person hold on to you know meloetta or a Zahra hora if they don't believe I'm gonna why would I steal now you're just gonna accidentally delete it yeah you're like I don't need this anymore release release and then all weekend I've heard people say well you know azumarill is in the expansion but the goal is to get these Pokemon before the expansions because I'm going to catch all 100 Pokemon again in the expansion because I genuinely like catching pokémon that brings us back to our home article so it says this notice is to inform you that maintenance for Pokemon home is scheduled for the following date and time during this maintenance all functions of home will be unavailable will take place on Wednesday June 17th 9 UTC to 14 UTC planned and it will affect both in attendance which version and the mobile version of home after maintenance users will need to update the switch version to one point one point zero and the mobile version to one point two point zero the mobile version right now I believe is one point one and the switch version is one point zero point one yes right so UTC time a little confusing I believe for Central Time which the three of us are in that is between 4 a.m. Central Time - 9 a.m. Central Time so it's 5 hours of maintenance on the 17th so I think Sarah be Joe from Serie B also said that it doesn't seem likely and I do I do agree with Joe on this but I would love to hear it as his thoughts it doesn't seem likely that they would release DLC and then bring down home for 5 hours but after they release DLC it would be more logical to be like maintenance is done and here's DLC for everyone because you have to update these Pokemon products that we've taken down for 5 hours yeah no that'll is that they'll watch the DLC once the maintenance is complete yes on home yeah because you can because the whole point of the DLC is that you now have access to all these other pokemons yes but also I could easily see them saying we're taking it down so you can't just dump all the Pokemon in and get whatever reward might be hiding in the DLC for filling out that part of the Dex so they may also be taking it that releasing it taking it down so you can't transfer for five hours again they're like we're gonna throttle you for five hours I don't know look companies throttle for worse reasons for weirder ties yeah I mean I don't think that I just don't think they that is necessarily indicator one way or the other I don't either it just if we know that sword and shield will probably have to receive an update because that's how expansions work right you have the update your product match yeah oh well actually when I bought it just like last week it downloaded a bunch of content yeah right away man I hope this update comes with fixes though I mean that tree texture finally can be all of you I am and the next person who complains about the tree texture I'm coming to your house with an Atari 2600 and of course you can sit in front of it for eight hours this duck was a dragon but if okay so if the deals he come came out first I mean this whole conversations could be useless in 72 hours but if the DLC came out first it would give people the ability to start transferring and then they bring it down yes unless the DLC comes out in the middle of the downtime or oh that when the downtime starts mmm yeah see there's many paths that this could take I mean I think I don't think they're honestly caring if they match up I mean they plan to be I means then they know but I mean so if if home requires an update when it comes back up and requires an additional download on both they may not wish to have multiple of the same server trying to do two things at once dependent has already like when we saw home come out people were bogged and couldn't download home for hours at a time because everybody was accessing it so they may take down home and say okay everybody download the DLC so the surface are only working on that and then once that is done you get a five hour window will update home and then you have to download that update we don't even know how we're gonna play through it like as our suddenly stopped working are we bringing all our pokemon over are we gonna breeze through this DLC in ten minutes because all our Pokemon are level 100 I think what this really says is there's only gonna be five hours of content in the DLC what if they gate it so that you can only bring like do certain things with Pokemon that are under a certain level hmm I can only tell you that there will definitely be home maintenance on the 17th and there will definitely be a Pokemon game releasing at some point in time during that day I mean if it releases at midnight for everyone like games normally release like again this is an expansion though but I don't even I I guess I could do it right it's their game they could release by region / DLC but I don't I can't think of any DLC that has ever been released by region like Final Fantasy the DLC is for everyone at the same time destiny does ease for everyone monster 100 DLCs the same time for everyone I also don't understand why they're doing it on a Wednesday well they the Pokemon company has been consistently inconsistent about everything no grey version no Petrino - off the patterns exactly no new V's and gen 8 no Friday release they're really good at throwing a wrench in things June 12th this is going on right now gallery' and Meowth is your mystery gift you just to connect to the internet connect a mystery gift you get glaring mouths of the hidden ability unnerve that isn't a cherished ball plus a hundred plus a hundred experience candies large plus fifty nuggets and that does not have an end date like the last three did if you're listening to this podcast now you missed mr. mime ponyta and glaring corsola and all the items that came with that but fear not meowth is available for you to get for the foreseeable future Pokemon journey the series now available on Netflix you can watch the first 12 episodes of the 23rd season you can follow Ashe determined to be a Pokemon master and go aiming to catch one of every Pokemon including the mythical Mew first 12 episodes are on Netflix us Netflix I should say that for our Canadian people I think in Canada it's on telly tuned I have not watched it yet as of this recording I'm excited though I have not started watching it either me either we should have a party where everybody's together we all watch it together Netflix watch party yes I guess so defeated I just want to get together like at - well we could use that room and just put up a whole bunch of barriers there's a 10-person limit to that room oh there were some people questioning if this is a reboot it is not it is technically season 23 a continuation of season 22 a small spoiler I believe in the second episode of the series when you're in ashes room you do see all his championships from the you know runner-ups from Hoenn and sin out to the first place for the ole ola region those all those trophies are in his room even though the season I believe starts off with a flashback - Pikachu being a Pichu just to clear up some confusion on that Gregg you want to talk about some Pokemon masters um do I like what do you wanted me to talk about ah there's a new legendary event disclaimer disclaimer disclaimer I am partnered with DNA gray Greg and will are not we are not there for you to say what they want well I'm not like I was gonna say I really like when you take like some bacon and put it between the pancakes and then you kind of eat it as a bacon pancake sandwich bacon pancakes makin bacon pancakes Entei and signa suit Grimsley and Sharpedo come to Pokemon masters get ready trainers June is bringing all sorts of exciting updates events and new features to masters you will now find a legendary event featuring the mighty Entei and the opportunity to earn medals the sync pair wearing Cygnus suits includes the debut of Cygnus suit Grimsley and Sharpedo and the return of Cygnus Cygnus suit Eliza and Rotom + new story chapters the legendary event will be available from June 10th to June 24th the event takes form of a hard raid type battle which you can only deploy a certain number of sync pairs to defeat Entei while you won't be able to catch Entei after beating it you'll be able to show off your defeat with a brand new metal medals are tied to in game that you can assign to your characters you can see what other players that other players can see if you defeat Entei you will earn a medal to prove that accomplishment additionally from June 10th to June 29th you can sync you can scout the 5 star water-type Cygnus suit Grimsley and Sharpedo making their masters debut and the return of Elsa and Rotom and they have expanded chapters 24 and 25 have you done the Entei I have not it's it's cool I didn't realize that when you pokemon die they die or uh you can't you've got of what they're removed from your sink yeah they're actually removed from their game yeah the game yeah one for a wrecked it is very similar so if if you haven't played masters or your haven't done this event yet I would I would probably compare it to like a raid boss in in sword and shield where Entei has pretty much three life meters but there there's like the first two are like shields that you have to take down and then once you take it down you have its final life meter and then you can once you defeat it you defeat it but if if you start with your best sync pairs like I did I started with my three water sync pairs that I I powered up and used for the whole event I was able to take down the first shield pretty easily and then half way the second shield and then when in teh defeats you you can go back in but you're not allowed to use those three sync pairs at all anymore they're done so you I went in with a lesser team and I was able to take down the second shield which let me see antes final health bar and then I realized that the rest of my teams are not as good as my water based team and Entei was very easy to clean those up and I was able to get into it down to about 25% but there's a little reset button so you can reset em tase health get all your sync pairs back and you can then re strategize and try it again like I could because I wasn't fully aware of what I was doing I could probably invest a little bit on my first water sync pairs and then going again and have like a stronger first showing so cleanup is easier so it's kind of like a puzzle in a way or maybe you don't want to go with your best think pair maybe you want to go with you know a slightly different sync pair to stop Entei from getting all their power-ups but it's not like pay to win I mean like like the press release says it's not like you can get Entei you just get a little metal showing that you've completed the event but if you like to flex which is 99 percent of Pokemon games at this point and I don't like getting a medal is like okay whatever yeah speaking of powering up sync pairs this was the news of Pokemon masters is our last bit of masters news it's a pretty long message from the Masters team this is volume 11 if you guys remember volume 10 that's when they talked about adding the stannum a system you say we appreciate the feedback regarding sync pairs we plan to improve them we are currently developing a new way to strengthen sync pairs we plan to release these around the first anniversary of the game which is coming up I think what was that September I don't remember we played at Worlds in August I think it was September I think it was September September sounds about right one of the fans most frequent request is to see more new sync pairs as well as existing sync pairs and signa suits and seasonal outfits I think we've only gotten to seasonal outfits and that was for Christmas I think yes many sync pairs haven't debuted or on on their way this doesn't say in the press release but I personally am still waiting for gen8 sync pairs we are working to ensure that sync pairs in Sigma suits and seasonal outfits will appear more frequently than before they talked about AG events events based on egg Pokemon are coming in July I was gonna say are they doing more of those egg distributions they really went so well each Pokemon you can get from these events will be different and each one will have each one's rolls will have a number of passive skills that will be random there will also be a very rare chance that shiny pokemon will hatch it will encourage trainers to try to find their favorites in addition first time they've had Chinese and masters it is their you know in addition to developing these features we are also working expanding the content and preparing for new events there are new legendary events coming and then in May's survey we collected feedback about the three planned improvements which is reduced this time spent battling for items which is one of Greg's complaints yep easier identification of battles that reward items I feel like I know what battles are giving me which items but okay once you know the system yeah but like clicking there's so many clicks to if you don't know like in especially in the training area like I don't know what this means and oh sure Sheila gives me what there's so many clicks to get in there yeah this yeah they definitely need to clean that there's a lot of different sodas too if you're a new time player and a change to the number of battles per day the survey response indicated that many players wanted to obtain more items efficiently even if the number of battles is limited that's what the survey said Gregg I wanna know who they surveyed I wanna have a sidebar with some of these people it's the same people from family feud and then you just look at the answers and you're like you're like why what how base of the feedback will launch a new stamina system based on on a trial base to solicit additional player input to help us create the best possible experience with the current system you can obtain a set number of items based on the time you spent playing and any time you are not actively repeating a battle you are missing an opportunity of playing more of obtaining more items that's a pretty true statement I would say yes that is a very true statement with the stand of most system you'll receive a much higher number of rewards in a shorter time and the time you save will go towards recharging your stamina stamina sorry I mean that mechanic isn't new it's been in most mobile games since the dawn of time here ultimately we hope to reduce the time spent repeating the same battles and provide a more balanced gameplay experience for everyone to give you an idea of what to expect here's a detailed explanation of the new system where stamp stamina is explicable so this is where your limited main story single player only level up area cap unlock area sink orb area evolution material area and some events new limits are not opposed on legendary arena which is the Entei event I explained the battle Villa and co-op battles in general which would be battle villa main story x challenge or certain event battles you can continue to play those as much as you want because the new system will impact game balance we're launching it on a trial basis meaning we'll be listening to your feedback and making improvements along the way or even reverting back to the current system if needed regardless we are working to ensure the final result is enjoyable then they go on to say the current training area will be renamed e.x Plaza and battles found in courses and super courses will be redesigned as a new part of a training area to simplify the process of collecting items we are making it so you can tell which items are easily obtainable so you'll have the level up area the cap unlock area the sync orb area and the evolution material area there will be a maximum of 10 attempts available each day in the sink orb area and up to 90 items will be obtainable with each attempt making it a possible to acquire 900 co-op sync orbs each days is that a lot Greg I mean it will get you a lot of the very first level unlocks a lot of ice so like I'm look like like looking at it right now so if I want to unlock Cygnus utilizes one move it I have to spend I think 24 of the coop sync orbs and then it only increases and that's like the first ring out of the basics so it really ramps up quickly like the big move like further down that you want to go towards like a hundred and twenty depending on how many you're trying to do I think it's a fair amount I don't think it's particularly stingy but like it's not giving away the farm either I mean it's it's it's sort of hard to tell like I there's so many that aren't don't have full sync grids yet so right now it's probably great but in the future it could be like this isn't enough but if you start now and they're just building up and you'll have a lot I'm assuming too unlike the ones once everybody's fully unlocked our next message is scheduled for late July we'll go over future updates and anniversary celebrations in more detail we work hard to make improvements we prioritize your feedback until next time Pokemon master Sasaki and operations producer Gucci yeah it's I mean the problem with the stamina system is they're saying it it will reward you know it helps the you you aren't feeling like you're missing out on rewards because it's gonna stop you the big question is how good are those rewards like my hope is that they have looked at how much people would get in a day and have at least come close to matching that with their stamina system because otherwise it will feel like you've artificially put brakes on something that a very small amount of people were doing and those people are the ones that are giving you the most money and you have limited them for no reason and for the rest of us it feels worse if if the feedback it was truly we don't mind stamina for better rewards if that was the general consensus and I don't want to like label people of like oh the the people who don't play eight hours straight who the people who don't play masters eight hours straight straight are clearly not hardcore enough I just think of a like a situation of how I play which is I wake up in the morning I do I get my daily login bonus --is I do like two or three matches maybe maybe a little bit more if there's like an event going on like the whole event obviously I played a lot more and then I don't really think about masters until before I go to bed where I go well I can't fall asleep let's just do let's check Pokemon go alright no good spawns in my house like always all right let's do masters all right let's do three matches and then I go to bed so in my situation and I know this is obviously not everyone's I feel like it doesn't affect me the only thing I'm getting is more rewards for the you know three matches in the morning unless for some reason I can't do like three matches in the morning and it's limited to like two yeah but we don't know like how many matches you're allowed in a day except they said co-op you're allowed ten but also I just it's hard to put myself in the shoes of somebody who's like today is my day to play masters I'm gonna play it from four hours straight because if I have four hours to play a video game it's probably not even mobile yeah that's been my current problem the appeal to mobile games for me is like I'm gonna play it while I'm waiting for the bus or while I'm waiting for you know a table at last time you took a bus [Laughter] match of masters as well puts air in his tire for his bike excitement hasn't done that and my buddy owns a compressor so that takes seconds but here's the deal the problem is you don't let me be polite breathe William you don't have a traditional job those of us with traditional jobs sit in our long meetings where we literally don't have to pay attention or provide any input yeah therefore mobile games come to the rescue yes they do that is where Pokemon masters excels yeah I am hoping that the system like if you get ten per day that that's front-loaded and not you will earn ten over the course of a day so that people who play like you do where you wake up in the morning you're like I've got time so I'm gonna run through my stuff and then we'll have some for the evening instead of I get one in the morning because they come in at a slow rate and they don't stack so I have to plot this out I'm really hoping that it's much more front-loaded like here's here's everything in the morning and you can blow through all them and then you don't have to think about the game for the rest of the day I mean right now it's we have to have the game open 24/7 and we have to keep hitting repeat mission because that's the only way to grind materials and that's not great either like that's not the best the way you could be interacting with the game okay we got a little bit of Pokemon going news we got some more sword and shield news and we got some more donation stuff but we're gonna take a quick break we'll come back we'll talk about all of that so we'll be right back I love so much this was sent in over by Chris this is off Pokemon calm this is for you will which Chris clarify I can I can get you the details here Chris G okay okay yes trustworthy source no no not in the slightest bit but he is a medical professional so I mean

pokegear 3.0 pokemon communication and reset stamp with new art I don't think reset stamp is terribly expensive I think that's maybe a dollar or two but it's a very popular card you will get more than a hundred energies all of the energy including special energy you will get four booster packs hey that's pretty cool I didn't know that so that's uh or eight twelve sixteen sixteen bucks right there you will get sixty five card sleeves to protect your deck a deck building guide a complete rulebook a set of seven tournament legal dice to condition markers and a code for the TCG on line and it will be available june 26 where TCG products are sold what is the manufacturer's suggested retail price it doesn't say what they don't suggest hey what do you think 50 $49.99 I'd imagine it's gonna be somewhere between 50 and 80 yeah he D let's see if somebody else has it cool stuff Inc said they have it out of stock no price well of course because it that you can't put a price on hmm what I mean out of style because it's not available yet so according to this one website cards in all gaming which I don't know this is trustworthy that's about as dubious as most of the places they have one in stock for $29.99 oh that is way under price I am at trolling toad and they say they have no in stock but it was 20 99 Wow oh hey you know that is a good deal that it's a good deal yeah cuz for booster packs and the den A's I mean the Denny's alone get heed to dinner yeah make it seem pretty worth it well until they rotate them out in like a week or ban them no dude na I lied about the den a by the way it's not a $15.00 card it looks like it is closer to a 25 dollar card where is dot-com has it for 39.99 well yeah because every place else ran out so now they can jack up the price but there's pre-order everything's pre-order it doesn't come out until June 26 yes but how does one company have it for $10 more maybe the well sometimes trolling tote and cool stuff Inc will take a hit in the price Hugh stack on the free shipping right cuz it's like oh you know it's $12 to ship this $30 product but if I spend 40 more dollars so this one page that I'm looking on cool stuffing says it's 30 4.99 I'll tell you one thing that I come across in my TCG purchasing quite often is that Oh some places will say they'll have a pre-order stock let's put an imaginary number on it of 20 right and for that original set there they're like all right we'll do close to MSRP will do the $30 and then they judge on how fast that sells out to see Oh is there a real demand for this product or not and if there's if it sells out fast and there's real demand then they'll come out with like a second pre-order set and raise that price like by $10 and then if that super fast sells out they'll raise it another $10 and they'll say this is such a high demand thing so like every subsequent offer to pre-order they just like keep raising the price sounds like a Kickstarter the world of trading card game economics should be a college course because it's disturbing and it's morally bankrupt can I tell you a new TCG issue yes okay so do you guys know I'm in Wills very familiar with this you you go to you know target you go have the TCG I'll you see that they release a box and then in that box is like four booster packs one probably crimson invasion but it has one of those jumbo cards yeah and these jumbo card oh is this your book thing yeah so these jumbo cards have existed since X&Y I think they started doing it I think X&Y I don't remember but anyways they're like useless you get the Jumbo cards I don't know who they're actually for you can see the back of the TCG car very pixelated because it wasn't like originally designed at that high-res of a texture you can't do anything with them I guess maybe like five year old kids or six year olds like love them cuz they're like big versions of their card or whatever but most of the time I just threw them away I already got enough Pokemon junk out in order to put these cards when I ordered the the Pikachu zekrom Charizard rush Ram battle boxes that they released recently which you can see a pattern here in the teeth the seems that the Pokemon company is really trying to get people into TCG with these battle boxes with this new trainer box coming out and the board game and the board game they're like trying really hard they're pushing hard hard hard and they also paid a couple youtubers to like teach people how to install and get into PTC geo online there's a bunch of I mean it's very obvious if you see a youtuber all of a sudden like learn how to play PTC Gio hashtag Edie so that they're they're really pushing this year but that's not the point the point is when I pre-ordered these two boxes the the rush or Ram Charizard and the Pikachu because they have Jirachi 's and they have code cards and they're really good for people who are missing these rare rare or expensive cards it came with a little book like a pre-order like you spent $50 here's a jumbo binder for your jumbo cards is the first time they've done it they've been releasing these jumbo cards since X&Y you know all through Sun and Moon they've had these jumbo cards the Pokemon company officially released a binder for these jumbo cards and I was like great I bought the tax tricity box I bought the polti guys box I bought the GMAX Meowth box and I didn't throw those cards away yet and so I put him in the binder and I was like you know what I think I'm gonna collect jumbo cards now now you have them for your children right I have a place to put them they fit the twist is at some point and the point was when they switched a sword and shield they slightly changed the size of these jumbo cards so everything X&Y and Sun and Moon and detective Pikachu they're like a quarter of an inch too wide and too long so they don't fit into the binder how dare the biggest scam in Pokemon absolutely absent you got scammed so yeah all those cards still worthless but I guess if you're collecting the sword and shield cards you're they'll fit in the binder I don't know where you get this binder by itself by the way I got as a pre-order bonus but I don't you don't you don't you either collect them or you don't that's all the TCG stuff we have speaking of money the Pokemon company announces off espn.com surprisingly enough Pokemon company announces five million dollar donations to nonprofit organizations the Pokemon company has announced they will donate a minimum of five million dollars to nonprofit organizations around the world this official statement was on the Pokemon Twitter it said donations will go go towards improving the lives of children with a focus on diversity equality and inclusion in our ongoing commitment to the black community this will include organizations supporting education and mentorship opportunities for black children and quote they then followed up with a tweet saying they will provide a list of charities at a later date this matches the five million dollar pledge that knee antic makers of Pokemon Go announced the donations will be made following the Pokemon go fest taking place virtually on July 25th 26 quote we are so incredibly grateful to our partners at the Pokemon company who are also donating a million a minimum of five million dollars to nonprofit organizations following Pokemon go Fest 2020 we aim to be a force of change nee antic tweeted in response to the Pokemon statement Pokemon previously announced a donation On June 3rd saying the company will make a hundred thousand dollar donation to n-double-a-cp and a hundred thousand donation to black lives matter we we talked about that last week I believe or the way up before last week this is the largest donation from a video game company to diverse causes since the death of George Floyd and the ongoing protests across the United States on Thursday Activision Blizzard made a minimum donation of two million dollars to similar causes and this weekend's Call of Duty event hosted by Minnesota Roker include strong fundraising component there's no amount of what they donated at the time but Greg are you friends with Minnesota Roker because I don't know that dude I'm pretty sure it's Minnesota rocker rocker got it and they have a so they're what call of duty call of duty call of duty lady okay they're the like local league and what's weird if you're ever down town when downtown opens again you can go to the Target Center building and sometimes they are in their little booth playing their game and it's like a fishbowl thing so you can watch these people just like every other worker is you don't know that they're doing something different it's just like they're quickly it looks like that quickly we're hangin spreadsheets but they're much more into it than everybody else who has open windows downtown but I believe that's them so the Minnesota rocker Call of Duty League is it because VGC could be an eSport that this is an ESPN or have all barriers just for news do we just not care anymore is it just yeah I guess that's news in itself that yes yeah reporting on this reporting on five million is a lot so between the Pokemon company and the antic that's ten million dollars and then on top of the Pokemon companies already two hundred thousand dollars I wonder if they wanted to do more but off the off the bat but there's probably a more legal hoops to jump through between yeah well yeah and they had to get they had to get the permission from Japan so possibly they were like given a small discretionary approval and then it was just like Oh everybody else is doing so much so then Japan was like heck yeah we'll do even more yeah it's awesome very cool and I'm assuming they're probably still doing research on where they want that money to go specifically because some charities had too much money and they were like redirecting to other causes yeah there are a lot in Minnesota that get way overwhelmed by how much money they we're getting and like it's great but they were definitely this please share please share the love so that they aren't sitting on piles of money that they have to report and deal with that they can't use immediately and there are other organizations that yes need it yes so I'm sure this won't be the last time we hear about this when we get closer to go fest I'm sure we will get a list of where that money is going and obviously holding these companies accountable not saying the Pokemon company is going to just say they're donating five million and not donate the five million but right that has been a thing in the past with other company ash will follow it just to hold them accountable and see where that goes because that's very generous of them speaking of Pokemon go we got some bad news and some good news bad news first alright Pokemon go to discontinue support on 32-bit Android devices oh no in an upcoming update to Pokemon go in the beginning of August 2020 we will end support of 32-bit Android device is by removing support for 32-bit Android devices we will be able to streamline our development process and focus resources on supporting newer operating systems and technology Android users on 64-bit devices and iOS users are not affected and do not need to take any action I think this is a big complaint with Pokemon masters because I believe Pokemon masters it's out the gate did not support 32-bit the Android device yeah I believe that's true here are some examples of 32-bit Android devices this is not the entire list this is off pokemon go live.com so if you have the following phones you will have to purchase a new phone before august to continue playing pokemon go alright if you have the samsung galaxy s4 s5 note 3 or j-3 if you have the Sony Xperia z2 or z3 if you have the motorola moto G first gen and if you have any Android device or at least before 2015 you will probably not be able to play pokemon go when this update rolls out trainers using these devices will no longer be able to access their go accounts from those devices including their coins their items you're using a 32-bit Android device you will need to a compatible 64-bit Android device or iOS device to continue playing pokemon go be sure to have your account info and passwords saved somewhere so you can log back in to your new device they do have an article to every device but I think here they just highlighted the most popular phones this is good yeah it's it's absolutely aníbal they can't maintain every mono of every phone for all eternity that just would be impossible and they don't list all the phones that help center they do have the oneplus one which I feel like is a pretty popular phone the HTC One and the over tour 3 I have not heard of that one what know what Samsung Galaxy are they on are they on like an s8 right now yeah Galaxy 9 I think okay now which was the one that blew up that was the eight that was I thought I was the note for no no no no no no it was the galaxy I think it was the eight yeah this is a thing like this has always been a thing as the person working in the telecom industry that was the note seven that blew up okay okay they get quickly tired of trying to back support the good news is generally stuff that is a couple of years old is pretty cheap to upgrade to often free because the companies involved want you to stay with them so they may have you sign a contract to get that thing for free so that you're guaranteeing service for them for two years so upgrading is made fairly easy by most phone companies because they want you to do it so check out you don't have to get the latest and greatest you can go a couple of years back and they're usually really good deals on those phones good news I guess is the Solstice event is returning again I was waiting to see what the good news was okay st. it and the bug out event we have more details so shiny Clefairy will arrive and lunatone and Solrock will be changing regions during the solstice themed event when i sounds like so locks only only during the event or in the event okay so if you missed your lunatone you'll have a limited time to catch it before it goes back to not the below the equator but on the other side of the shadow realm the shadow the shadow most of Europe and the Middle East yes to celebrate days getting longer in the northern hemisphere and nights doing the same in the southern Pokemon go solstice themed event will be back inta solstice is this actually timed correctly by June 20th 21st okay so it is time correctly ready for shiny Clefairy and more from Friday June 19th from 8 a.m. to Wednesday June 24th to 10 p.m. Pokemon associated with the Sun and Moon including Clefairy sunkern and more two winners more in a wild and they'll be hatching from 5k eggs appearing after completing the event exclusive field research and appearing in raids if you are lucky you may encounter a shiny Clefairy previously you could get a shiny Clefairy only by hatching a shiny cleffa and evolving it so this will be the first time you have a chance to encounter one in the wild throughout the event lunatone and Solrock will appear in both three-star raids hatching from five kegs regardless of your location lunatone and Solrock will be appearing the wild in different regions you can see the schedule below Oh weird they're like scheduling it out yeah from Friday June 19th to Saturday June 20th local time lunatone will appear more in the eastern hemisphere and Solrock in the Western Sunday June 21st to Monday June 22nd lunatone and Solrock will appear everywhere and then from Tuesday June 23rd to Wednesday June 24th lunatone and Solrock will be swapping and lunatone will be more frequent in the wild in the western and Solrock in the eastern when the event is over lunatone will stay in the Western that's us right mm-hmm little rock will stay in the eastern oh so they are swapping again yeah and you will get twice the amount of Stardust during this event and that's it that is the Solstice event details now we got the bug out event which will be Friday Friday June 26 to d'lai first bug type Pokemon including Scyther Venipede and dabble because it rhymes with pebble will be appearing more frequently in the wild hatching from 5k appearing an event exclusive research and if you're lucky you may encounter a shiny dweeb bug type Pokemon will be attracted to incense certain bug Pokemon appearing more than other when you use your incense so same thing with the well I guess they didn't say that those would be in the lunatone Solrock are not incense but from Friday June 26 to June 27th nincada nincada in que tienen que de III code nincada will be more attracted and then Sunday June 28th to June 29th wurmple will be more attracted and then June 30th to July 1st Scyther will be more attractive attracted to incense this event will have double catch XP and then to round it out there will be a pincer raid day on Sunday June 28th from 10:00 to 2:00 local time 3 star raids featuring pincer will be more common be sure to have it your remote raid packs passes stocked now I'm just gonna go out there and do them there will be a one coin bundle featuring three remote ray passes I thought they were done with one coin bundles they were advertising leave one coin bundle oh but I'll reserve it also on mine it says 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. 10:00 oh sorry I said with my man I misspoke 11 to 2 okay there's a trick with the right passes you can only hold three remote ray passes so you would not be able to buy this bundle if you have three but if you hold to remote ray passes you will be able to have you will be able to buy the bundle and you will be holding five but you can't buy it when you're holding three you have to be holding zero one or two to buy the bundle so just a heads up if you have three you're like why can't i buy this bundle you have to use at least one you're allowed to go over but you're not allowed to go over when you're at max which is three in this case though you'll be able to hold five it's very confusing just just know that that's that's the trick around it I would probably buy the the three ray passes for a coin I think that's pretty good I think that's pretty alright that's a good one I guess I didn't have this in my news but go battle league is shut down again for cheating oh those cheaters ruin everything who cheated whoever you are stopped cheating and there's no ETA of when it comes back up but there was from my understanding I didn't investigate too much into it there was a handful of people that found an exploit used the exploit they then got banned off the leaderboard because they were very very highly ranked as you know Pokemon go-live has a leaderboard feature now and then people continue to do it so then they just shut down the entire gold medal I don't know if that was a permanent ban for those people though I would assume so I feel like if you're exploiting official competition I don't see why they would have you back I know I agree last bit of news here there's a new tournament speaking of tournaments for a sword and shield it is the international friendly online competition no ball shirt this time though yeah I'm out ah Pass pass hard pass this competition will run from June 25th through June 28th it will use similar rules to the championships format if you do at least one battle you will get 50 battle points pretty good that I can buy you two ability capsules I think there are 25 sounds about right you can sign up now and you can sign up anytime between June 10th through June 25th same way you've signed up for any events you open sword and shield you go to the first menu battle stadium online competition search for online competition also players may receive penalties and be restricted from participating in future competitions if there is a significant large number of disconnects during the battle I guess they have not fixed that starting from when your opponent decides until the match results I've been fully sent to the server please ensure a stable connection when you are connecting to the internet I'm doing my best I think if you everyone disconnect that's probably not that big of a deal if that's my one battle that I'm using to get my points it is a big deal I want to fight somebody else I feel like if well I think you can say this for any fandom slash event slash world thing I feel like if kovat wasn't a thing Pokemon would be having a heck of a year right now yeah true yeah they would be there just really killing it with TCG stuff and and the VGC stuff was so healthy before kovat cancelled all the tournaments and they're merged they're like continuing to release new merch almost on a weekly basis in Pokemon Center anime just hit the ground for a lot of companies who are like Pokemon hit Pokemon shifted really fast like they were on it and I think I think they've at least helped stop the major impact like it's not the same but I think they pivoted faster than a lot of other companies did yeah which is weird cuz normally but I think like if you look at what they had planned for 2020 I think a lot of what they had planned for releases for products fit into our new model of living better than most companies like they had two DLCs already set up all these products to teach people how to play TCG don't require you to go to a game store to get them and like they can say hey families do this so I think all right ahead they were primed to be able to change base off of what they had already planned for 2020 this is the first attempt at DLC I hope it's good I I don't know at this point I'm going to be good he's going to be good I hate sword and shield and I can tell you this is gonna be good I don't know if it converts any national dexter's right like to bad trash out the door with you well I'm here with the fun folks who know how to enjoy life well we also okay so national Dexter's aside which is you know as we saw with sales a tiny tiny very tiny culture a very loud portion very tiny portion well that's how they get you we do know that our players that skip the first generation right why by why by diamond and pearl when we know that platinum would be a better version of that why by Sun and Moon when we know there's normally a third version y by x and y when oh wait um but there-there are fans that do wait because normally the the third version is the better version and you know they don't want to pay $40 for a game and then the next year pay $40 for ultimately the same game which is I I don't think anyone's arguing that the original game was ever better than the third version feature wise you can maybe argue that the story is better so I'm really really curious if you know this DLC comes out it has you know bouffalant in it somebody's favorite Pokemon all-time is booth Alliant they see boo Flint's walking around the wild they were really unsure because of national Dexter's that they wanted to buy the game if they're going to purchase it and purchase the DLC and enjoy it you know there's probably another audience that heard that there's not anything to do once you beat the game so it's not worth the 60 bucks is this going to add enough where they feel compelled to buy it go through beat Leon then explore everything that there is to offer it's a really exciting but like nerve-wracking time and see if this is going to do what they wanted to do I mean I don't think that if they were unwilling to spend $60 that they're now willing to spend $90 exactly yes like those people are those people aren't coming back I think some national Dexter's will like will say oh we'll use the addition of pokeman as an excuse to do what they wanted to do all along let's play the game I think it gives them a way in to say oh well now more coming back and they've shown up up up up ah and they can say is my point still stands but I'm gonna try the game now I still think that was such a small amount of people I think the bigger concern is how these go right like if the DLCs ultimately Ares like we're very dissatisfied with both DLCs and this would be really hard if this first one doesn't at least shine for people to think I want to come back for the second one so like there's a lot that sort of rides on this first one that I'm hoping they put a lot enough in that people are enthused to wait for the next one in November and I've said this in the past too I think I think I was very vocal around the time of X&Y about this is like I I didn't want Pokemon to turn into like a Call of Duty or a at the time I think it was like rock band or you were getting a game every single year mm-hmm and that affects that can affect the quality of the game so because we're technically not getting a new game this year are these DLC is gonna be good enough are they gonna feel like they're worth the $30 total is it going to you know if ideally we're getting a game the fall of 2021 which I guess would be the pattern although the Pokemon company's proven their patterns are very hard to follow yeah what happens you know after November or ultimately a full year with sword and shield do we get a final DLC do we get nothing do we get I mean I think also there should be perception of you're buying two for $30 but everybody's going to judge the first one off of the full price because if it's terrible then I could probably gonna play the second one and they'll still have that perception of I paid $30 for this so I'm really I'm really hoping the deal the first DLC has a lot to it and it feels very vibrant so that you feel like oh I'm getting a lot for $30 and I get something in November I'm afraid that they may have taken the approach of a loaded with $15 and $15.63 where I did a lot of competitive so sudden mood ultramoon where did they fall for you towards the bottom I think that's like the start if when things started to go bad okay so as somebody who didn't enjoy sword and shield purchased the DLC oh heck yeah what what would be the what would put sword and shield above the games you did like like what is something that would make it feel good to you in either this this expansion or maybe hopefully in the second one like how could they redeem themselves yeah oh I think that horse has left the barn I I mean if they improve like the the main issue I I can focus on now because it's like just the thing that I'm since I'm trying to complete my pokedex much like you I I would like to have a living decks in sword and shield before I move forward the fact that there's just not not that very clear path to finding all of the Pokemon and like when I like went through my pokedex and I was like oh here's all the ones that I missing and then I went through bla bla pedia to see like oh do I have to have them traded from shield or can I find them in-game and there was like a heck Donavan that actually do exist in sword but number one prime annoyance only in the wild area that is completely aggravating to me but then number two it's just like in the wild area at certain weather conditions I'm like oh you're gonna make me just sit and wait for the weather to change to hope and a number three gripe back to back to our roots I don't know if other people notice this but if you click on the Pokedex in sword and shield it comes up with a here's the next Pokemon we think you should yeah yeah yeah sure and then when you capture that Pokemon if it's the one that your pokedex is recommending it's like pokedex completion update hooray I there are pokemon in sword in the game that i could be getting that my pokedex no long it doesn't bother to say hey you should be looking for this one it does all it says is let's find Pokemon I'm like that is so I don't want to use bad words but that is so half donkey in execution but but here's the thing I love armor I know what I took SPECT going in so I'm I will work around these limitations and shortcomings and I will enjoy myself because how refreshing to have new Pokemon content in the middle of the year you know the summer - it's just like new and it's it's actual like not a side game anything like that it's it's actual just Pokemon content and it's an extension of my Pokemon sword that is just wonderful and at that I'm very happy about I was lucky enough for a Nintendo treehouse and the Pokemon continued to invite me on a pokémon showcase this past weekend and while we were going through rehearsal they were they were asking you know what I was familiar with in Pokemon certain Pokemon shield which is everything at this point but when they were like hey are you do you want to explain the cooking session I would be like yeah I love to like I completed my curry decks like I thought that was fun and I would love to be a person to be like hey if you don't know what to do in soren shield or maybe you didn't buy it like this is a cool thing that the game has if you like collecting stuff and when I was like going through my berries it was just really funny to hear the two Nintendo treehouse employees go holy cow you have that many so and then like they wanted me to go through the competitive stuff and they were like you have 15 golden bottle caps and it's like well I've done you know master rank every season and they give you three when you hit master rank and I just I hoard a lot of items but for me it's like really exciting to go into a new area of the game with a hundred new Pokemon and like not have that feeling of well all my battle points are useless all my wats are useless all my money Zeus's cuz you're so used to in these Pokemon games going like well I gotta collect all the fire stones again and the reaper cloths and the bottle caps and it seems more it seems just to make sense with current games to be like I don't have to do this all again so I'm excited to see that area and just a heads up because I still see people say this these Pokemon are not behind a paywall if you decide not to get the expansion because you're waiting for people's thoughts on it you want to see if it's worth it etc you have to do the update that'll be for everyone the sword and shield update but once that update hits if you want a bouffalant in sword and shield not the expansion you can either move in your bouffalant from Pokemon home or somebody can trade it to you or you can get it wonder traded nothing restricts that bouffalant in the expansion from you having it in the game you don't have to pay for anything also if somebody is doing a abyssal raid which I'm assuming will probably be a thing new pokemon in raid in the isle of armor even if you don't have the DLC you can still join and participate in that raid you just can't host the raid because obviously you're not in that area to see it but you can still join it you can still participate in it you can still catch it without paying $30 so there is no pay wall to these Pokemon unless you consider even cup foo the legendary Pokemon you get for free somebody could just trade you a cup foo and you're good you have it that's still getting thrown around that these Pokemon are behind a paywall the raids are behind the paywall none of that none of that is behind a paywall tell a friend I guess I don't know I think that's all we have for news let me just check the attic channel shout out to James for sending in the five million dollar donation Brandon with the reminder of the ghoul Aryan Meowth mystery gift Greg will do our question of the week question of the week we've got all the answers you seek yeah question of the week come on everybody and sing yeah I mean that's nice mm-hmm this is from Robert says if you have a chance to make a minigame for a pokémon's if you haven't 30 what would it go No oh yeah oh I hmm what has already been done what has already been done all right well you guys think about that there there was there was an interview I think it was in Eurogamer like three or four years ago and it was something along the lines of like would you make a pokemon stadium three these are always the questions would you make a Pokemon snap would you make a pokemon stadium three and they said the reason they they don't feel like they need to make a pokemon stadium three is because pokemon stadium was the way to see your 2d Pokemon in 3d right and because of X&Y they don't have to do that anymore but nostalgia is strong it is strong at this one and I would love a minigame collection and there are new Pokemon to make minigames around that's true that's true I think I mean III want here here you go ready idea number one golden drag a pole target-shooting throw those Droopys at the target yes get both darts uh-huh viral ball fetch okay all right you could have a you could have a mini game where booth lamp gets doused by water and you got a brush out its afro how boring fast no in Packham oh yeah smack the wind pod because it's always trying to run away from you I still think there's a market one for mini games Pokemon minigames but two I still think there's a market and they could probably just do this in certain chill they probably don't have to make a third version but it would be cool if there was an app or a game where you could just watch people battle I open up the app it's called twitch yeah I guess yeah it's called to itch I guess but clash Royale had this and I think it was good I mean clash Royale not the pinnacle of gaming here no when Greg was doing a battle in clash Royale it was very cool to join it and watch it and then you could like cheer from the side it was yes it's cool and you know if you are somebody who can't go to twitch or don't want to deal with chat or commentary that was like a cool thing well okay let's talk about twitch like twitch plays pokemon have sometimes they have like just pokémon battle revolution battles and it's just kind of fun to watch the computer randomly battle each other and be like oh I think the team with the Latios and the Clefairy is gonna beat the team with the right earier and the Sandile but I yeah I don't I don't I mean probably based off battle Revolution sales alone I don't know if there's an actual market for that but spectating and watching battles as seen on twitch is definitely there's definitely a demand for that I don't know pokemon stadium was like a full package though it had like your free battles yep it had the Gameboy player had minigames it had the gym leader tower it had a way to unlock surfing Pikachu it was pretty fleshed out yeah Stadium 2 was the same thing but in like this literally the same areas but just different minigames and more Pokemon wind pod whack-a-mole I like it well what was our Pokemon of the week all right so last week's Pokemon of the week if you're not a fan of Jay Z and Rick Rubin maybe you missed it I thought I put enough words in there that would make make it clear I think the number one clue which most people may have missed out on is the number 99 but I also mentioned things like having a Crabby mood I also had like moves like crabhammer razor shell and guillotine that it's basically a mana water type what more do you need who's that pokémon it's Lance oh not with this with a lot a lot like five years ago it's Kingler kingler you are correct it's Giganta max kingler with a super cool beard with the Santa Claus Santa Santa kingler San together st. kingler Singler that's a very Minnesota thing yeah good shuffle icon Hinkler shares the same category with scissors they're both known as the pincer Pokemon although scissor was originally called the scissors Pokemon wait I didn't know they retcon that huh interesting huh oh there you go I reckon Arcanine for being the legendary Pokemon please they cannot a kingler x' national dex number and Galler pokedex number in sword and shield are the same they are both 99 huh let's go trivia that'll be on like a trivia bar night which Pokemon yeah sure so did king they're shiny get less green over time I think it's pretty green and sword and shield both pedia just doesn't have sword and shield shiny sprites sprites models I think they're models now technically now I have no idea that's magic and witchcraft to me at least is not like every gligar where they yeah no I think I think the 3d models just tend to have the colors a B they're a bit more washed out yeah well the 3ds definitely on the Samus which ever feel like I feel like the colors are pretty alright do you have anything else about English has a gigantic max form pretty cool yeah it's got a bubble beard because it's a bubble bearded King king crab I got nothing else in this week's go boss yeah I'm ready I'm ready all right Steve you may have a chance Greg Greg possibly not oh I'm I'm I'm I am taking advantage of the huge rifts in our community this week for my own personal entertainment as the cruel human that I am would be wanted to do here we go some cards will never stand a chance there is just nothing they can do to become someone's favorite card think about Pokemon that have to be evolved in game especially stage twos there used to be a card in the game rare candy that allowed you to bypass stage one completely this week's Pokemon was most recently featured in the Sun and Moon ultra prism set which came out in English on February 2nd 2018 it has a single attack for one fire energy super singe attacked us 20 damage and inflicts the burned special condition when a Pokemon receives this special condition in the TCG the burned pokemon takes two damage at the start of each turn then the player who has that as their pokemon flips a coin to see if they are cured or whether the burned condition continues the cards flavor text reads it uses ceilings and walls to launch aerial attacks its fiery tail is but one weapon I do wish to be clear that the text does not state that its tail is one but weapon although that would be not being correct if you do succeed in evolving this week's Pokemon into its stage to form it will gain the ability flaming fighter put six damage counters instead of to on your opponent's burned Pokemon between turns all right there you go all you TCG players have fun we will be back next week with I guess our thoughts of the DLC yeah I'll be about 5 minutes into it at that point perfect I will be streaming all of the DLC on twitch.tv / PK m and c AST same as
