trailer (8:07 - 8:12)
we got DeLorean Slowbro yeah with this (8:08 - 8:15)
pinchy Megaman arm they that's what it (8:12 - 8:18)
is it is Megaman yeah they're a poison (8:15 - 8:21)
psychic pokémon which has never been (8:18 - 8:22)
done before right (8:21 - 8:26)
yes I believe this is our first I don't (8:22 - 8:27)
know we got to be careful when we say (8:26 - 8:28)
these things because somebody always (8:27 - 8:30)
finds that one bruh bomb be out there (8:28 - 8:32)
and then like wow before I can't believe (8:30 - 8:38)
I forgot that okay so a shelter by (8:32 - 8:41)
shelter bite set off a chemical reaction (8:38 - 8:44)
with the species inside glarey and (8:41 - 8:46)
slowpokes body causing gallery' and slow (8:44 - 8:50)
bro the gain the poison type the shelter (8:46 - 8:52)
latched onto Slowbro sometime (8:50 - 8:54)
unconsciously bites our harder and (8:52 - 8:54)
harder (8:54 - 8:56)
bites down harder on slow burrows arm (8:54 - 9:00)
causing an itch that drives Slowbro to (8:56 - 9:02)
start wildly swinging its arms and (9:00 - 9:05)
smashing its surroundings with a speed (9:02 - 9:07)
that puts it that puts even the quickest (9:05 - 9:10)
reflexes shame slow bro readies its (9:07 - 9:12)
shelter and makes a poisonous liquid (9:10 - 9:16)
shoot from shelters tip this shell side (9:12 - 9:18)
arm a POI (9:16 - 9:20)
type special move may poison the target (9:18 - 9:23)
the move will either inflict physical or (9:20 - 9:25)
special damage depending on which does (9:23 - 9:29)
more damage to the target ooh yeah (9:25 - 9:31)
that's wild (9:29 - 9:33)
very interesting I'm gonna say I'm a bit (9:31 - 9:35)
disappointed of the trailer I thought we (9:33 - 9:40)
were gonna get at least one new Pokemon (9:35 - 9:42)
or another gallery and Pokemon we (9:40 - 9:44)
haven't seen before I guess we haven't (9:42 - 9:47)
seen Slowbro but we knew that we knew (9:44 - 9:50)
coming we also hadn't seen any animation (9:47 - 9:53)
of our Shifu and the foosh nickens or (9:50 - 9:56)
whatever the health issues are oh we've (9:53 - 10:01)
seen come foo the evolutions whatever (9:56 - 10:03)
OSHA food turns into Oh OSHA feel like (10:01 - 10:05)
fighting stands form and Ursa food water (10:03 - 10:08)
wait what's the baby oh is the baby cub (10:05 - 10:11)
okay so that's what I meant we saw cub (10:08 - 10:15)
foo and it's evolutions that's new I (10:11 - 10:17)
just I don't know that we're getting (10:15 - 10:21)
more glaring forms in this one well okay (10:17 - 10:24)
so if the leaker didn't spoil everything (10:21 - 10:26)
technically before sword shield came out (10:24 - 10:29)
we had no clue about corsola we had no (10:26 - 10:32)
clue about Dhara mukha or maka sorry (10:29 - 10:35)
whatever we knew far fetch we knew po (10:32 - 10:38)
neeta what other glaring Pokemon am I (10:35 - 10:40)
missing right now meows we didn't know (10:38 - 10:42)
about me Althea that was that was (10:40 - 10:45)
spoiled and then in terms obviously (10:42 - 10:48)
jerker we knew we knew easing if they're (10:45 - 10:50)
doing the same approach where one of (10:48 - 10:52)
these would now actually now that I'm (10:50 - 10:53)
saying that that would be really smart (10:52 - 10:55)
because they know not that no one can (10:53 - 10:56)
spoil it (10:55 - 11:00)
yeah so why show it right so I take that (10:56 - 11:02)
back I would be I would actually be (11:00 - 11:04)
disappointed with the dlc if we didn't (11:02 - 11:06)
get like at least one more besides the (11:04 - 11:09)
slowpoke yeah I mean they had already (11:06 - 11:12)
hinted to this to the slowpoke and (11:09 - 11:14)
Slowking like they've hinted to that so (11:12 - 11:17)
it makes sense that they showed it but I (11:14 - 11:20)
think there's probably I think I hope (11:17 - 11:22)
definitely hope that there's more hidden (11:20 - 11:26)
yeah I have to I think there will be (11:22 - 11:28)
yeah especially the (11:26 - 11:32)
because it's DLC yeah yeah I think and (11:28 - 11:34)
people people lose their minds of a (11:32 - 11:37)
Pokemon people were pretty pumped about (11:34 - 11:40)
course Allah and Daraa mukha and stuff (11:37 - 11:43)
yeah so I think that's like really (11:40 - 11:46)
that's like a real easy uh what's the (11:43 - 11:49)
expression real easy fish to shoot like (11:46 - 11:56)
shooting fish in a barrel was painful (11:49 - 11:57)
recording ever (11:56 - 12:00)
it's like slam dunking fish into a (11:57 - 12:06)
barrel you there you go okay now this (12:00 - 12:12)
this the sword game has the boy no the (12:06 - 12:15)
girl the pet hair girl and the shield (12:12 - 12:18)
game has the psychic boy right (12:15 - 12:24)
Oh trainers women I thought no no ii did (12:18 - 12:27)
the psychic dude the dude yeah Avery (12:24 - 12:31)
Avery Avery although originally listed (12:27 - 12:36)
as non-binary is listed as he upon the (12:31 - 12:41)
website now yes Clara is listed as Mara (12:36 - 12:46)
Clara so she is poison and he is psychic (12:41 - 12:49)
and in the trailer they show (12:46 - 12:53)
Avery's Pokemon Slowbro Dynomax but is (12:49 - 12:57)
the conclusion I'm jumping to is they (12:53 - 12:59)
both have the Slowbro right because yeah (12:57 - 13:02)
I think they both oh yes love ro I think (12:59 - 13:05)
that was like the big hint that like if (13:02 - 13:06)
we had been reading between the lines (13:05 - 13:08)
that would have made sense that the (13:06 - 13:10)
Slowbro is psychic poisoned because of (13:08 - 13:12)
the two characters they both show up (13:10 - 13:15)
with the slow group they show up with (13:12 - 13:16)
the so poke was right in front of us the (13:15 - 13:19)
entire times it was there we didn't (13:16 - 13:22)
connect the dots I feel like I've left (13:19 - 13:24)
the let the listeners down they were the (13:22 - 13:31)
real Pokemon of the week no that was (13:24 - 13:32)
chat hot oh right (13:31 - 13:36)
Duncan the chat taught into a barrel of (13:32 - 13:42)
fish barrel of fish Giganta Max Vina (13:36 - 13:46)
soare and Giganta mac Blastoise the (13:42 - 13:48)
power of Giganta maxing has made veena (13:46 - 13:51)
sores flower bloomed so large that it (13:48 - 13:53)
covers the pokemons body during battle (13:51 - 13:55)
the pokemon uses these petals as a (13:53 - 13:59)
shield and swings it's too thick vines (13:55 - 14:02)
around to thrash the target grass type (13:59 - 14:05)
attacks used by Giganta max venusaur (14:02 - 14:10)
will change to G max vine lash G max (14:05 - 14:13)
vine lash doesn't all just doesnt deal (14:10 - 14:15)
damage to the opponent it will continue (14:13 - 14:17)
to deal damage for four turns any (14:15 - 14:19)
Pokemon that isn't a grass type that's (14:17 - 14:23)
exactly the same as Charizard G max move (14:19 - 14:26)
except grass and stuff fire blasts (14:23 - 14:29)
noises shell has grown to match its body (14:26 - 14:31)
and it boasts new extra-large cannons as (14:29 - 14:32)
well (14:31 - 14:34)
giganto max Blastoise can adapt to (14:32 - 14:36)
different situations by using different (14:34 - 14:38)
combinations of it thirty-one various (14:36 - 14:41)
sized cannons Giganta max blasteroids (14:38 - 14:44)
can also move the 12 large cannons (14:41 - 14:45)
surrounding its central cannon (14:44 - 14:48)
independently letting it orient its (14:45 - 14:50)
attack in any direction whether in the (14:48 - 14:54)
ground or sky water type attacks used by (14:50 - 14:56)
G max Giganta max blasteroids will (14:54 - 15:00)
change to G max cannonade oh it's like (14:56 - 15:04)
lemonade but with the word cannon and (15:00 - 15:07)
it's the same as it's the same as the (15:04 - 15:09)
other ones he figured it out it does (15:07 - 15:12)
water type damage it's very hard for me (15:09 - 15:14)
to look at Giganta max Blastoise and (15:12 - 15:16)
Giganta max venusaur and think these are (15:14 - 15:18)
significantly better than their mega (15:16 - 15:21)
evolutions yeah they're really good I (15:18 - 15:24)
just wished like they had a better idea (15:21 - 15:27)
for Blastoise instead of let's we made (15:24 - 15:31)
big cannons before let's make thousands (15:27 - 15:35)
of cannon I know it's just like now it's (15:31 - 15:38)
like could you maybe do something like (15:35 - 15:41)
you gave Moltres at night mulches you (15:38 - 15:45)
gave venusaur a terrible haircut it's (15:41 - 15:47)
just bad haircut it's like a Beatles (15:45 - 15:49)
haircut but worse do something more (15:47 - 15:51)
interesting for Blastoise than all the (15:49 - 15:53)
cannons that ever existed in the world (15:51 - 15:56)
right now I just don't think it's (15:53 - 15:58)
I mean it will probably look really cool (15:56 - 16:02)
in battle but I was sort of hoping it (15:58 - 16:07)
looked more different than its mega form (16:02 - 16:10)
yeah I one thing I just like since the (16:07 - 16:12)
moves are kind of like all the same it's (16:10 - 16:16)
more it's just like a graphical change (16:12 - 16:18)
but I mean at least we finally got them (16:16 - 16:22)
so all the venusaur stands and Blastoise (16:18 - 16:26)
stands can Dynomax Giganta max get what (16:22 - 16:29)
they need so now that not all those (16:26 - 16:31)
Bulbasaur that I caught in those dens (16:29 - 16:33)
with hidden abilities I can raise and (16:31 - 16:36)
make them Giganta Max's I mean Venus (16:33 - 16:38)
already seeing a lot of competitive play (16:36 - 16:44)
yeah it's uh it's it's a fast Pokemon I (16:38 - 16:46)
didn't realize how fast Venus or was (16:44 - 16:49)
when the Sun is up (16:46 - 16:53)
ability yeah ability makes its ability (16:49 - 16:55)
its hidden ability like doubles at speed (16:53 - 16:58)
in the Sun yeah it's is it it's (16:55 - 17:00)
chlorophyll is Ziggler chlorophyll I (16:58 - 17:02)
thinking and then it makes it I'll (17:00 - 17:06)
always remember that you know you think (17:02 - 17:08)
you think a giant grass frog would be (17:06 - 17:10)
pretty slow you think it normally it is (17:08 - 17:13)
but when you get the Sun when it doubles (17:10 - 17:15)
its speed in the Sun you go oh my orchid (17:13 - 17:16)
I'm it has to be faster than this giant (17:15 - 17:21)
frog nope nope it's a toad it's not a (17:16 - 17:22)
frog my bad (17:21 - 17:26)
like putting frogs in a bathtub basket (17:22 - 17:29)
yeah so it doubles in speed in its speed (17:26 - 17:33)
honestly venusaur speed is not terrible (17:29 - 17:37)
like I mean it starts at an 80 speed so (17:33 - 17:41)
it's normal fo its normal form is much (17:37 - 17:44)
slower than a lot of things but yeah if (17:41 - 17:49)
you can get sunset up 160 speed (17:44 - 17:49)
flying yeah well and also the speed is (17:50 - 17:55)
kind of like in how it's whipping around (17:54 - 17:58)
all them pedals and stuff it's not (17:55 - 17:59)
necessarily running around and doing (17:58 - 18:03)
stuff it doesn't have to it's got its (17:59 - 18:07)
Beatles haircut and it's going nowhere (18:03 - 18:12)
I'm sure Venusaur will think venusaur (18:07 - 18:14)
was already top ten used or maybe top 20 (18:12 - 18:16)
used but I'm sure it'll shoot up even (18:14 - 18:19)
more when it's has a dedicated Giganta (18:16 - 18:23)
max form yeah I mean it's it is going to (18:19 - 18:24)
dominate in a lot of ways I think yeah (18:23 - 18:26)
we'll talk about the hidden abilities (18:24 - 18:29)
for the gen8 starters but cinder ace (18:26 - 18:32)
went from cinder a cinder ah-choo a (18:29 - 18:35)
thank you maybe top a hundred to number (18:32 - 18:39)
one in less than a week but I mean the (18:35 - 18:42)
ability is so good that is it's like (18:39 - 18:44)
when are we gonna get a grass-type that (18:42 - 18:45)
has that ability because now we've got a (18:44 - 18:47)
water-type that does and a fire-type (18:45 - 18:50)
that does yeah i till didn't i'm i have (18:47 - 18:54)
a candidate you know it has to be a (18:50 - 18:57)
starter (18:54 - 19:01)
so unless candidate when we get to (18:57 - 19:04)
Canada we get a rosary starter a little (19:01 - 19:07)
buddy who starter often so cute cute (19:04 - 19:10)
legendary Pokemon Oh Shi Fu's exclusive (19:07 - 19:13)
moves the legendary Pokemon (19:10 - 19:15)
oh she foo has two forms single strike (19:13 - 19:18)
style and rapid strike style each form (19:15 - 19:20)
can learn different moves and GMAX moves (19:18 - 19:24)
a single strikes I'll style her Shifu (19:20 - 19:27)
that has followed the path of darkness (19:24 - 19:32)
Oh hmm I can unleash a single severe (19:27 - 19:36)
blow a signature move called wicked blow (19:32 - 19:39)
it's a wicked blow this move has this (19:36 - 19:41)
move will always result in a critical (19:39 - 19:44)
hit allowing a Shifu to attack while (19:41 - 19:46)
ignoring this targets stat changes a (19:44 - 19:50)
rapid strike style / Shifu that has (19:46 - 19:52)
followed the path of water and unleash a (19:50 - 19:56)
flowing three hit combo a signature move (19:52 - 19:59)
known as surging strikes the move will (19:56 - 20:03)
always result in a critical hit allowing (19:59 - 20:04)
wait a minute (20:03 - 20:08)
yeah allowing us you food to attack (20:04 - 20:10)
while ignoring the stat changes it's the (20:08 - 20:12)
same move is just one burst or three (20:10 - 20:17)
yeah the three is handy for focus shash (20:12 - 20:23)
our mimic you our mimic you or ice kyun (20:17 - 20:27)
although actually a fighting-type move (20:23 - 20:32)
wouldn't hit mimic you so there you go (20:27 - 20:33)
well it's not so good is it (20:32 - 20:35)
but I mean is it fighting us at water (20:33 - 20:39)
out there everyone doesn't feel like (20:35 - 20:41)
wicked below is gonna be a dark-type (20:39 - 20:44)
movie and surging strikes will be a (20:41 - 20:46)
water-type mode so if it is water type (20:44 - 20:48)
than it is okay against mimic you unseen (20:46 - 20:50)
fist is the new ability introduced in (20:48 - 20:54)
these expansions and one that only (20:50 - 20:57)
single strike her Shifu and rapid strike (20:54 - 21:00)
her Shifu possess for now this ability (20:57 - 21:03)
lets pokemon deal damage when it attacks (21:00 - 21:06)
with moves that make direct contact even (21:03 - 21:09)
if the target defends itself by using a (21:06 - 21:11)
move like protect (21:09 - 21:14)
yeah Oh get rekt (21:11 - 21:18)
this is this is a huge thing I long for (21:14 - 21:19)
the days when protect used to mean (21:18 - 21:23)
something they can't peace cannot be put (21:19 - 21:26)
into actual VGC right they seem really (21:23 - 21:30)
good oh well I mean if they're (21:26 - 21:34)
legendaries then probably am NOT yeah I (21:30 - 21:36)
know I don't know how they're gonna I (21:34 - 21:37)
don't know how they're gonna categorize (21:36 - 21:40)
them the only one legendary that's a to (21:37 - 21:41)
Legendary's that are allowed right now (21:40 - 21:45)
or tight null and so Val I I think that (21:41 - 21:46)
all the rest of them are decks filler (21:45 - 21:49)
yeah well the only other Legendary's are (21:46 - 21:52)
a Sheehan and Zama Zetas and they're (21:49 - 21:57)
banned that ability means you know the (21:52 - 22:00)
practice of protecting to scout what (21:57 - 22:05)
they have is not possible if a Shifu is (22:00 - 22:06)
on the field (22:05 - 22:09)
do you I mean what having watched you (22:06 - 22:10)
since I don't know competitive you can (22:09 - 22:13)
usually guess who's gonna protect a (22:10 - 22:16)
scout so maybe I don't know maybe they (22:13 - 22:19)
will because maybe they I wanna put the (22:16 - 22:23)
threat of scouting make that more (22:19 - 22:24)
dangerous I don't know (22:23 - 22:27)
dark type attacks used by single strike (22:24 - 22:32)
style Jeff single strike style Giganta (22:27 - 22:35)
Maxie a few will change to G max one (22:32 - 22:38)
blow (22:35 - 22:38)
moving on water type attacks used by (22:38 - 22:45)
rapid strikes I'll Giganta max her Shifu (22:41 - 22:50)
will change to G max rapid flow G max (22:45 - 22:53)
one blow and G max rapid flow can deal (22:50 - 22:56)
damage even if the target defends itself (22:53 - 23:00)
by using max guard or protect isn't the (22:56 - 23:02)
max guard one the important one yeah cuz (23:00 - 23:04)
max guard will block will block (23:02 - 23:07)
everything but protect if used G max (23:04 - 23:11)
move or a dynamics move on a protect it (23:07 - 23:12)
still did damage right yeah they'll do (23:11 - 23:15)
chip damage unless crazy boosts or (23:12 - 23:18)
they're like four times a week you can (23:15 - 23:20)
maybe break through a protect but (23:18 - 23:22)
otherwise protect well it will prevent (23:20 - 23:25)
most of the G max or Dynomax move (23:22 - 23:31)
usually so yeah this I mean boy I don't (23:25 - 23:32)
know what they're gonna do (23:31 - 23:34)
I mean they could have been watching (23:32 - 23:37)
over the last seven months or so and (23:34 - 23:39)
said you know we really need something (23:37 - 23:43)
to threaten the protection and the max (23:39 - 23:46)
guard and they may put them in I mean (23:43 - 23:50)
it's yeah it's just like protect is such (23:46 - 23:53)
a key element of the strategy in in (23:50 - 23:56)
competitive VGC like to completely (23:53 - 23:59)
obliterate it well then again like (23:56 - 24:01)
they've they really done after trick (23:59 - 24:02)
room maybe not all the other stuff yeah (24:01 - 24:05)
and we don't know their stats right we (24:02 - 24:09)
don't know that they will have the stats (24:05 - 24:14)
to make that worth it yeah we also don't (24:09 - 24:15)
know their move pool I mean yeah we (24:14 - 24:18)
don't know the move pool these specific (24:15 - 24:19)
moves make (24:18 - 24:23)
or protect but and there are other moves (24:19 - 24:25)
that ignore protect so it's not like (24:23 - 24:27)
this is completely under well sorry (24:25 - 24:29)
their abilities well yeah their ability (24:27 - 24:31)
makes all their moves ignore protect I (24:29 - 24:35)
guess never mind well provided it makes (24:31 - 24:37)
direct contact that's an important part (24:35 - 24:41)
so they could only have a few direct (24:37 - 24:44)
contact moves like we do pool really (24:41 - 24:48)
tell us exactly how viable they are okay (24:44 - 24:49)
they start some other stuff in the (24:48 - 24:52)
island of armored trailer or I guess it (24:49 - 24:55)
was a trailer for both but they showed (24:52 - 24:58)
Tudor moves completely new Tudor moves (24:55 - 25:00)
will be available on the island armored (24:58 - 25:02)
trainers can have their Pokemon learn (25:00 - 25:05)
them in the exchange of armor right or a (25:02 - 25:08)
substance that can be found on the isle (25:05 - 25:10)
of armor through match rays and other (25:08 - 25:14)
means another currency yet another (25:10 - 25:18)
currency so max raids and other means (25:14 - 25:21)
which probably just means do max raids (25:18 - 25:24)
and maybe once every three months we'll (25:21 - 25:27)
give you a couple through mystery gift (25:24 - 25:30)
maybe through camping maybe burning (25:27 - 25:33)
jealousy is a new fire type move that (25:30 - 25:34)
can be taught with these these (25:33 - 25:37)
expansions when it hits it will deal (25:34 - 25:41)
damage to all opposing pokemon and burn (25:37 - 25:43)
all opposing pokemon that have their (25:41 - 25:47)
stats boosted in that turn hmm grassy (25:43 - 25:50)
glide is a new grass type move that can (25:47 - 25:52)
be taught during these expansion this (25:50 - 25:55)
move has a high priority when used on (25:52 - 25:58)
grassy terrain that one doesn't sound as (25:55 - 26:01)
good no that's not exciting no water (25:58 - 26:03)
move they talk about here but I'm sure (26:01 - 26:05)
there probably will be one maybe not I (26:03 - 26:09)
don't know max soup max soup is a (26:05 - 26:11)
special dish made from rare ingredients (26:09 - 26:13)
that you can gather on the island of (26:11 - 26:21)
armor with great hidden potential drinks (26:13 - 26:23)
max soup I don't know what I don't know (26:21 - 26:25)
if that actually means anything if a (26:23 - 26:26)
Pokemon with great hidden potential (26:25 - 26:30)
drinks max soup it will become a special (26:26 - 26:33)
Pokemon capable of Giganta maxing I (26:30 - 26:35)
what they're saying is the hidden (26:33 - 26:38)
potential since not every pokémon can (26:35 - 26:41)
Giganta max or hazard again - max form (26:38 - 26:45)
pretend yeah so so you can convert a (26:41 - 26:49)
regular Pokemon to a gigantic max 1 by (26:45 - 26:52)
feeding it the soup but only but they're (26:49 - 26:54)
saying like Pikachu has great hidden (26:52 - 26:58)
potential but Chikorita does not have (26:54 - 27:03)
done potential and never never do that (26:58 - 27:06)
but it's like for me it's like every (27:03 - 27:08)
time I've done a gigantic max car burger (27:06 - 27:11)
raid I like don't catch the Garbo derp (27:08 - 27:14)
so I can just take my regular Garbo tour (27:11 - 27:17)
and just give it some soup and finally (27:14 - 27:19)
have that speech I can to max car voter (27:17 - 27:22)
yeah yeah I mean if you you know didn't (27:19 - 27:26)
want to go on eBay and pay a dollar 99 (27:22 - 27:29)
for a square shiny legit ultra Charizard (27:26 - 27:32)
holding for master balls 500 sold and (27:29 - 27:35)
you already have a shiny he already had (27:32 - 27:38)
a strategist card you could give it the (27:35 - 27:42)
soup and you just saved yourself $4.99 (27:38 - 27:46)
yeah easy peasy (27:42 - 27:49)
mean okay true talk if I sat down and (27:46 - 27:52)
there were dark clouds swirling around (27:49 - 27:56)
my soup bowl I would not eat that soup (27:52 - 27:58)
well you're just lacking an imagination (27:56 - 28:03)
nothing good dark red clouds that are (27:58 - 28:05)
swirling around your soup you just have (28:03 - 28:08)
to like learn to accept the dark (28:05 - 28:11)
mysteries of the universe and wow them (28:08 - 28:12)
into your soul (28:11 - 28:14)
it also says some Pokemon that trainers (28:12 - 28:16)
are already traveling with may gain the (28:14 - 28:19)
ability he Giganta max I don't know if (28:16 - 28:22)
there's like some other hidden layer and (28:19 - 28:25)
the only reason I say that and maybe I'm (28:22 - 28:27)
taking maybe I'm digging maybe I'm going (28:25 - 28:30)
with my tinfoil hat believe that's a (28:27 - 28:35)
theory tinfoil hat expression oh so so (28:30 - 28:39)
with so if you look at like an item that (28:35 - 28:41)
has exist in the past like gold and (28:39 - 28:42)
bottle caps or just bottle caps in (28:41 - 28:44)
general you do have to get your Pokemon (28:42 - 28:47)
at level 100 and because again this is (28:44 - 28:49)
just a tinfoil hat theory I don't really (28:47 - 28:50)
care if this is true or not I'm not (28:49 - 28:52)
hanging my I'm not hanging my hat on (28:50 - 28:55)
this you know I mean your tinfoil hat on (28:52 - 28:58)
on your conspiracy theory but I wouldn't (28:55 - 29:02)
be surprised if they would require you (28:58 - 29:05)
to have like max friendship with a (29:02 - 29:08)
Pokemon which you would do through curry (29:05 - 29:12)
in order for it to have the max soup (29:08 - 29:16)
because if they're saying like oh we (29:12 - 29:18)
want you to give the soup to your (29:16 - 29:21)
starter if you were just to play the (29:18 - 29:22)
whole game with your starter just by (29:21 - 29:24)
having the starter in your party doing (29:22 - 29:25)
all those battles by the end of that (29:24 - 29:27)
game you could do no cooking and your (29:25 - 29:29)
starter is going to have max friendship (29:27 - 29:33)
value because of the you know twenty to (29:29 - 29:35)
forty hours you put in with your starter (29:33 - 29:37)
from start to finish and we do know that (29:35 - 29:39)
they limit (29:37 - 29:42)
bottle-cap uses by level 100 so if they (29:39 - 29:45)
want to give the trainer a reason to (29:42 - 29:48)
care about friendship hmm instead of (29:45 - 29:50)
just shiny hunting that garb order and (29:48 - 29:52)
then taking it directly and pouring soup (29:50 - 29:55)
down its mouth hey maybe you should you (29:52 - 29:59)
know waggle a little uh feather in front (29:55 - 30:01)
of its face for a couple minutes (29:59 - 30:05)
probably not uh uh maybe maybe night red (30:01 - 30:08)
I read that sentence in a completely (30:05 - 30:11)
different way I read that some pokeman (30:08 - 30:12)
you've already been traveling with may (30:11 - 30:14)
be able to gain the ability to Giganta (30:12 - 30:15)
max hinting that they're releasing more (30:14 - 30:19)
gigantic forms that's exactly what I bet (30:15 - 30:22)
how I heard it it was like I was talking (30:19 - 30:24)
more about the first sentence but Oh (30:22 - 30:27)
which was if a Pokemon with great hidden (30:24 - 30:29)
potential drinks the soup but hmm uh (30:27 - 30:32)
yeah I mean uh but that that makes sense (30:29 - 30:34)
to some Pokemon traveling may also gain (30:32 - 30:36)
the ability to I can't max I would (30:34 - 30:39)
assume like this synesthesia guys I'm (30:36 - 30:46)
sorry give the tea the move scold how (30:39 - 30:50)
did you miss that how is that not a (30:46 - 30:55)
thing I could type a lot of non water (30:50 - 30:57)
types get scold its tea yeah I guess (30:55 - 31:00)
we'll see how hard it is to do this how (30:57 - 31:02)
many ingredients or whatever you need I (31:00 - 31:05)
got two million watts so if they they (31:02 - 31:08)
need somebody if it multiplying some (31:05 - 31:10)
random role from two dudes standing (31:08 - 31:13)
there I got a turbo controller and two (31:10 - 31:16)
million watts are ready to buy I wish I (31:13 - 31:19)
wasn't so low on watts I guess I got to (31:16 - 31:20)
describe to those little blowy dudes (31:19 - 31:25)
yeah I'm at like 700,000 I think I'm at (31:20 - 31:27)
a lot pretty oh sorry we didn't get to (31:25 - 31:28)
the best part I saved the best part for (31:27 - 31:29)
last for the island of armor (31:28 - 31:35)
cram o matic but yeah what is this thing (31:29 - 31:39)
the dojo I'm air the dojo on the island (31:35 - 31:42)
of armor houses a unique take on (31:39 - 31:45)
recycling in the form of a device called (31:42 - 31:48)
the cram o matic if a player feeds at (31:45 - 31:51)
four items it will combine them and give (31:48 - 31:53)
them out in exchange for eight (31:51 - 31:57)
new item hopefully it accepts a witch (31:53 - 31:59)
dreams because I don't need that many (31:57 - 32:03)
slurpuff's anymore this is just like (31:59 - 32:04)
Monster Hunter all over again with the (32:03 - 32:07)
amulets or the talismans yeah remember (32:04 - 32:07)
which one it was (32:07 - 32:09)
and it's like you're just gonna be (32:07 - 32:11)
throwing them in there and getting out (32:09 - 32:12)
whatever random and you know what you're (32:11 - 32:14)
gonna do with that random one combine it (32:12 - 32:15)
with three other things and throw it (32:14 - 32:17)
back in because you got to keep trying (32:15 - 32:19)
till you get the one you want trainers (32:17 - 32:21)
can receive a variety of items including (32:19 - 32:25)
pokeballs peepee ups and more some (32:21 - 32:28)
combinations might even produce rarer (32:25 - 32:30)
items so that's it we don't know what (32:28 - 32:33)
the crime o matic does I think this is (32:30 - 32:36)
where people suggested that it might (32:33 - 32:39)
produce like friend balls or love balls (32:36 - 32:43)
at the point a perk up those balls yes (32:39 - 32:46)
and if it's anything like the champion (32:43 - 32:50)
cup good luck I don't know maybe maybe (32:46 - 32:52)
it'll produce them very easily maybe (32:50 - 32:54)
it's what I don't know I don't even know (32:52 - 32:57)
what what combination would it be like (32:54 - 33:00)
one whip dream 3 luxury balls like what (32:57 - 33:03)
am i throwing in to get the what is Co (33:00 - 33:06)
we will never know I mean it's not until (33:03 - 33:08)
it's out so yes we will know in a week (33:06 - 33:10)
but well it was what's like an (33:08 - 33:13)
incredibly rare like what happens if you (33:10 - 33:14)
throw in a golden bottle cap can you (33:13 - 33:15)
throw in a golden bottle cap that's (33:14 - 33:17)
probably the rarest item right what's (33:15 - 33:20)
rarer than a golden bottle cap master (33:17 - 33:22)
ball there you go you made the master (33:20 - 33:24)
ball morning more master balls I get (33:22 - 33:29)
with my by your eBay Charizard yeah (33:24 - 33:32)
throw for master balls in there and (33:29 - 33:34)
you'll get the ultra shiny master ball (33:32 - 33:36)
the ultra shiny master ball will turn (33:34 - 33:38)
any pokémon you catch with that master (33:36 - 33:41)
ball into an ultra shine top there's (33:38 - 33:42)
probably one six-year-old listening to (33:41 - 33:46)
this thinking that but this is real you (33:42 - 33:46)
heard it here first when it's true but (33:48 - 33:53)
it's true put my name up in lights so (33:50 - 33:55)
excited that crema rant got a lot of (33:53 - 33:57)
love they could have released it like (33:55 - 34:00)
chatot and then forgot about it here's (33:57 - 34:01)
the bigger here's the bigger question (34:00 - 34:05)
are you gonna make a chromatic of your (34:01 - 34:07)
own because it's just (34:05 - 34:10)
a gas can and a rice cooker a vacuum (34:07 - 34:14)
hose like you could do this at home do (34:10 - 34:16)
this on stream make your own Cranmer (34:14 - 34:18)
attic all of these things can be picked (34:16 - 34:20)
up at your local hardware store hardware (34:18 - 34:23)
store salon rice cookers now yeah (34:20 - 34:26)
Ace Hardware would yeah yeah for sure (34:23 - 34:30)
it's not a bad thought process I like (34:26 - 34:34)
I'm giving you content or for read we're (34:30 - 34:35)
getting new backgrounds did you talk (34:34 - 34:38)
about the new backgrounds ah you know (34:35 - 34:39)
wasn't this number what wasn't the press (34:38 - 34:43)
release it's on the website yeah I know (34:39 - 34:44)
they already yeah well they announced (34:43 - 34:47)
that it wasn't like new new (34:44 - 34:50)
oh yeah new new trainer card backgrounds (34:47 - 34:52)
I mean I know they're not gonna do it (34:50 - 34:54)
but I wish the trainer card had more (34:52 - 34:57)
information shown like I wish the (34:54 - 34:59)
trainer card on the back said how many (34:57 - 35:02)
like maybe how many like trainer battles (34:59 - 35:04)
you've done how many times you beaten (35:02 - 35:06)
the champion Cup how many eggs you (35:04 - 35:09)
hatched all the eggs how many raids (35:06 - 35:10)
you've done that would be a really cool (35:09 - 35:15)
statistic but I'm maybe the game doesn't (35:10 - 35:17)
the game keeps track I'm she I'm sure (35:15 - 35:20)
the game keep true I'm sure the Pokemon (35:17 - 35:21)
company knows exactly how many raids are (35:20 - 35:25)
done yes the game the game keeps track (35:21 - 35:27)
let's be honest before we talk about the (35:25 - 35:29)
crown Tundra though and we'll probably (35:27 - 35:32)
take a break before we do that this (35:29 - 35:37)
doesn't seem like a particularly big dlc (35:32 - 35:42)
you have no idea yet from a three minute (35:37 - 35:44)
trailer you can't tell there could be up (35:42 - 35:58)
to seven hours worth from a three minute (35:44 - 36:01)
trailer 90 seconds dedicated to what (35:58 - 36:04)
we're gonna see in a week I have heard (36:01 - 36:06)
other people voice this that you know (36:04 - 36:08)
they're worried that this is going to be (36:06 - 36:11)
pretty what we saw is literally it you (36:08 - 36:13)
know you see the two towers on the beach (36:11 - 36:15)
which is down the street from a dojo (36:13 - 36:19)
which is next to the wild area and that (36:15 - 36:21)
could be it (36:19 - 36:24)
and I don't know what people want out of (36:21 - 36:29)
a DLC that in this case makes their $15 (36:24 - 36:30)
worth it (36:29 - 36:37)
now I can I hate saying like oh it (36:30 - 36:38)
doesn't matter what they give me in the (36:37 - 36:40)
DLC I will get my 15 dollars out of it (36:38 - 36:42)
because it sounds like I'm just this (36:40 - 36:44)
I'll take anything the Pokemon company (36:42 - 36:46)
throws at me and I'll like it kind of (36:44 - 36:50)
prestige right you're a Stooges but the (36:46 - 36:52)
Pokemon company has thrown things at me (36:50 - 36:53)
that I haven't liked in the past like (36:52 - 36:55)
you know when Omega Ruby alpha sapphire (36:53 - 36:57)
came out we barely covered that game (36:55 - 36:58)
because I just wasn't having fun with it (36:57 - 37:01)
at the time Road but the position I'm at (36:58 - 37:06)
now with sword and shield is I have 670 (37:01 - 37:08)
hours in sword and shield (37:06 - 37:11)
I love the heck out of these games so (37:08 - 37:14)
for an extra $15 even if it's (37:11 - 37:17)
disappointing even if everything we read (37:14 - 37:20)
in the last 40 minutes is all that we're (37:17 - 37:23)
getting I think to me that's worth the (37:20 - 37:26)
$15 because I'm still at the end of the (37:23 - 37:30)
day going to be able to get new Pokemon (37:26 - 37:33)
specifically cub foo and a Shifu and and (37:30 - 37:36)
Slowbro well I guess technically I don't (37:33 - 37:37)
have to pay the $15 for that I could (37:36 - 37:39)
theoretically not pay and trade somebody (37:37 - 37:40)
for those mm-hmm (37:39 - 37:44)
and I get the I get the enjoyment of (37:40 - 37:47)
there's a new pokedex there's the island (37:44 - 37:51)
of armor pokedex and I can catch 100 new (37:47 - 37:55)
pokemon in these games and to me that is (37:51 - 37:58)
that is enjoyment I like feeling a (37:55 - 38:00)
pokedex even though I have all of this (37:58 - 38:02)
Pokemon in Pokemon home and I have (38:00 - 38:05)
probably many duplicates of it in it and (38:02 - 38:06)
I could probably just move these Pokemon (38:05 - 38:08)
over and fill the decks instantly and (38:06 - 38:10)
get whatever the reward is if there is a (38:08 - 38:12)
reward for completing the decks I like (38:10 - 38:14)
walking around the aisle wild area (38:12 - 38:16)
catching the Pokemon marking it off my (38:14 - 38:16)
checklist (38:16 - 38:18)
I like filling out checklists I like (38:16 - 38:21)
collecting things oh this is this is (38:18 - 38:23)
well documented in this program yes it (38:21 - 38:27)
is but I am even though I'm going even (38:23 - 38:30)
though like it's 15 bucks for this one (38:27 - 38:32)
and even though it seems lackluster in (38:30 - 38:35)
the press release and in the trailer (38:32 - 38:38)
III hope there's more to it but if (38:35 - 38:41)
there's not I think I can get the $15 (38:38 - 38:44)
out of it because I have probably had (38:41 - 38:46)
worst me I have had where I've (38:44 - 38:49)
definitely had 15 dollars down the drain (38:46 - 38:51)
by ordering something at Five Guys and (38:49 - 38:54)
being extremely disappointed and that (38:51 - 38:57)
experience lasts every trip to five guys (38:54 - 38:58)
that experience lasts like eight minutes (38:57 - 39:01)
of like a burger fries the drink is like (38:58 - 39:03)
sixteen bucks and if that meal sucks (39:01 - 39:06)
that meal sucks but I know for sure (39:03 - 39:08)
catching a hundred pokemon in this game (39:06 - 39:12)
will probably be for me five to six (39:08 - 39:14)
hours and I'm still gonna be I still (39:12 - 39:17)
have old stuff to do and like I still (39:14 - 39:19)
there's still Pokemon I want to hunt (39:17 - 39:20)
there's still marks I want to go hunt (39:19 - 39:21)
there's still things I want to collect (39:20 - 39:25)
and I'm assuming the story in this game (39:21 - 39:27)
is probably gonna be in two hours or (39:25 - 39:30)
three hours maybe yeah so that's that's (39:27 - 39:31)
where I'm coming from with my 15 bucks (39:30 - 39:33)
but I don't know if you guys saw it any (39:31 - 39:35)
different if they don't fix the texture (39:33 - 39:38)
of the trees it'll be wasted and so far (39:35 - 39:40)
in the trailer I don't think that's (39:38 - 39:43)
happened it depends on how large these (39:40 - 39:46)
areas actually feel if I that will (39:43 - 39:50)
determine how I feel if I got my $15 (39:46 - 39:52)
worth like the pictures that they're (39:50 - 39:56)
showing it looks very expansive and like (39:52 - 39:59)
exciting to explore but if it's if in (39:56 - 40:03)
reality it's it it is just very tiny and (39:59 - 40:05)
everything's really compacted then I'm (40:03 - 40:08)
gonna feel like okay this wasn't that (40:05 - 40:13)
great I hope that the storyline with the (40:08 - 40:16)
dojo is interesting and it's not just (40:13 - 40:19)
hey open this up come fight that will (40:16 - 40:22)
give there's just no story at all around (40:19 - 40:25)
mustard or the dojo or why they made (40:22 - 40:28)
this ugly vacuum like if there's just if (40:25 - 40:30)
it's just a bunch of things they wanted (40:28 - 40:32)
to put in the game that aren't well (40:30 - 40:33)
connected then I will be disappointed in (40:32 - 40:35)
it but if it has a good story if it (40:33 - 40:39)
feels great to explore it I'm not that (40:35 - 40:40)
overly thrilled about catching pokémon (40:39 - 40:42)
that I literally do have at home and I (40:40 - 40:45)
can just transfer in it'll still give me (40:42 - 40:47)
something to do but that doesn't hold my (40:45 - 40:49)
attention for very (40:47 - 40:52)
so I'm just hoping that the storyline is (40:49 - 40:54)
good it feels expansive enough that I (40:52 - 40:57)
feel like I'm actually exploring a new (40:54 - 40:59)
part of the world and not just a tiny (40:57 - 41:02)
island that feels tacked on I just feel (40:59 - 41:06)
like Island of armor is going to be very (41:02 - 41:09)
oriented around opening up competitive (41:06 - 41:13)
and battling and giving people more (41:09 - 41:16)
resources to be able to develop you know (41:13 - 41:18)
their Pokemon into competitive ready (41:16 - 41:21)
you know VGC to some level teams and (41:18 - 41:24)
everything and probably won't be so (41:21 - 41:26)
expansive because the amount of work and (41:24 - 41:28)
labor you're going to be putting in is (41:26 - 41:32)
to create competitive pokemon right so (41:28 - 41:36)
less spacious and more like function I (41:32 - 41:38)
don't know how much story they would (41:36 - 41:40)
need to have around I'd like to unlock (41:38 - 41:41)
all of these different areas that are (41:40 - 41:43)
gonna make it so that you can develop (41:41 - 41:46)
more competitive Pokemon and you know (41:43 - 41:47)
like like you you want to think of (41:46 - 41:50)
things like in pieces of you know if (41:47 - 41:53)
they are giving you now the ability to (41:50 - 41:57)
turn any Pokemon into a gigantic max (41:53 - 42:00)
Pokemon versus one that you had to catch (41:57 - 42:03)
in a raid that you know that's like a (42:00 - 42:05)
very clear indication of like do your (42:03 - 42:07)
competitive breeding for the one that (42:05 - 42:09)
you want to be your - again - max (42:07 - 42:11)
Pokemon on your team and then convert it (42:09 - 42:13)
to a gigantic max Pokemon you know after (42:11 - 42:15)
you've done all your breeding and Eevee (42:13 - 42:18)
IV training excitatory cetera and then (42:15 - 42:23)
the frozen whatever that the ice that (42:18 - 42:26)
Tundra is that's gonna be the more (42:23 - 42:30)
expansive open area roam around you know (42:26 - 42:37)
raid find encounter and you know so (42:30 - 42:39)
that's that's my expectation if I see (42:37 - 42:42)
that it'll be enough for me I mean $15 I (42:39 - 42:45)
just spent $12 on the game that I bought (42:42 - 42:49)
you know new content of some level way (42:45 - 42:52)
your bioshock is my Final Fantasy (42:49 - 42:54)
Tactics I have but that game I pretty (42:52 - 42:56)
sure 15 times (42:54 - 43:01)
so weird what no it's like why do we (42:56 - 43:03)
keep buying these we party cuz it's late (43:01 - 43:06)
game and I always think oh I can now (43:03 - 43:07)
play it on my phone (43:06 - 43:11)
heck yeah yeah that's the new experience (43:07 - 43:12)
for me I'll play that game again (43:11 - 43:15)
three bullet points here that aren't new (43:12 - 43:18)
Giganta max pokemon or new pokemon or (43:15 - 43:20)
new legendaries are the tudor moves (43:18 - 43:24)
which is competitive max OOP competitive (43:20 - 43:28)
and cram o matic which it's gonna be (43:24 - 43:30)
enough if it's giving me it says it's (43:28 - 43:32)
gaming pokeballs pp ups and more I mean (43:30 - 43:35)
PP ups is competitive you want to have (43:32 - 43:38)
max PP up so I don't maybe that's why (43:35 - 43:42)
people when people express that oh this (43:38 - 43:45)
DLC looks shallow or this DLC looks very (43:42 - 43:47)
disappointing to what is coming are (43:45 - 43:50)
those people I would be I'd be curious (43:47 - 43:53)
if those those people still expressing (43:50 - 43:55)
expressing like oh I might be (43:53 - 43:57)
disappointed with this are do they not (43:55 - 44:00)
care about competitive because ya know I (43:57 - 44:03)
think that's exactly it right so those (44:00 - 44:06)
people of what it's also sad is that (44:03 - 44:09)
those people may be lost to the (44:06 - 44:11)
subsequent DLC which would be more in (44:09 - 44:13)
their interest I mean it was kind of (44:11 - 44:15)
like the the Zelda DLC the first one (44:13 - 44:17)
people were like oh it's kind of not (44:15 - 44:20)
great but then everyone like loved the (44:17 - 44:22)
second one I hope that doesn't happen (44:20 - 44:25)
here I would like both of them to be (44:22 - 44:28)
great exactly I mean it could be great (44:25 - 44:29)
if you love competitive but if you don't (44:28 - 44:32)
love it that is it then right it feels (44:29 - 44:35)
like person I yeah but that's uh well (44:32 - 44:37)
that's why I'm hoping that they are (44:35 - 44:40)
making competitive easier but also (44:37 - 44:43)
balancing out with some other things for (44:40 - 44:45)
people who don't do competitive like I'm (44:43 - 44:48)
hoping that at least part of their mind (44:45 - 44:51)
was we need to also make this fun and (44:48 - 44:53)
accessible for people who don't want to (44:51 - 44:55)
do competitive right well that's why you (44:53 - 44:56)
have the story that's why you have (44:55 - 44:58)
catching pokémon yeah it's just is that (44:56 - 45:00)
going to be about that that I just hope (44:58 - 45:03)
that the balance is good alright well (45:00 - 45:04)
let's take a break (45:03 - 45:06)
we'll come back we'll go through the (45:04 - 45:08)
crown Tundra there's not as detailed as (45:06 - 45:11)
uh what we just talked about but we will (45:08 - 45:13)
be right back but I thought I'd bring my (45:11 - 45:16)
own culture (45:13 - 45:16)
[Music] (45:19 - 45:26)
[Music] (45:30 - 45:33)
[Music] (45:36 - 45:50)
all right we don't have to spend too (45:51 - 45:55)
much time on this since we have probably (45:53 - 45:58)
five months before it comes up we have (45:55 - 46:00)
plenty of time to circle back to it (45:58 - 46:02)
but the trailer also did show the second (46:00 - 46:04)
area unlocked by the expansion pass is (46:02 - 46:07)
the snow swept realm of the crown tundra (46:04 - 46:10)
in this frigid yet beautiful landscape (46:07 - 46:14)
with its jagged winter mountains and (46:10 - 46:16)
shining silvery (46:14 - 46:19)
landscape people live in a small (46:16 - 46:20)
community where they sport and rely on (46:19 - 46:24)
one another a man named Maxima peony (46:20 - 46:27)
like the flower opa will appoint the (46:24 - 46:30)
player as the leader of his exploration (46:27 - 46:33)
team in the capped crown Tundra and wilt (46:30 - 46:36)
ask them to investigate reaches of this (46:33 - 46:39)
frozen land players will be able to (46:36 - 46:41)
explore the depths of raid dens seen (46:39 - 46:44)
during max raid battles what's more it (46:41 - 46:46)
seems that several previously unseen (46:44 - 46:48)
legendary Pokemon make crown Tundra (46:46 - 46:49)
their home all right (46:48 - 46:53)
confirmation that Articuno Zapdos and (46:49 - 46:57)
Moltres are in gallery' inform I think (46:53 - 47:00)
it was very obvious but technically the (46:57 - 47:01)
Pokemon company didn't say that they (47:00 - 47:03)
were Articuno Moltres and zapped us (47:01 - 47:06)
until now but the legendary Pokemon (47:03 - 47:08)
bearing there's a strong resemblance to (47:06 - 47:10)
Articuno Zapdos and Moltres have been (47:08 - 47:12)
spotted in the crown Tundra these (47:10 - 47:14)
Pokemon seemed to bear ice-type (47:12 - 47:16)
electric-type and fire type (47:14 - 47:19)
characteristics respectively and thought (47:16 - 47:21)
to be the same Articuno Zapdos small (47:19 - 47:23)
trace seen in other regions recent (47:21 - 47:26)
gathered data reported sightings and (47:23 - 47:28)
other sources about these pokemon have (47:26 - 47:32)
bolstered they are in fact distant (47:28 - 47:37)
distinct variants so we have Galera and (47:32 - 47:39)
Articuno which is known as the cruel (47:37 - 47:43)
Pokemon it is psychic flying with the (47:39 - 47:46)
ability competitive (47:43 - 47:49)
wait no more ice no more ice I (47:46 - 47:53)
I love the V for Vendetta look I already (47:49 - 47:56)
loved Articuno and this one just hits me (47:53 - 48:00)
where I live it's so good I mean we all (47:56 - 48:02)
agree that out of the birds Articuno is (48:00 - 48:05)
the best bird absolutely yes put out in (48:02 - 48:08)
this trio what chocobo go with the (48:05 - 48:13)
country Zapdos will will we'll check (48:08 - 48:15)
back in after we get through how great (48:13 - 48:17)
Articuno is here I also think that these (48:15 - 48:19)
are literally designed for competitive (48:17 - 48:20)
based off their abilities and their (48:19 - 48:23)
Taipings and whatever these are (48:20 - 48:25)
definitely gonna be VDC once every (48:23 - 48:28)
several decades this pokemon appears in (48:25 - 48:30)
the crown Tundra gallery and Articuno (48:28 - 48:33)
signature move move freezing glare is a (48:30 - 48:35)
psychic-type move in which a Pokemon (48:33 - 48:37)
attacks by firing psychic powers from (48:35 - 48:40)
both eyes this may result in leaving the (48:37 - 48:44)
target frozen so wild I love it (48:40 - 48:46)
gallery' and Zapdos which is the strong (48:44 - 48:50)
leg Pokemon it is fighting flying it has (48:46 - 48:54)
the ability defiant once every several (48:50 - 48:56)
decades this Pokemon appears in the (48:54 - 48:59)
crown Tundra gallery' and Zapdos is (48:56 - 49:01)

there I understand that when they named (51:35 - 51:41)
these Pokemon a specifically legendary (51:39 - 51:43)
Pokemon they named them with the the (51:41 - 51:45)
thought process of they're gonna be (51:43 - 51:48)
similar in every language and for the (51:45 - 51:52)
most part that's true - like the the (51:48 - 51:55)
tapas and - Articuno Moltres Aptos it (51:52 - 51:58)
just seems like a very hard name to say (51:55 - 52:01)
like it doesn't roll off the tongue it (51:58 - 52:04)
Ella key it's as easy to say as Mele (52:01 - 52:09)
Kalikimaka I don't know what may be (52:04 - 52:11)
wrong maybe other language is very easy (52:09 - 52:13)
to say its signature (52:11 - 52:16)
electric-type move thunder cage fires (52:13 - 52:18)
furious bolts of electricity from its (52:16 - 52:21)
lower half trapping opponents directly (52:18 - 52:24)
below its cage of lightning thunder cage (52:21 - 52:27)
doesn't only deal damage the electrified (52:24 - 52:30)
cage will also cause damage every turn (52:27 - 52:33)
for four to five turns to prevent the (52:30 - 52:34)
opponent from fleeing or swapping out (52:33 - 52:36)
it's literally fire spin that's all it (52:34 - 52:39)
is or whirlpool it's electric world (52:36 - 52:40)
pearl fire spin I'm getting tired of (52:39 - 52:46)
these multi turn got one trick here in (52:40 - 52:49)
sword and shield and that's it (52:46 - 52:51)

transistor and then the other one is (52:56 - 53:00)
Reggie Drago (52:59 - 53:03)
the dragon orbit pokemon it's a (53:00 - 53:06)
dragon-type 611 440 pounds with the (53:03 - 53:10)
ability dragons ma reggie Drago's body (53:06 - 53:13)
composed of crystallized dragon energy (53:10 - 53:16)
when Reggie Drago's signature move Drago (53:13 - 53:19)
dragon energy the Pokemon assumes the (53:16 - 53:22)
similar shape of a dragon head and the (53:19 - 53:25)
fires the fire then fires intense (53:22 - 53:29)
dragons energy from its mouth then fires (53:25 - 53:32)
they ever printed a dragon's energy you (53:29 - 53:37)
know the more HP the user has remaining (53:32 - 53:40)

similar to like overheat or waterspout (53:40 - 53:46)

bunch of people in that uniform so it's (55:09 - 55:12)
probably one of them there's a lot more (55:11 - 55:13)
bullet points here for the crown Tundra (55:12 - 55:15)

until it falls out try to find a good (57:49 - 57:54)
picture of uh this dude but he has like (57:51 - 57:58)
uh he has a creature on his hat which I (57:54 - 58:01)
mean couldn't mean nothing but also Eric (57:58 - 58:04)
Udo was shown in crime rants mouth and (58:01 - 58:07)
not announced as a Pokemon at all and it (58:04 - 58:08)
just appeared in the game I mean it was (58:07 - 58:11)
like leaked but they didn't like mu we (58:08 - 58:14)
knew we knew that deep down Kramer aunt (58:11 - 58:18)
knew what was up this is an audio (58:14 - 58:19)
podcast if you want to go through the (58:18 - 58:21)
trailer and look at the dudes hat you (58:19 - 58:23)
can see like a little orange worm thing (58:21 - 58:25)
on his on his hat it could be nothing (58:23 - 58:28)
but I feel like they probably wouldn't (58:25 - 58:29)
have made a character they would (58:28 - 58:32)
probably just put like a word or a (58:29 - 58:36)
letter or a symbol and not a creature (58:32 - 58:38)
and (58:36 - 58:40)
game about collecting creatures maybe (58:38 - 58:42)
not I'm trying to stop it to see (58:40 - 58:45)
people's seem real more excited about (58:42 - 58:48)
real more excited that's a sentence they (58:45 - 58:51)
seem real more excited about the crown (58:48 - 58:53)
Tundra and I don't again this is the (58:51 - 58:55)
comparison of the two if we're assuming (58:53 - 58:56)
that the island of armor is very (58:55 - 58:59)
competitive focus and maybe most of the (58:56 - 59:01)
people being vocal about this on on (58:59 - 59:04)
social media just don't care about (59:01 - 59:06)
battling as much as they'd like to (59:04 - 59:09)
besides having just a ton of legendary (59:06 - 59:11)
Pokemon to catch in max raid battles and (59:09 - 59:13)
besides co-op that leads to max rate (59:11 - 59:16)
battles and besides going through the (59:13 - 59:19)
champion Cup again through co-op that's (59:16 - 59:21)
all that the second DLC seems to be (59:19 - 59:25)
offering which is co-op and which is max (59:21 - 59:28)
right battles well and just like you get (59:25 - 59:33)
a new wild area to explore yeah I get to (59:28 - 59:34)
get all the legends that you've missed (59:33 - 59:39)
again again well you missed them before (59:34 - 59:41)
you see yeah I don't know it doesn't (59:39 - 59:43)
seem like the second one is bigger it (59:41 - 59:45)
just seems like the second one has a (59:43 - 59:46)
different focus and it just seems like (59:45 - 59:48)
people like that focus more people like (59:46 - 59:51)
catching Legendary's I think more than (59:48 - 59:53)
they like going through a battle tower I (59:51 - 59:56)
agree with this completely I believe I (59:53 - 59:57)
used to watch a twitch streamer who (59:56 - 59:59)
would go through wormholes rather than (59:57 - 60:03)
doing any kind of battle thing I like (59:59 - 60:05)
wormholes we got plenty of time to talk (60:03 - 60:09)
about the crown Tundra more in-depth yes (60:05 - 60:13)
this is also off Pokemon calm battle (60:09 - 60:15)

and amorous Lamora that you more no more (60:54 - 61:00)
I don't know how to say its name it (60:58 - 61:02)
depends on how you it could be a (61:00 - 61:06)
stylized letter P it could be a P but (61:02 - 61:08)
they leave it in eyes it's cool Aryan (61:06 - 61:13)
Tropius it's just that they put a lot of (61:08 - 61:16)
effort into his hat and they did that (61:13 - 61:19)
looks like a Pokemon they did yeah I (61:16 - 61:21)
mean there's a lot of effort in that (61:19 - 61:24)
design for it not to be probably a glare (61:21 - 61:26)
and form of something like I could see (61:24 - 61:30)
an ice type Tropius or you know because (61:26 - 61:32)
we're in a genre like as it goes with an (61:30 - 61:34)
an ice or here's the order P with an i (61:32 - 61:38)
or could just bar could be PEO X pucks (61:34 - 61:42)
so P any say oh you know I mean they (61:38 - 61:43)
never put anything on this hat but they (61:42 - 61:45)
did they didn't have to put in an attack (61:43 - 61:48)

2020 exclusively at Target stores and (65:59 - 66:09)
online at target.com yeah I go to my (66:04 - 66:12)
board game retailer it looks like a (66:09 - 66:15)
three decks are a Charizard deck a (66:12 - 66:19)
Mewtwo deck and a Pikachu deck that (66:15 - 66:20)
sounds about right (66:19 - 66:22)
yeah this is those sound like few fear (66:20 - 66:29)
and pokemon that every mother knows why (66:22 - 66:33)
does chars rgx have 250 HP hey we're (66:29 - 66:37)
pushing 330 HP in the actual TCG but the (66:33 - 66:40)
right shoe GX has 210 and the mu2 GX has (66:37 - 66:44)
180 and those two also do a lot less (66:40 - 66:47)
damage why would you play in why would (66:44 - 66:49)
you not always play Charizard because (66:47 - 66:52)
the carries rgx just 300 damn it might (66:49 - 66:55)
be other cards in there cuz welcome you (66:52 - 66:57)
to is a basic pokémon Charizard and you (66:55 - 66:59)
know as a level to let stage two you got (66:57 - 67:01)
a Wookiee you gotta get two stars are (66:59 - 67:02)
probably not I'm sure they're all (67:01 - 67:04)
probably Basic Pokemon well it says (67:02 - 67:07)
right you GX is a stage one (67:04 - 67:10)
Charizard GX is staged okay yeah a GX is (67:07 - 67:14)
bass usually why a stage two usually has (67:10 - 67:16)
dramatically more HP and more attack (67:14 - 67:17)
because it takes effort (67:16 - 67:21)
get there yeah um like cuz rare candies (67:17 - 67:24)
out right yeah there you go you have to (67:21 - 67:26)
go through the full stages of evolution (67:24 - 67:28)
to get there which the other ones don't (67:26 - 67:30)
have to do gotcha (67:28 - 67:33)
but like does the damage like does the (67:30 - 67:34)
fact that me to GX has the basic polka (67:33 - 67:38)
whens GX do 120 damage and it's (67:34 - 67:42)
regularly does 110 is that like still (67:38 - 67:46)
part of the bloat or 180 for a basic (67:42 - 67:50)
work 1 180 HP its main attacked as 110 (67:46 - 67:52)
and it's GX attacked as 120 that makes (67:50 - 67:55)
sense I mean that's kind of where all G (67:52 - 67:57)
axes are at at this point so that seemed (67:55 - 68:00)
um par 4 to psychic energy and a (67:57 - 68:01)
colorless we talked about the new (68:00 - 68:03)
Giganta BEC so we talked about the (68:01 - 68:05)
hidden ability Pokemon we talked about (68:03 - 68:08)
the board game that leads us with this (68:05 - 68:11)
last bit of news here 2 parts though (68:08 - 68:14)
first part is off Shaq news there was (68:11 - 68:15)
actually not a lot of people that (68:14 - 68:17)
covered this although if you follow (68:15 - 68:19)
Pokemon Twitter you probably saw the (68:17 - 68:25)
Pokemon company donates $200,000 to (68:19 - 68:28)
combat social injustice --is injustice (68:25 - 68:31)
is I think I said that wrong the first (68:28 - 68:34)
time the Pokemon company the corporation (68:31 - 68:36)
behind one of the world's most popular (68:34 - 68:38)
and most recognized old franchises and (68:36 - 68:40)
pop culture has stepped forward to give (68:38 - 68:43)
their stance on the systemic racism (68:40 - 68:45)
presented in America following the (68:43 - 68:48)
murder of George Floyd in May of 2020 (68:45 - 68:50)
protests have been taking place around (68:48 - 68:52)
the world the social backlash has has (68:50 - 68:54)
caused numerous companies and (68:52 - 68:55)
corporations to speak out and even (68:54 - 68:58)
donate money the Pokemon company has (68:55 - 69:01)
voiced their support of the black lives (68:58 - 69:03)
matter movement and pledged to donate to (69:01 - 69:05)
the cause the Pokemon company took their (69:03 - 69:07)
official Twitter to share the statement (69:05 - 69:10)
quote we stand in solidarity with our (69:07 - 69:12)
black employees fans and families who (69:10 - 69:16)
continue to be impacted by racism and (69:12 - 69:18)
senseless violence the company said in (69:16 - 69:20)
its post this reflects the sentiment (69:18 - 69:22)
shared by many others around the (69:20 - 69:24)
industry Nintendo a co publisher of the (69:22 - 69:25)
Pokemon franchise made a similar (69:24 - 69:28)
statement not only did the Pokemon (69:25 - 69:29)
company confirm their stance on the (69:28 - 69:31)
ongoing crisis and now (69:29 - 69:35)
to donate towards the support Pokemon (69:31 - 69:39)
has donated $100,000 to n N double ACP (69:35 - 69:42)
and another $100,000 to black lives (69:39 - 69:44)
matter it's always reassuring to see (69:42 - 69:46)
major companies not only plant their (69:44 - 69:49)
flag on a somewhat controversial issue I (69:46 - 69:51)
don't think there's any controversy (69:49 - 69:54)
about not liking getting rid of racism (69:51 - 69:56)
but okay but use their money and (69:54 - 70:00)
platform to back these stances EA also (69:56 - 70:01)
announced a million-dollar donation as (70:00 - 70:05)
long and up matching employee donations (70:01 - 70:08)
by 200 percent I get those buzzwords in (70:05 - 70:11)
there I gotta get that EA yeah now buzz (70:08 - 70:14)
words click click throughs so that's I (70:11 - 70:18)
think one it made my day to see one of (70:14 - 70:20)
my favorite companies support a good (70:18 - 70:25)
cause but also I think the impressive (70:20 - 70:28)
thing here is that we all know or if (70:25 - 70:29)
you've been listening to this podcast (70:28 - 70:32)
and we've known various people to work (70:29 - 70:34)
with the Pokemon company to work at the (70:32 - 70:37)
Pokemon company to work around the (70:34 - 70:40)
Pokemon company they are very very slow (70:37 - 70:45)
on things and yes yeah and in order to (70:40 - 70:48)
get anything approved say whether it's (70:45 - 70:51)
the UK office or the the Washington (70:48 - 70:53)
office everything still has to go (70:51 - 70:58)
through Japan and so the the protests (70:53 - 71:01)
and all that stuff kind of really hit (70:58 - 71:05)
the news mainstream they're like (71:01 - 71:08)
twenty-ninth yeah bring that xxx right (71:05 - 71:11)
around there's when everybody was (71:08 - 71:12)
talking about it they made this (71:11 - 71:16)
announcement on the third I believe yep (71:12 - 71:20)
somehow to the team at the Pokemon (71:16 - 71:23)
company they were able to get that (71:20 - 71:26)
message to Japan get it approved and (71:23 - 71:30)
come back and posted in what is probably (71:26 - 71:33)
record time there's not a time for them (71:30 - 71:35)
absolutely them (71:33 - 71:39)
absolutely there's not there's maybe a (71:35 - 71:40)
small chance that they didn't need (71:39 - 71:42)
Japan's approval but I don't I think (71:40 - 71:46)
they needed a yeah for $200,000 yeah (71:42 - 71:48)
yeah they needed Japan some purple and (71:46 - 71:50)
they needed Japan's lawyers to sign off (71:48 - 71:52)
on as well as all the American lawyers (71:50 - 71:54)
like there's so many layers corporations (71:52 - 71:56)
have to go through to get a message out (71:54 - 71:57)
so that's awesome (71:56 - 72:02)
let's but not a lot of uh not a lot of (71:57 - 72:04)
new sites pick that up I don't know if (72:02 - 72:07)
they need to I mean like I think most (72:04 - 72:12)
most companies are yeah oh yeah this is (72:07 - 72:14)
a needle in a haystack at this point in (72:12 - 72:17)
time yes I just don't think like new (72:14 - 72:20)
news outlets are looking at Pokemon as (72:17 - 72:24)
as the scoop to get I think they're (72:20 - 72:25)
looking at all the really bigger (72:24 - 72:29)
companies that hit many many many people (72:25 - 72:32)
like it well I just great I think I (72:29 - 72:35)
think this guy passed up because of (72:32 - 72:37)
Pokemon go was donation (72:35 - 72:39)
yeah knee antic and that's that's that's (72:37 - 72:41)
what the new sites use they use the word (72:39 - 72:44)
Pokemon go will donate because that is (72:41 - 72:46)
that's the click-through you want right (72:44 - 72:48)
yeah it's just like completely ignoring (72:46 - 72:55)
the harry potter wizards unite i pulled (72:48 - 72:57)
this from hypebeast comp Okavango will (72:55 - 73:02)
donate 5 million USD minimum from go (72:57 - 73:05)
fest ticket sales and the company will (73:02 - 73:09)
match employee donations to the Marsha P (73:05 - 73:12)
Johnson Institute yeah so this is (73:09 - 73:15)
actually Nene antic donating the money (73:12 - 73:18)
yeah I mean I'm on their press release I (73:15 - 73:21)
think it's something quite remarkable (73:18 - 73:24)
that knee antic didn't do the trevor (73:21 - 73:26)
project i mean they're their blood (73:24 - 73:29)
owning a hundred a hundred thousand to (73:26 - 73:31)
the Marsha P Johnson Institute which (73:29 - 73:35)
never gets love like I I peeps you don't (73:31 - 73:37)
talk about it but like black trans (73:35 - 73:40)
people like if you want to talk about (73:37 - 73:43)
every card stacked against you and (73:40 - 73:45)
nobody paying attention to your needs (73:43 - 73:48)
like the fact that (73:45 - 73:50)
have called that out in the giant press (73:48 - 73:54)
release like makes me appreciate the (73:50 - 73:57)
people that work at the antics so much (73:54 - 74:01)
to pick such a vital charity in addition (73:57 - 74:03)
to what they're already doing their (74:01 - 74:07)
press releases very long mm-hmm which (74:03 - 74:09)
they also didn't need to do and it's (74:07 - 74:11)
it's a very good press release we won't (74:09 - 74:13)
go through the whole thing the statement (74:11 - 74:14)
that hypebeast pulled which I will read (74:13 - 74:16)
here is the work to follow through (74:14 - 74:20)
require years of effort to yield the (74:16 - 74:22)
impact we seek the hearts of Niantic is (74:20 - 74:25)
our community of players is imperative (74:22 - 74:26)
that we stand up to support black (74:25 - 74:29)
trainers agents and wizards we aim to be (74:26 - 74:31)
a force of change committed to the long (74:29 - 74:34)
road ahead of rebuilding a more just and (74:31 - 74:36)
fair system where all are welcomed (74:34 - 74:39)
valued and have a fair chance of success (74:36 - 74:41)
and then that says we will we will be (74:39 - 74:43)
donating the antics proceeds from (74:41 - 74:45)
Pokemon go Fest ticket sales committing (74:43 - 74:48)
a minimum of five million dollars USD (74:45 - 74:51)
Yantic head knee antics head John Hanke (74:48 - 74:53)
wrote in a statement post on Twitter (74:51 - 74:55)
half of the proceeds donated will be (74:53 - 74:59)
used to fund new projects projects form (74:55 - 75:02)
from black gaming and AR creators that (74:59 - 75:04)
can live on the antics platform with the (75:02 - 75:07)
ultimate goal of increasing content that (75:04 - 75:09)
represents a more diverse view on the (75:07 - 75:11)
world the statement continues the other (75:09 - 75:13)
half will go to a US nonprofit (75:11 - 75:14)
organizations that are helping (75:13 - 75:17)
communities rebuild Hinke stated the (75:14 - 75:19)
company will also commit several to (75:17 - 75:21)
several employee efforts including (75:19 - 75:23)
apprenticeships leading to permanent (75:21 - 75:25)
positions Allied training scholarship (75:23 - 75:28)
support and employee volunteer days and (75:25 - 75:31)
then uh Greg brought up the Marsha Pete (75:28 - 75:35)
Johnson Pokemon go Fest 2020 will be (75:31 - 75:38)
conducted as a virtual event in July due (75:35 - 75:41)
to Cova 19 which is still a thing as (75:38 - 75:43)
opposed to the usual in-person meetups (75:41 - 75:45)
that attract thousands of players (75:43 - 75:47)
hypebeast does mention this is not the (75:45 - 75:49)
first donation from the antic they are (75:47 - 75:51)
known for matching donations of fans (75:49 - 75:54)
contributing to support the stem project (75:51 - 75:57)
I'm not sure when that when that was but (75:54 - 76:00)
yeah that's a lot of money yeah (75:57 - 76:03)
I don't know if five million people are (76:00 - 76:07)
going to buy go fest tickets but I also (76:03 - 76:10)
don't expect go fest tickets to be $1 I (76:07 - 76:12)
think five million people since it's a (76:10 - 76:15)
stay at home go fest will buy yeah its (76:12 - 76:18)
worldwide and yeah I mean you're right (76:15 - 76:21)
it's gonna be minimum ten dollars yeah I (76:18 - 76:23)
mean it's ten dollars probably right (76:21 - 76:26)
because the the time research one is (76:23 - 76:29)
$7.99 and I'm already mad at that even (76:26 - 76:31)
though I got it for free how am I (76:29 - 76:34)
supposed to do 15 rates and hash fifteen (76:31 - 76:36)
eggs it's do one right today we're gonna (76:34 - 76:42)
go like to the park again okay okay good (76:36 - 76:43)
on them but yeah the only other thing I (76:42 - 76:45)
would say is I appreciate that they said (76:43 - 76:49)
apprenticeships since internships is you (76:45 - 76:51)
know actually becomes a racial issue so (76:49 - 76:53)
yeah that's like apprenticeships that (76:51 - 76:56)
turn into jobs that's a great thing I (76:53 - 77:02)
believe uh Square Enix donated $250,000 (76:56 - 77:05)
I think Lego donated like four million (77:02 - 77:10)
Lego like has so many amazing things (77:05 - 77:13)
I did not expect Lego to do I you know I (77:10 - 77:15)
don't I'm sure there are other big (77:13 - 77:17)
gaming companies that I'm not following (77:15 - 77:21)
that have donated money occasions yes (77:17 - 77:27)
and even there are a ton of us (77:21 - 77:31)
independent game makers who are are (77:27 - 77:34)
donating our time and money though (77:31 - 77:36)
there's a lot out there if you do want (77:34 - 77:38)
to take a look and again if you're (77:36 - 77:40)
looking to donate and you don't know (77:38 - 77:41)
where to go (77:40 - 77:44)
even if it's like five bucks our our (77:41 - 77:47)
charity Color of Change that we have (77:44 - 77:50)
donated to ends on Friday and that's in (77:47 - 77:52)
the show notes so thank you to everyone (77:50 - 77:55)

wrong one and all of a sudden you've got (80:07 - 80:11)
like right outside the window of your (80:09 - 80:14)
fifth floor apartment you know a Morris (80:11 - 80:20)
or something I don't know it's like I (80:14 - 80:22)
mean we all know Will Anderson doesn't (80:20 - 80:24)
like stuffed animals (80:22 - 80:28)
so that's an issue but I do use stuffed (80:24 - 80:30)
animals to decorate my bed after I've (80:28 - 80:31)
made my bed (80:30 - 80:33)
what would kind of fit right into that (80:31 - 80:37)
nish lifes life-size but still like you (80:33 - 80:39)
could put it on your bed as a decoration (80:37 - 80:43)
I already have a flabébé that does that (80:39 - 80:48)
hmm Greg give me some advice I mean what (80:43 - 80:51)
about a life-sized for Bambi would be (80:48 - 80:55)
real yeah well that may be not the (80:51 - 80:59)
Rabanne be it would still be tiny let me (80:55 - 81:04)
see what the stats are for Rev on B to C (80:59 - 81:04)
nope real small how small is real small (81:05 - 81:15)
8 inches I think oh not that yeah 8 (81:11 - 81:19)
inches height is 8 inches but it's one (81:15 - 81:25)
pound yeah oh it's tiny I mean 8 inches (81:19 - 81:30)
is not is his decoration for my guess (81:25 - 81:35)
what about Sylvia how big is Sylvia yeah (81:30 - 81:38)
but I mean having a stuff sylveon it's (81:35 - 81:41)
got the Ritz (81:38 - 81:45)
yeah what about that stuff Glacia that's (81:41 - 81:48)
too cold but my part Leafeon (81:45 - 81:55)
that's too ugly stuff tvs we got it we (81:48 - 81:57)
got to get out of the the realm of (81:55 - 81:59)
things that people have already (81:57 - 82:03)
experienced how about for drew hawlucha (81:59 - 82:08)
for Andrew uh yes feet tall but I think (82:03 - 82:11)
that's that would be quite I agree I (82:08 - 82:13)
that I would select that for them (82:11 - 82:18)
mmm-hmm for William oh here can we (82:13 - 82:22)
a rock rough I mean it's chunky housing (82:18 - 82:26)
it'll keep humming is Volcarona true I (82:22 - 82:29)
think it's actually quite large (82:26 - 82:34)
it's five feet tall I love I will take a (82:29 - 82:39)
five foot tall Volcarona yes Steve Cram (82:34 - 82:44)
ran yeah that was life-size know that (82:39 - 82:47)
life-size oh I don't know how Brant I (82:44 - 82:51)
mean isn't he like two feet tall or rant (82:47 - 82:55)
this is two feet tall you feet 12 inches (82:51 - 82:59)
39 pounds with now would you want it (82:55 - 83:02)
would you want your life size to have a (82:59 - 83:06)
mouth that you can open to shove other (83:02 - 83:08)
pushes into oh yeah that would be so (83:06 - 83:14)
cool and you store all your pushes in (83:08 - 83:15)
its belly and then you squeeze it and (83:14 - 83:19)
they come up then I got all the ideas (83:15 - 83:22)
Pokemon company the DLC could give us a (83:19 - 83:24)
chance of cram rent having its own (83:22 - 83:27)
Giganta max form car you won't could (83:24 - 83:30)
probably not uh what's her Pokemon of (83:27 - 83:32)
the week all right well the previous (83:30 - 83:34)
Pokemon of the week was summed up in one (83:32 - 83:36)
sentence and I will read that sentence (83:34 - 83:40)
back to you again my pokey date who (83:36 - 83:43)
we're off to a bad start (83:40 - 83:43)
my pokedex indicates that on July 22nd (83:44 - 83:50)
2017 I was walking down south Michigan (83:48 - 83:53)
Avenue to meet up with SBJ at burger bar (83:50 - 83:55)
Chicago where the air conditioning was (83:53 - 83:58)
not working for a local fan event when I (83:55 - 83:59)
was told that this psychic flying-type (83:58 - 84:02)
quasi bird had been spotted above (83:59 - 84:04)
Buckingham Fountain which seemed (84:02 - 84:06)
appropriate as it is known as the Lord (84:04 - 84:21)
of the Seas Steve did say at the end of (84:06 - 84:23)
last week that he knew it already it's (84:21 - 84:24)
true (84:23 - 84:27)
and he was also there (84:24 - 84:27)
supposedly nothing the world doesn't (84:34 - 84:38)
work anymore (84:37 - 84:42)
well new times new days okay here I'll (84:38 - 84:42)
do (84:42 - 84:51)
it's Joan Jett no stop that's so mean (84:42 - 84:51)
look 80s rocker ladies you know I was (84:52 - 85:00)
young I get it I get it (84:58 - 85:04)
what's our what's our trivia lugia was (85:00 - 85:07)
actually uh created for the movie not (85:04 - 85:10)
for the games and yet it was in the (85:07 - 85:11)
games yes (85:10 - 85:14)
so lugia was created by takahashi shuto (85:11 - 85:17)
for the second movie he was surprised to (85:14 - 85:19)
learn that lugia was then used in the (85:17 - 85:23)
games and put in the anime why would you (85:19 - 85:24)
not and there was a baby lugia in the (85:23 - 85:27)
anime - why would you why would you have (85:24 - 85:28)
Pokemon that you couldn't have in the (85:27 - 85:30)
games that just seems so (85:28 - 85:35)
counterproductive what because it well I (85:30 - 85:36)
don't know it goes to the whole there's (85:35 - 85:39)
like a bunch of Pokemon fans and their (85:36 - 85:42)
mental gymnastics of how like the games (85:39 - 85:44)
are like the most important part of the (85:42 - 85:47)
series when in reality Pokemon would (85:44 - 85:49)
long survive never releasing another (85:47 - 85:55)
game again well yeah just like the the (85:49 - 86:00)
anime unveiled the togepi first and for (85:55 - 86:02)
the people who need help picking apart (86:00 - 86:06)
the clue July 22nd 2017 was the first (86:02 - 86:10)
Pokemon go fast and they released lugia (86:06 - 86:13)
after the go fest was after the disaster (86:10 - 86:15)
yes I think well I think lugia was (86:13 - 86:17)
always supposed to be released that day (86:15 - 86:21)
yes and it is Lord of the Seas because (86:17 - 86:25)
ho-oh is Lord of the skies which makes (86:21 - 86:27)
no sense because lujah is not (86:25 - 86:31)
water-type but in the beginning of no I (86:27 - 86:33)
know that her son noted that he's (86:31 - 86:35)
swimming underwater (86:33 - 86:39)
it doesn't still (86:35 - 86:42)
see still doesn't have school so yeah (86:39 - 86:44)
brick chaos and disorder everywhere you (86:42 - 86:48)
look before he's fix it before the (86:44 - 86:50)
introduction of gold and silver lugia (86:48 - 86:55)
was known as Pokemon X baron era and the (86:50 - 86:58)
it in the anime dr. Namba yes everyone (86:55 - 87:01)
remembers dr. Nam huh from the anime you (86:58 - 87:04)
don't also refers to loogie as Pokemon X (87:01 - 87:07)
perhaps coincidentally it is known as (87:04 - 87:11)
code name XD zero zero one in XD Gale of (87:07 - 87:16)
Darkness an amazing game hmm interesting (87:11 - 87:19)
in gold and silver lugia like hoo has (87:16 - 87:21)
the same encounter music as a normal (87:19 - 87:26)
wild Pokemon ripoff that was true with (87:21 - 87:28)
the legendary Pokemon raikou ante and (87:26 - 87:30)
suicune before they received unique (87:28 - 87:33)
music in crystal however lugia and ho-oh (87:30 - 87:35)
got their own unique music in hark old (87:33 - 87:37)
soul silver despite not being a (87:35 - 87:40)
water-type lugia is usually depicted as (87:37 - 87:42)
a water type in the Pokemon Trading Card (87:40 - 87:43)
Game (87:42 - 87:47)
oh that's true loogie has a shiny form (87:43 - 87:49)
shown in pokemon stadium 2 is green (87:47 - 87:54)
rather than pink I like lugia yeah I (87:49 - 87:57)
liked lugia more as a kid than hoo and (87:54 - 88:00)
now I realized that I was wrong as a kid (87:57 - 88:03)
and hoo is significantly better I (88:00 - 88:06)
explained what idea is that it looks (88:03 - 88:09)
real weird but the shuffle icons real (88:06 - 88:12)
great why okay why okay back up (88:09 - 88:15)
why were you wrong why is her Oh better (88:12 - 88:17)
cuz for who could make rainbows what can (88:15 - 88:22)
lugia do nothing control the sea Wow (88:17 - 88:24)
now if I need if I need it straight over (88:22 - 88:26)
rainbow I needed something crawl to see (88:24 - 88:29)
I'll call my boy Kyogre he makes things (88:26 - 88:32)
rain yeah I'm alright with that look I'm (88:29 - 88:35)
already in the sea I'm already wet I (88:32 - 88:35)
mean you're not wrong check I say you're (88:35 - 88:40)
right either (88:39 - 88:44)
[Laughter] (88:40 - 88:47)
you like lujah more than oh it's gen - I (88:44 - 88:50)
don't like ya I think it's pretty much (88:47 - 88:52)
equal for both of them (88:50 - 88:56)
I'll okay I will say this I like a shiny (88:52 - 89:00)
form better have a good shining it's got (88:56 - 89:03)
a good shiny it's got a terrible shuffle (89:00 - 89:06)
icon though but it's got a real good (89:03 - 89:09)
shiny hushpuppy dia showed a picture of (89:06 - 89:12)
what it looks like in stadium I kind of (89:09 - 89:14)

don't know yeah (91:47 - 91:52)
midnight in your region or midnight P (91:49 - 91:55)
yes I think when I was asking my twitch (91:52 - 91:58)
chat they were saying for smash it just (91:55 - 92:00)
unlocked for everyone at the same time (91:58 - 92:04)
and it was like p.m. at night or (92:00 - 92:09)
something for us so I yeah I don't 100% (92:04 - 92:13)

p.m. for all of the us I I don't know (92:13 - 92:20)

comes out on the 17th and I normally (92:24 - 92:31)
start my new game streams at noon I know (92:27 - 92:34)
a lot of people will stream or start (92:31 - 92:36)
playing at midnight which is cool but I (92:34 - 92:39)
like that if people want to watch me on (92:36 - 92:42)
Twitch I like that they're already ahead (92:39 - 92:44)
of me so then they feel comfortable (92:42 - 92:46)
watching they don't worry about spoilers (92:44 - 92:48)
you're playing at midnight that's (92:46 - 92:49)
awesome because then when you come in a (92:48 - 92:52)
stream you'll probably be ahead of me (92:49 - 92:54)

million things but that's all I got (92:54 - 92:59)
