heavy episode since Pokemon go added a (1:16 - 1:23)
brand new feature uh well pre pregaming (1:19 - 1:27)
a brand new feature I guess yeah it&#39;s a (1:23 - 1:28)
good way putting it (1:27 - 1:31)
yeah uh before before we get to the (1:28 - 1:33)
Pokémon Go stuff we (1:31 - 1:35)

sleep news this is suun week so we&#39;ll (1:49 - 1:54)
start off with the Pokemon sleep stuff (1:52 - 1:58)
uh how how was everyone&#39;s first suun (1:54 - 2:01)
week did you get your suun (1:58 - 2:04)
yes I sure did I sure did I&#39;m so mad (2:01 - 2:06)
though you two will laugh at this I (2:04 - 2:08)
mathed out the first one and I was one (2:06 - 2:11)
heart short before it got full off of my (2:08 - 2:14)
first incense I was like oh my gosh who (2:11 - 2:15)
can I tell that would care about this (2:14 - 2:17)
and I was like here here&#39;s my (2:15 - 2:19)
opportunity yeah no but uh I I ran it I (2:17 - 2:21)
ran it back got a second incense and (2:19 - 2:24)
then you know one one Pok ball (2:21 - 2:27)
biscuit perfect perfect oh my gosh yeah (2:24 - 2:29)
but I got him happy happy to say I got (2:27 - 2:32)
my my beautiful suun we&#39;re happy nice (2:29 - 2:33)
Chris are you are you the player that&#39;s (2:32 - 2:35)
like I need to get as many suun as (2:33 - 2:37)
possible or are you good with like one (2:35 - 2:40)
and done I&#39;m good with like two or three (2:37 - 2:42)
cuz we get we get next week two right I (2:40 - 2:44)
mean two or three yeah two two or three (2:42 - 2:45)
like I&#39;m banking biscuits for the next (2:44 - 2:47)
one already I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve got two on (2:45 - 2:50)
Deck um and so and an incense so I (2:47 - 2:54)
should be good to get three at least two (2:50 - 2:56)
so I guess the answer is yes I don&#39;t (2:54 - 2:58)
know are we are you judging me already (2:56 - 3:01)
this we just started okay I guess Steve (2:58 - 3:05)
is I am not I am not um but I also got (3:01 - 3:09)
my suun uh I it also took me to incense (3:05 - 3:12)
because I forget how I I did it but yeah (3:09 - 3:14)
wasn&#39;t hungry so you know I had went (3:12 - 3:17)
with biscuits and then it got full not (3:14 - 3:19)
as close as to one heart left as as (3:17 - 3:22)
yours but uh yeah so I needed to run the (3:19 - 3:25)
second incense got the (3:22 - 3:29)
suun I am personally I think I&#39;m okay (3:25 - 3:31)
with not getting another one like I (3:29 - 3:33)
don&#39;t really use Reiko that often I (3:31 - 3:36)
don&#39;t really use ente that often so I (3:33 - 3:38)
don&#39;t think I used them at all I don&#39;t (3:36 - 3:39)
know that I would (3:38 - 3:41)
you no why are you getting three with (3:39 - 3:44)
that I I love suun it&#39;s like what Lugia (3:41 - 3:46)
and suun are my favorite legendaries so (3:44 - 3:49)
like I feel obligated you know like okay (3:46 - 3:50)
I got to hold the flag for everybody (3:49 - 3:52)
else you know Steve has like 12 crar (3:50 - 3:55)
ants so you can&#39;t I mean right get it I (3:52 - 3:58)
get it um but uh yeah no I think I&#39;ll be (3:55 - 4:00)
good with the one and then I&#39;m just (3:58 - 4:02)
stacking up the main to buy all the (4:00 - 4:05)
other you know the main skill seed and (4:02 - 4:09)
the candy and or the um yeah like the (4:05 - 4:10)
handy candy and then all of that stuff (4:09 - 4:13)
so uh we&#39;ll see I might change my mind (4:10 - 4:16)
and want to try for like a shiny one or (4:13 - 4:20)
whatever but probably not I think I (4:16 - 4:23)
think with uh raicho I got three and (4:20 - 4:25)
then I bought the final incense which I (4:23 - 4:28)
still have to this day nice and then (4:25 - 4:32)
with with ente I got two and then I got (4:28 - 4:35)
the incense for a rainy day and I think (4:32 - 4:36)
with suun I&#39;ll probably be the same I (4:35 - 4:39)
think I&#39;ll just get one more because I (4:36 - 4:42)
caught my suun earlier this (4:39 - 4:45)
week um so yeah I&#39;ll probably just get (4:42 - 4:46)
like one more suun and then get the (4:45 - 4:48)
incense before it goes away and then I (4:46 - 4:52)
just have three incense that maybe one (4:48 - 4:54)
day I&#39;ll use I don&#39;t know what the (4:52 - 4:57)
occasion would be Steve is an incense (4:54 - 4:59)
collector in the way that you are a TCG (4:57 - 5:01)
collector you don&#39;t open anything it&#39;s (4:59 - 5:03)
like you&#39;re a sealed product collector (5:01 - 5:05)
so you just have incense that you&#39;re (5:03 - 5:07)
never going to use and then one day (5:05 - 5:08)
you&#39;ll sell your sleep account to (5:07 - 5:10)
somebody for a ton of money because you (5:08 - 5:15)
have legendary beast uh incense PSA 10 (5:10 - 5:18)
Pokemon sleep account so I I I just (5:15 - 5:20)
checked I do have three Raichu and and (5:18 - 5:22)
three ente as well and I know I have (5:20 - 5:24)
extra incense so so Steve what is your (5:22 - 5:26)
plan do you actually plan on using these (5:24 - 5:28)
at all in the future or no cuz you the (5:26 - 5:29)
two of you are much more into this game (5:28 - 5:31)
than I am right like I just Auto cook (5:29 - 5:33)
and I and I sleep I do those two things (5:31 - 5:36)
Auto cooker I&#39;m an auto cooker yeah (5:33 - 5:37)
that&#39;s right you said that last time I (5:36 - 5:38)
was (5:37 - 5:41)
like my sins laid bare before you in the (5:38 - 5:44)
audience absolutely you know no (5:41 - 5:47)
shame (5:44 - 5:49)
goodness I would (5:47 - 5:53)
probably save the incense for like I (5:49 - 5:55)
guess a perfect situation would be like (5:53 - 5:57)
let&#39;s say like a future water week or (5:55 - 6:00)
something okay uh where water type (5:57 - 6:02)
Pokemon are boosted or you get more (6:00 - 6:04)
candy for them or there&#39;s more dream (6:02 - 6:06)
shards for water type Pokemon I would (6:04 - 6:08)
probably save a future suun incense for (6:06 - 6:11)
that plus have like an extra master ball (6:08 - 6:13)
on Deck (6:11 - 6:16)
okay okay I think I can do that but I (6:13 - 6:18)
would also probably go into my Pokedex (6:16 - 6:20)
and see like oh I&#39;m (6:18 - 6:25)
missing suun sleep level three so on (6:20 - 6:27)
green grass you have to be at least what (6:25 - 6:29)
like master rank 16 to get like level (6:27 - 6:32)
three twon or something something like (6:29 - 6:33)
that yeah okay so it would be have it (6:32 - 6:35)
would have to be a combination of like (6:33 - 6:38)
missing the last pokedex entry have a (6:35 - 6:41)
spare master ball usually of like (6:38 - 6:44)
probably an event to coincide (6:41 - 6:47)
with that I I I do have to I have to (6:44 - 6:49)
file one complaint with Pokemon sleep I (6:47 - 6:51)
don&#39;t have many just this one when you (6:49 - 6:53)
complete your sleep research styles for (6:51 - 6:54)
a particular Pokemon the fact that (6:53 - 6:57)
there&#39;s no completion bonus blows my (6:54 - 7:01)
mind oh yeah know I wish they made a (6:57 - 7:02)
little bit of a bigger deal out of the (7:01 - 7:05)
fact that you do complete those um those (7:02 - 7:08)
sleep style thing uh the Sleep style (7:05 - 7:10)
decks I guess for like a specific (7:08 - 7:12)
Pokemon yeah yeah because there&#39;s so (7:10 - 7:14)
many in the game that like all the all (7:12 - 7:16)
the Milestones to unlock the other other (7:14 - 7:18)
things with those you&#39;re going to hit (7:16 - 7:20)
that no problem and so there&#39;s really no (7:18 - 7:21)
reason to like want to hunt down like (7:20 - 7:24)
you&#39;re missing one cuz there so many (7:21 - 7:25)
other low hanging fruit you could get (7:24 - 7:27)
for that total number right that&#39;s true (7:25 - 7:29)
you don&#39;t yeah there&#39;s not anything I (7:27 - 7:31)
guess it&#39;s just just getting uh (7:29 - 7:33)
unlocking the next like section or (7:31 - 7:35)
whatever right so oh yeah to that point (7:33 - 7:38)
I actually unlocked I unlocked lapis (7:35 - 7:40)
this week as well so I was excited to (7:38 - 7:43)
get to that point too but so I guess you (7:40 - 7:45)
have that but yeah it would be kind of (7:43 - 7:46)
nice with all the other bonuses that (7:45 - 7:49)
they give you like you caught 10 normal (7:46 - 7:51)
types you researched 20 normal typ you (7:49 - 7:52)
know and it&#39;s just it&#39;s 10 diamonds or (7:51 - 7:54)
15 diamond or whatever it may be like it (7:52 - 7:56)
would be kind of cool if you got a (7:54 - 7:58)
little bonus for completing an (7:56 - 8:01)
individual Pokemon&#39;s sleep style decks (7:58 - 8:04)
mhm I don&#39;t think Bobby&#39;s going to go to (8:01 - 8:06)
lapis next week you could go to lapis (8:04 - 8:07)
for (8:06 - 8:10)
suun I thought about it because this was (8:07 - 8:12)
my this was my logic and then someone in (8:10 - 8:15)
the slack actually corrected me um which (8:12 - 8:18)
was good because so we know we get like (8:15 - 8:20)
a bigger Snorlax for week two right we (8:18 - 8:23)
know it starts at a higher level yeah um (8:20 - 8:25)
or like a higher you know you yeah it (8:23 - 8:28)
starts at a higher level so on green (8:25 - 8:30)
grass in the past it has started at (8:28 - 8:34)
Ultra 4 right but because cyan and Lapis (8:30 - 8:35)
have (8:34 - 8:38)
different uh Power to get to certain (8:35 - 8:40)
levels right so like your Snorlax that (8:38 - 8:44)
you get on lapis is going to start at (8:40 - 8:45)
not Ultra four right it&#39;s going to start (8:44 - 8:49)
at a lower level than it would be on (8:45 - 8:51)
green (8:49 - 8:53)
grass right because it&#39;s just it&#39;s the (8:51 - 8:55)
Sleep power that you&#39;re or like it&#39;s the (8:53 - 8:56)
Sleep power that&#39;s going to be is the (8:55 - 8:58)
same between the islands but that sleep (8:56 - 9:02)
power is going to get you less far on (8:58 - 9:03)
it&#39;s going to get you further on green (9:02 - 9:05)
grass than it will get you on lapis (9:03 - 9:07)
right so if green grass is alra four (9:05 - 9:09)
lapis is probably going to be like great (9:07 - 9:12)
one yeah right so I was mis I was (9:09 - 9:14)
misunderstanding it to think like oh if (9:12 - 9:17)
I I&#39;ll start way ahead on lapis and then (9:14 - 9:18)
it was you know corrected to like no no (9:17 - 9:20)
you won&#39;t actually start way ahead on (9:18 - 9:22)
lapis like you&#39;ll only be like great one (9:20 - 9:26)
when you start see ekins and Bulbasaur (9:22 - 9:29)
and bells Sprout on lapis if you&#39;re low (9:26 - 9:32)
ranked that&#39;s all you&#39;re getting yeah so (9:29 - 9:35)
all of that to say I was going I thought (9:32 - 9:37)
about going to lapis and cuz I&#39;m going (9:35 - 9:38)
to be using a good camp ticket and (9:37 - 9:40)
everything too so I was like well maybe (9:38 - 9:44)
this is where I just jump right in no no (9:40 - 9:45)
I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m gonna end I&#39;m going to (9:44 - 9:47)
beach I&#39;m going to beach so first week (9:45 - 9:49)
on lapis I also used a good camp ticket (9:47 - 9:52)
and I think I ended at like Ultra 3 or (9:49 - 9:56)
something yeah no I had a very a very uh (9:52 - 9:59)
demotivating time on lapis twice and I&#39;m (9:56 - 10:01)
like I&#39;ll come back in a year how about (9:59 - 10:04)
that you know like (10:01 - 10:06)
gosh uh I might go to lapis though this (10:04 - 10:08)
week you going to go to beach Chris (10:06 - 10:09)
where are you GNA go I&#39;ll probably go to (10:08 - 10:11)
beach as well I&#39;m I&#39;m good with green (10:09 - 10:15)
grass for a couple weeks I think yep (10:11 - 10:16)
yeah I think I&#39;m uh I think I&#39;m only (10:15 - 10:19)
going to lapis because I&#39;m still looking (10:16 - 10:22)
for Ralts so oh yeah this is just a (10:19 - 10:26)
lifelong journey for you find R I think (10:22 - 10:28)
Den is also on lapis and I think crr&#39;s (10:26 - 10:32)
also on lapis no kar&#39;s I think on snow (10:28 - 10:36)
drop but Den is on Lapras lap lapis (10:32 - 10:38)
lapis there is no lapis in the (10:36 - 10:43)
game not yet not yet um but what was I G (10:38 - 10:45)
shoot (10:43 - 10:50)
uman I was thinking about uh how there&#39;s (10:45 - 10:52)
so many so like there&#39;s so many water (10:50 - 10:54)
Pokemon obviously because it&#39;s s week (10:52 - 10:57)
but I feel like I&#39;m like water Pokemon (10:54 - 11:00)
out at this point just because there was (10:57 - 11:03)
so much I think it&#39;s because raicho (11:00 - 11:05)
happened and then ente happened just a (11:03 - 11:07)
month later right so and I was just (11:05 - 11:08)
starting so there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of (11:07 - 11:10)
time between there but then there was (11:08 - 11:12)
like a two-month gap between ente and (11:10 - 11:16)
suun but like because ente happened so (11:12 - 11:18)
quickly after raicho it was like (11:16 - 11:19)
immediately like oh I need to catch fire (11:18 - 11:22)
Pokemon and then when ente left it was (11:19 - 11:23)
like I need to start catching water (11:22 - 11:25)
Pokemon except that then that dragged (11:23 - 11:28)
out for two months instead of one month (11:25 - 11:30)
and so I&#39;m like what Pokemon out because (11:28 - 11:32)
I&#39;ve been focusing on water Pokemon for (11:30 - 11:34)
like two months to get you know leading (11:32 - 11:38)
up to suun week um so I&#39;ll be ready to (11:34 - 11:40)
like maybe maybe I&#39;ll be going back to (11:38 - 11:42)
taupe after all of this is done maybe (11:40 - 11:43)
I&#39;ll just go back to taupe this week and (11:42 - 11:46)
forget s cot all together there you go I (11:43 - 11:49)
think (11:46 - 11:52)
probably I think it&#39;s so interesting (11:49 - 11:55)
how almost perfect the pacing is in (11:52 - 11:58)
Pokemon sleep like for Pokemon day they (11:55 - 12:00)
announced three Legend AR (11:58 - 12:02)
Pokemon and I think that&#39;s all we&#39;re (12:00 - 12:04)
getting this year like I don&#39;t think (12:02 - 12:06)
we&#39;re getting like a ho oh or a Lugia or (12:04 - 12:07)
anything like (12:06 - 12:11)
that and classic ho and Lugia niantic&#39;s (12:07 - 12:13)
two favorite (12:11 - 12:15)
legendaries But like (12:13 - 12:19)
after after suun week is over we&#39;re (12:15 - 12:22)
pretty close to like a Halloween (12:19 - 12:25)
event and then after that we&#39;re real (12:22 - 12:27)
close to they&#39;ll probably do the Eevee (12:25 - 12:29)
week again cuz Eevee day is what (12:27 - 12:32)
November 11th or something like that and (12:29 - 12:34)
then after that we&#39;ll get the Christmas (12:32 - 12:37)
event and then a New Year&#39;s Event and (12:34 - 12:39)
then they could probably chill for a (12:37 - 12:41)
like three weeks and then it&#39;s Pokemon (12:39 - 12:42)
day and Pokemon day they can announce (12:41 - 12:45)
three more legendaries or or whatnot and (12:42 - 12:48)
we can do the whole cycle again and it (12:45 - 12:51)
it&#39;s to me it&#39;s like relatively good (12:48 - 12:53)
pacing because we have all these other (12:51 - 12:54)
events in (12:53 - 12:56)
between (12:54 - 13:00)
um and I think I I think that&#39;s good (12:56 - 13:02)
uh I think a lot of players would maybe (13:00 - 13:04)
like a new island or something more but (13:02 - 13:06)
like they can still introduce new (13:04 - 13:08)
Pokemon with these events they can still (13:06 - 13:11)
bring back old events yeah I&#39;m sure (13:08 - 13:13)
we&#39;ll get more hat Pikachu event we have (13:11 - 13:15)
two in the game it&#39;s been a year we only (13:13 - 13:18)
have two costume Pikachu in the game (13:15 - 13:20)
outrageous I missed both of them (13:18 - 13:21)
unfortunately when are they going to (13:20 - 13:23)
unlock trading or uh open up trading in (13:21 - 13:25)
Pokemon sleep that&#39;s what we really need (13:23 - 13:28)
yeah we need wonder trade for costume (13:25 - 13:32)
Pikachu yeah yeah so I mean Steve you (13:28 - 13:33)
mentioned like you know getting a new (13:32 - 13:35)
spot like a new a new place to go would (13:33 - 13:37)
be great but at the same time we were (13:35 - 13:39)
just talking about like how snow drop (13:37 - 13:41)
and Lapis are like yeah like kind of (13:39 - 13:43)
Untouchable for a lot of people you know (13:41 - 13:44)
those of us that been playing every (13:43 - 13:46)
single day I mean like obviously I&#39;m (13:44 - 13:48)
very casual but I I I&#39;ve played every (13:46 - 13:50)
day and I still can&#39;t even like make a (13:48 - 13:55)
dent a meaningful dent in lapis really (13:50 - 13:59)
yeah yeah I I do wonder if they would (13:55 - 14:00)
have to (13:59 - 14:04)
if they would ever add an island that (14:00 - 14:07)
isn&#39;t uh that isn&#39;t focused on that (14:04 - 14:10)
isn&#39;t so far ahead right so it&#39;s like (14:07 - 14:13)
right now after lapis it&#39;s like 240 (14:10 - 14:16)
sleep styles to get lapis unlocked so (14:13 - 14:20)
then the next the next uh Mark to hit is (14:16 - 14:23)
290 sleep Styles which obviously doesn&#39;t (14:20 - 14:24)
unlock anything because lapis is the (14:23 - 14:26)
last one but I I I find it it would be (14:24 - 14:28)
tough if they were now releasing another (14:26 - 14:30)
Island where you had to have more than (14:28 - 14:32)
290 sleep Styles like I feel like they (14:30 - 14:35)
would want to do something where people (14:32 - 14:38)
that are newer could also like get in on (14:35 - 14:40)
it somehow so but I don&#39;t know how they (14:38 - 14:41)
would do that but that would be cool if (14:40 - 14:43)
they added something and then it wasn&#39;t (14:41 - 14:46)
just like oh now you have to have even (14:43 - 14:49)
more sleep styles to get that next (14:46 - 14:50)
Island well this February will be (14:49 - 14:53)
Pokemon sleep ex they&#39;re going to (14:50 - 14:56)
redo uh everything and how it&#39;s (14:53 - 14:58)
structured well they they did do that (14:56 - 15:00)
update where if if you were maxed out on (14:58 - 15:01)
something like green grass and you went (15:00 - 15:03)
to green grass that 5% would go (15:01 - 15:06)
elsewhere so you could be powering up (15:03 - 15:09)
snow drop for example without ever going (15:06 - 15:12)
to snow drop I don&#39;t think that makes (15:09 - 15:14)
snow drop like any better of a place (15:12 - 15:17)
unless you really want like a snow (15:14 - 15:19)
ver which isn&#39;t like a particularly (15:17 - 15:21)
great Pokemon (15:19 - 15:25)
but Chris disagrees I mean I I I like (15:21 - 15:27)
snow as a Pokemon who who doesn&#39;t you (15:25 - 15:30)
know but I I don&#39;t could not speak to (15:27 - 15:32)
its usefulness and sleep I could barely (15:30 - 15:34)
speak to su&#39;s usefulness and sleep at (15:32 - 15:36)
this point so you know I&#39;m I&#39;m going on (15:34 - 15:38)
favorites here you know it&#39;s a Vibe you (15:36 - 15:41)
know yeah yeah that&#39;s totally fine (15:38 - 15:44)
speaking of suun the music for suun we (15:41 - 15:48)
suun week has been awesome I would say (15:44 - 15:50)
of the three of the three legendaries (15:48 - 15:54)
we&#39;ve had so far the suun week music is (15:50 - 15:57)
definitely my favorite it&#39;s been great (15:54 - 16:00)
yeah it&#39;s good (15:57 - 16:02)
all right uh let&#39;s switch gears over (16:00 - 16:06)
here to incinerar the seven star (16:02 - 16:08)
incinerar made its debut literally like (16:06 - 16:10)
an hour after we were done recording the (16:08 - 16:12)
show last (16:10 - 16:15)
week uh they announced incar uh so that (16:12 - 16:18)
completes the uh blueberry Academy Elite (16:15 - 16:20)
4 which they were going in (16:18 - 16:23)
order they did go in order it&#39;s just in (16:20 - 16:24)
between they sprinkled other Pokemon so (16:23 - 16:29)
it was the Imp it was uh Blazin for (16:24 - 16:31)
Crispen gosh I got to remember the elite (16:29 - 16:35)
Four&#39;s name Blazin for krispen uh impon (16:31 - 16:38)
for Amor amoris was that her name and (16:35 - 16:43)
then primarina for Lacy septile for (16:38 - 16:45)
Drayton that&#39;s not his name (16:43 - 16:47)
Drayton (16:45 - 16:51)
sound I I that sounds right no okay uh (16:47 - 16:55)
and then uh incinerar for kierin so we (16:51 - 17:00)
have completed the Elite 4 (16:55 - 17:02)
plus (17:00 - 17:04)
Champion (17:02 - 17:07)
cinko five of (17:04 - 17:09)
them the Elite Four is never just four (17:07 - 17:12)
people uh that leaves that leaves four (17:09 - 17:15)
starter Pokemon left we have feraligator (17:12 - 17:20)
left uh we have uh (17:15 - 17:24)
Torterra Infernape and Superior so we (17:20 - 17:27)
have four starters that should get us (17:24 - 17:28)
through the end of the year but they (17:27 - 17:30)
could also do like a Christmas Pokemon (17:28 - 17:32)
like they did last time they did what (17:30 - 17:35)
iron bundle mhm last time for Christmas (17:32 - 17:37)
uh they could just do a straight up (17:35 - 17:40)
Seven Star Deli bird that would be (17:37 - 17:44)
cool did didn&#39;t they do that two years (17:40 - 17:46)
ago I think they did Five Star Deli (17:44 - 17:50)
Birds ah okay and they were just various (17:46 - 17:51)
terot types and I think they were (17:50 - 17:53)
dropping (17:51 - 17:56)
nuggets okay they could do a sevenstar (17:53 - 17:59)
Obama Snow (17:56 - 17:59)
there again appealing to the vibe you (18:00 - 18:04)
know (18:02 - 18:07)
yeah I I&#39;m uh if if I&#39;m going to guess (18:04 - 18:09)
Terra types I I did think that for (18:07 - 18:12)
alligator was going to be dark type Tera (18:09 - 18:15)
because of its ability and because it (18:12 - 18:18)
gets quite a few dark type moves uh I (18:15 - 18:19)
thought Infernape was going to be (18:18 - 18:22)
electric type Tera because (18:19 - 18:25)
of Goku Punch Yeah Thunder Punch and (18:22 - 18:29)
Dragon Ball Z reference yeah there we go (18:25 - 18:31)
[Laughter] (18:29 - 18:34)
uh I I I don&#39;t know about Superior I (18:31 - 18:36)
think if you pair its ability with (18:34 - 18:39)
Stellar that makes sense but I don&#39;t (18:36 - 18:42)
think they&#39;re just going to give (18:39 - 18:43)
Superior (18:42 - 18:47)
Stellar no I think be grass what about (18:43 - 18:48)
flying (18:47 - 18:51)
poric I don&#39;t does flying make sense for (18:48 - 18:55)
Superior aerial Ace I don&#39;t know (18:51 - 18:57)
man that&#39;s all I got Superior could also (18:55 - 18:58)
just be Dragon too it gets a lot of (18:57 - 19:02)
dragon typ moves as well and then what (18:58 - 19:03)
was the other one torta I have no clue (19:02 - 19:06)
for torta I feel like ground it&#39;s (19:03 - 19:07)
already (19:06 - 19:11)
ground wait torta is grass ground yeah (19:07 - 19:14)
how did I not know this I was thinking (19:11 - 19:16)
torta was pure grass for some reason no (19:14 - 19:19)
grass ground okay well then not ground (19:16 - 19:22)
we we did get a ground (19:19 - 19:25)
Venusaur okay which made sense for (19:22 - 19:27)
Venusaur right because they ran earth (19:25 - 19:30)
power h I don&#39;t know for (19:27 - 19:34)
torta yeah yeah I don&#39;t know for torta (19:30 - 19:36)
rock (19:34 - 19:39)
type does it know any rock type moves am (19:36 - 19:42)
I just making I think it does okay if I (19:39 - 19:44)
was to really stretch if my mental (19:42 - 19:47)
gymnastics is is as flexible as it can (19:44 - 19:52)
be I would say fairy because the cherry (19:47 - 19:56)
blossoms of the bonsai tree something (19:52 - 19:58)
like that I don&#39;t know but I don&#39;t think (19:56 - 20:00)
it gets any Fair moves so that&#39;s just (19:58 - 20:02)
don&#39;t that&#39;s just me talking out loud (20:00 - 20:05)
ignore that has has there been a uh (20:02 - 20:09)
Terra type A type not in the Seven Star (20:05 - 20:10)
I don&#39;t know if you can remember this (20:09 - 20:13)
the last one was dark so completed that (20:10 - 20:15)
yeah but so there has there&#39;s been oh (20:13 - 20:18)
the last type was dark the yeah no (20:15 - 20:21)
Charizard was Dark Charizard was (20:18 - 20:24)
Dragon I keep forgetting because the TCG (20:21 - 20:26)
Charizard the Terra is dark yes in the (20:24 - 20:28)
TCG Charizard is dark I keep for I keep (20:26 - 20:31)
for that the seven star was Dragon but I (20:28 - 20:33)
think in the TCG the Charizard is dark (20:31 - 20:35)
because it makes references to Freed&#39;s (20:33 - 20:38)
Charizard which is spoiler for the third (20:35 - 20:40)
episode of the anime freed Charizard is (20:38 - 20:42)
dark yeah well we got we also did get a (20:40 - 20:45)
dark Terra Charizard as a gift at one (20:42 - 20:47)
point in time in Mystery Gift (20:45 - 20:50)
distribution yeah (20:47 - 20:54)
yeah um (20:50 - 20:54)
the (20:54 - 20:59)
the I do I do a lot of of seven star (20:57 - 21:01)
raids a lot I I do probably more (20:59 - 21:05)
sevenstar raids than maybe any other (21:01 - 21:07)
person (21:05 - 21:11)
ever I I I sit there every weekend they (21:07 - 21:16)
come out I I we have a rotating cast of (21:11 - 21:18)
twitch viewers or even people from the (21:16 - 21:20)
slack or the Discord that don&#39;t really (21:18 - 21:21)
watch Twitch they but they&#39;ll pop in and (21:20 - 21:23)
they&#39;ll be like I I can&#39;t get this done (21:21 - 21:26)
can you help me um and I have a pretty (21:23 - 21:30)
good track record of getting move sets (21:26 - 21:32)
right like I do these YouTube videos of (21:30 - 21:34)
breaking down what I think is going to (21:32 - 21:35)
happen and I think I&#39;ve gotten everyone (21:34 - 21:37)
right except Mewtwo but like literally (21:35 - 21:39)
no one got Mewtwo right because Mewtwo (21:37 - 21:42)
was in its own category (21:39 - 21:45)
of uniqueness uh and then the only one I (21:42 - 21:46)
really got wrong the only one I (21:45 - 21:49)
definitely got wrong was Meganium like (21:46 - 21:51)
did not expect a psychic Meganium to run (21:49 - 21:55)
a fighting type body press (21:51 - 21:55)
moves April fools to me there you (21:56 - 22:06)
go um so inin ran darkest Lariat it ran (22:01 - 22:07)
flare Blitz those are the two moves that (22:06 - 22:09)
I was like for sure going to get it (22:07 - 22:12)
opens up with taunt which if you look at (22:09 - 22:13)
my YouTube video I go it&#39;s probably (22:12 - 22:15)
going to open with taunt uh and then it (22:13 - 22:19)
had earthquake um and then iron head so (22:15 - 22:21)
I I (22:19 - 22:24)
do there there has to be like part of (22:21 - 22:27)
me that&#39;s like somebody somebody at game (22:24 - 22:29)
freak who&#39;s I don&#39;t know how many people (22:27 - 22:31)
is it one dude at game freak that&#39;s like (22:29 - 22:33)
you&#39;re in charge of the Seven Star raids (22:31 - 22:35)
figure it out or is it like a team of (22:33 - 22:38)
people but the there&#39;s part of me that&#39;s (22:35 - 22:41)
that&#39;s thinking they must know what (22:38 - 22:44)
Pokemon are like popular or what like (22:41 - 22:46)
what Pokemon are seeing the most usage (22:44 - 22:50)
in raids or like they must have some (22:46 - 22:53)
sort of concept of like we want to see (22:50 - 22:56)
our players lean in this direction and (22:53 - 22:59)
build these counters for this Pokemon (22:56 - 23:02)
like they have to have a solution to the (22:59 - 23:04)
puzzle they are building and that&#39;s what (23:02 - 23:07)
seven star raids are they&#39;re they&#39;re (23:04 - 23:09)
just a puzzle like once you figure out (23:07 - 23:13)
the puzzle they&#39;re relatively easy uh (23:09 - 23:16)
unless little uh unless you know Cindy (23:13 - 23:19)
over here is bringing like a level SE 62 (23:16 - 23:20)
hoopa and then it&#39;s like an auto loss (23:19 - 23:22)
because there ain&#39;t no way that Hoopa (23:20 - 23:23)
surviving (23:22 - 23:28)
anything um and all week all week when I (23:23 - 23:30)
was building raid stuff where we were (23:28 - 23:32)
leading up people were like do bun has (23:30 - 23:34)
to be perfect here right like you got to (23:32 - 23:37)
bring the do bun oh sorry doc buun doc (23:34 - 23:41)
you got to bring the dog and I was like (23:37 - 23:43)
I don&#39;t think so man like I think the (23:41 - 23:46)
dog&#39;s a little a little dead weight (23:43 - 23:48)
because the dog can&#39;t in because the the (23:46 - 23:51)
concept was Doc spun would would take a (23:48 - 23:53)
fire type move increase its defense and (23:51 - 23:55)
then body press which is super effective (23:53 - 23:58)
against incinerar and I&#39;m and I&#39;m like (23:55 - 24:00)
but what if the Inc doesn&#39;t want to use (23:58 - 24:02)
a fire type move against you then your (24:00 - 24:04)
defense doesn&#39;t go up and then your body (24:02 - 24:06)
presses don&#39;t do anything and what if (24:04 - 24:09)
incinerar has bulk up which it end ends (24:06 - 24:11)
up having and you&#39;re like a plus three (24:09 - 24:13)
dock spun and the incinerar is plus six (24:11 - 24:15)
and it ain&#39;t using any fire type moves (24:13 - 24:16)
against you so I don&#39;t know what your (24:15 - 24:18)
little doggy&#39;s going to (24:16 - 24:20)
do uh and that&#39;s exactly what happened (24:18 - 24:22)
because the incinerar would use a super (24:20 - 24:26)
effective iron head instead of the not (24:22 - 24:28)
effective flare Blitz and then the (24:26 - 24:32)
little dog does not go bark bark he goes (24:28 - 24:34)
dead dead back in the (24:32 - 24:38)
Pokeball um dead (24:34 - 24:41)
dead for our for our audio listeners (24:38 - 24:45)
Bob&#39;s on the verge of tears right (24:41 - 24:45)
now the other thing I&#39;ll say is um I I (24:49 - 24:56)
absolutely love Seven Star raids I think (24:53 - 24:58)
they&#39;re they&#39;re so fun I&#39;ve talked about (24:56 - 25:00)
how ra are some of my favorite content (24:58 - 25:02)
in Pokemon (25:00 - 25:05)
games and and there&#39;s always this (25:02 - 25:06)
conversation of like whether they&#39;re too (25:05 - 25:09)
easy or whether they&#39;re too hard (25:06 - 25:13)
uh and I I think that&#39;s such (25:09 - 25:17)
a that&#39;s such a hard thing to like (25:13 - 25:19)
pinpoint because going back to what I (25:17 - 25:22)
said earlier if you know what to do in (25:19 - 25:24)
the raid let&#39;s say it&#39;s the three of us (25:22 - 25:26)
in a raid it&#39;s it&#39;s me Bobby and Chris (25:24 - 25:29)
we all know what to do we all brought (25:26 - 25:33)
adequate counters and we just a a fourth (25:29 - 25:34)
random person (25:33 - 25:37)
joins and we have no clue the on paper (25:34 - 25:39)
it looks like they&#39;re bringing an okay (25:37 - 25:42)
Pokemon and the raid starts and their (25:39 - 25:44)
Pokemon&#39;s not level 100 it&#39;s like level (25:42 - 25:47)
80 they have they let&#39;s say they brought (25:44 - 25:50)
a Blastoise cool Blastoise seems to be (25:47 - 25:53)
okay it has high defense resist fire (25:50 - 25:56)
type moves resist the iron head but the (25:53 - 25:58)
Blastoise is level 80 its move set is (25:56 - 26:02)
surf bubble beam waterfall skull bash (25:58 - 26:03)
there&#39;s no held (26:02 - 26:06)
item so you can say that like oh this (26:03 - 26:09)
raid is easy me Chris and Bobby have (26:06 - 26:11)
completed it 10 times no problem but the (26:09 - 26:15)
second that fourth person joins you&#39;re (26:11 - 26:18)
like oh we literally cannot win like (26:15 - 26:20)
this person&#39;s just going to get knocked (26:18 - 26:22)
out no matter we&#39;ll set the reflex we&#39;ll (26:20 - 26:24)
we&#39;ll do whatever but they&#39;re going to (26:22 - 26:25)
get knocked out we&#39;re going to lose (26:24 - 26:26)
timer they&#39;re going to come back in (26:25 - 26:27)
they&#39;re going to get knocked out we&#39;re (26:26 - 26:29)
going to lose timer and and now the (26:27 - 26:32)
raate is over now we (26:29 - 26:32)
failed (26:34 - 26:37)
So Good Vibes only does not work in this (26:37 - 26:41)
case is what you&#39;re getting at is that (26:40 - 26:43)
what you&#39;re saying I see yeah different (26:41 - 26:45)
game than sleep for (26:43 - 26:48)
[Laughter] (26:45 - 26:51)
sure I think it is that difficult is (26:48 - 26:53)
that difficulty though or or like I mean (26:51 - 26:55)
like okay so it&#39;s definitely a pain (26:53 - 26:57)
point right because you can&#39;t you can&#39;t (26:55 - 26:58)
be like okay I&#39;m going to set up this (26:57 - 27:01)
group and only level 100 can join right (26:58 - 27:03)
um so I I guess it poses this an (27:01 - 27:06)
interesting question like in in order to (27:03 - 27:08)
in order to make that format of the (27:06 - 27:10)
puzzle like you&#39;re describing work for (27:08 - 27:12)
more players and be more appealing to to (27:10 - 27:15)
make it easier so like a level 80 could (27:12 - 27:17)
still succeed with a with a greater (27:15 - 27:19)
margin of error or do you keep that sort (27:17 - 27:22)
of like almost competitive nature of (27:19 - 27:25)
like Min maxing the Pokemon and then (27:22 - 27:28)
hoping and praying that everybody else (27:25 - 27:29)
is as serious about it as you are as you (27:28 - 27:31)
get into these groups or are they trying (27:29 - 27:33)
to force you to go to these communities (27:31 - 27:36)
where you&#39;re curating your entire team (27:33 - 27:39)
and that&#39;s that right right I mean what (27:36 - 27:41)
would help the most is if more people (27:39 - 27:44)
just watched Steve video Steve&#39;s videos (27:41 - 27:46)
on YouTube I send them to everybody is (27:44 - 27:50)
not an ad for my YouTube (27:46 - 27:53)
channel well I think like the the amount (27:50 - 27:55)
of work you have to do to unlock Seven (27:53 - 27:57)
Star raids is kind of crazy you got to (27:55 - 28:00)
beat the game you got meet Mr Ed shearon (27:57 - 28:02)
at the end uh and then after you meet Ed (28:00 - 28:05)
Sheeran you have to rebattle all the gym (28:02 - 28:07)
leaders which is not like it&#39;s not like (28:05 - 28:10)
a 10minute thing right it&#39;s like that&#39;s (28:07 - 28:12)
like a that&#39;s like an hour and a half of (28:10 - 28:15)
like a slog like a like a huge slog you (28:12 - 28:17)
have to do and if you just beat the game (28:15 - 28:19)
I feel like as soon as credits roll and (28:17 - 28:20)
they&#39;re like beat eight more Gym Leaders (28:19 - 28:23)
they&#39;re like give me like a day or two (28:20 - 28:25)
like decompressed like you want me to so (28:23 - 28:27)
after you beat a gym leaders you got to (28:25 - 28:30)
do the the tournament which again is (28:27 - 28:31)
just more battles it&#39;s just a lot of (28:30 - 28:33)
battling MH so that&#39;s another four (28:31 - 28:37)
battles that you got to do um and then (28:33 - 28:40)
after that you got to do what is it like (28:37 - 28:42)
10 five star raids or something like (28:40 - 28:43)
that yeah something like 10 or 15 five (28:42 - 28:45)
star (28:43 - 28:48)
raids like it it is still it is a little (28:45 - 28:51)
weird a little crazy that you have to do (28:48 - 28:54)
that much work and then when you get (28:51 - 28:56)
there and you go to like the random cuz (28:54 - 28:57)
sometimes I&#39;ll also jump in like the the (28:56 - 29:00)
random like the the The sevenstar Raid (28:57 - 29:01)
roulette I&#39;m like oh I want to see what (29:00 - 29:03)
other people are (29:01 - 29:05)
bringing and you you get there and (29:03 - 29:07)
you&#39;re just like what are these Pokemon (29:05 - 29:10)
choices like why why are you deciding to (29:07 - 29:14)
bring this to this raid like I don&#39;t (29:10 - 29:15)
know what your move set is I don&#39;t know (29:14 - 29:17)
if you&#39;re holding a held item I don&#39;t (29:15 - 29:19)
know what level you are I just know that (29:17 - 29:21)
this Pokemon is going to faint right (29:19 - 29:25)
away because it&#39;s weak to dark type and (29:21 - 29:29)
like I saw somebody lock in Golden go (29:25 - 29:31)
like you&#39;re weak to Fire and you&#39;re weak (29:29 - 29:33)
to (29:31 - 29:33)
dark I&#39;m gonna guess it&#39;s level 100 (29:34 - 29:39)
because that&#39;s probably why you&#39;re (29:37 - 29:41)
locking it in like ah it&#39;s my only level (29:39 - 29:44)
100 so I I&#39;m going to lock it in (29:41 - 29:47)
yep I know we&#39;ve had this conversation (29:44 - 29:50)
before I want to have it again I I I I (29:47 - 29:53)
absolutely hate I will always give push (29:50 - 29:56)
back when people say Pokemon is a kids (29:53 - 30:00)
game I hate it I hate it it&#39;s the same (29:56 - 30:04)
energy of like you telling somebody it&#39;s (30:00 - 30:06)
this is not a Perfect Analogy but it&#39;s (30:04 - 30:08)
the same energy of you telling somebody (30:06 - 30:11)
you&#39;re like a wrestling fan and the like (30:08 - 30:14)
them being excited to tell you that it&#39;s (30:11 - 30:19)
fake like brother I know like if if (30:14 - 30:21)
we&#39;re watching if we&#39;re watching Game of (30:19 - 30:23)
Thrones on the couch together I&#39;m not (30:21 - 30:25)
going to lean over and go hey did you (30:23 - 30:29)
know dragons aren&#39;t real this show is (30:25 - 30:32)
fake cuz those aren&#39;t real like like I (30:29 - 30:36)
know it&#39;s not real but I don&#39;t like no (30:32 - 30:38)
one ever does this to like somebody (30:36 - 30:40)
playing Mario like they don&#39;t lean over (30:38 - 30:42)
and they&#39;re like hey Super Mario (30:40 - 30:45)
Brothers that&#39;s a kids game like no one (30:42 - 30:48)
ever so I think that where that may come (30:45 - 30:50)
from at least for some people I&#39;m not I (30:48 - 30:53)
can&#39;t say for all obviously but for the (30:50 - 30:54)
like for the for instance for the (30:53 - 30:56)
wrestling is fake thing I think it might (30:54 - 30:58)
be more internal for them because at one (30:56 - 31:00)
point in their life they didn&#39;t know (30:58 - 31:03)
wrestling was fake and when they found (31:00 - 31:05)
out it was they were probably so (31:03 - 31:07)
disappointed whole world shatter that (31:05 - 31:09)
they had to now tell other people that (31:07 - 31:12)
it&#39;s fake because they were so they felt (31:09 - 31:14)
so Bamboozled when they found out that (31:12 - 31:16)
wrestling was fake when they were (31:14 - 31:18)
growing up that they now have to put (31:16 - 31:21)
that on others so that they don&#39;t aren&#39;t (31:18 - 31:24)
the only ones that feel bad for learning (31:21 - 31:27)
that and I think that that same thing (31:24 - 31:29)
May kind of go for something like (31:27 - 31:32)
Pokémon where it was like as a kid I (31:29 - 31:33)
think all of us were in the position (31:32 - 31:34)
where when we were kids I think we&#39;re (31:33 - 31:36)
all around the same age and that when we (31:34 - 31:39)
were kids Pokemon was really fun and (31:36 - 31:42)
popular and then we got to an age where (31:39 - 31:44)
it wasn&#39;t popular to like Pokemon (31:42 - 31:45)
anymore right we all got there was a (31:44 - 31:48)
stage of school right where people were (31:45 - 31:50)
like that&#39;s not you don&#39;t play Pokemon (31:48 - 31:52)
that&#39;s not cool well there was a lot of (31:50 - 31:53)
things in that stage of school that were (31:52 - 31:56)
not popular AB absolutely he was a very (31:53 - 32:00)
narrow uh path to follow right but uh (31:56 - 32:02)
but I feel like it&#39;s that same thing (32:00 - 32:05)
it&#39;s those same people who loved Pokemon (32:02 - 32:07)
or had that like passion or loved that (32:05 - 32:10)
thing as a kid and then got like made (32:07 - 32:12)
fun of at some point or then got the you (32:10 - 32:14)
can&#39;t like this it&#39;s not cool and then (32:12 - 32:16)
got stuck in that and then as they grow (32:14 - 32:18)
up they&#39;re like yeah Pokemon&#39;s a kids (32:16 - 32:20)
game because because I had to stop (32:18 - 32:22)
playing it at a certain age you know and (32:20 - 32:25)
so it&#39;s a kids game it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a (32:22 - 32:28)
game for adults or whatever um kind of (32:25 - 32:31)
yeah they really do honestly that would (32:28 - 32:33)
be helpful there there&#39;s there&#39;s no like (32:31 - 32:35)
denial that when the Pokemon boom (32:33 - 32:37)
happened in the late 90s that they did (32:35 - 32:40)
heavily marketed towards kids but that&#39;s (32:37 - 32:42)
like no different than Nintendo heavily (32:40 - 32:45)
marketing towards boys because video (32:42 - 32:48)
games were seen as a boy (32:45 - 32:52)
toy whereas like oh girls don&#39;t play (32:48 - 32:53)
video games but obviously that&#39;s just (32:52 - 32:55)
not true but again I think that falls in (32:53 - 32:59)
that same stigma of like well well games (32:55 - 33:03)
are for kids slash games are for boys (32:59 - 33:04)
where it&#39;s like no gaming is for (33:03 - 33:06)
everyone (33:04 - 33:09)
like men women boys girls non-binary (33:06 - 33:13)
like for everyone and so when people say (33:09 - 33:15)
oh Pokemon&#39;s like you&#39;re just playing a (33:13 - 33:17)
kids game it&#39;s easy for everyone it just (33:15 - 33:21)
it gives that like that energy of like (33:17 - 33:24)
also video games should be for boys yeah (33:21 - 33:27)
yeah yeah definitely definitely well it (33:24 - 33:29)
also gives that energy of like video (33:27 - 33:32)
games should be for kids and I think (33:29 - 33:33)
when we were (33:32 - 33:36)
kids adults all kinds of people played (33:33 - 33:38)
video games as long as video games have (33:36 - 33:41)
been a thing obviously but I do feel (33:38 - 33:45)
like we our generation and I guess the (33:41 - 33:47)
one right before us as well kind of grew (33:45 - 33:51)
up with video games and now this (33:47 - 33:54)
generation is all adults right and so I (33:51 - 33:56)
I feel like games are even marketed (33:54 - 33:58)
toward more more toward everybody than (33:56 - 33:59)
kids than they ever have been in the (33:58 - 34:02)
past right like it&#39;s now things are now (33:59 - 34:04)
marketed toward everyone when it comes (34:02 - 34:06)
to video games (34:04 - 34:08)
because I think I&#39;m safe to say like (34:06 - 34:11)
more adults play video games now than (34:08 - 34:14)
did when we were kids I would say and I (34:11 - 34:15)
think that&#39;s because there&#39;s more (34:14 - 34:16)
options there it&#39;s more availability (34:15 - 34:18)
when you bring in Mobile as well there&#39;s (34:16 - 34:23)
just a lot more of um access to it for (34:18 - 34:27)
people of all ages right so uh it&#39;s it (34:23 - 34:28)
is a weird argument to then be like oh (34:27 - 34:30)
this is a kid&#39;s game or whatever because (34:28 - 34:32)
it does it it it takes me back to (34:30 - 34:35)
feeling like when I played video games (34:32 - 34:37)
as a kid and then like all the adults (34:35 - 34:39)
were like this is such a kid thing like (34:37 - 34:41)
just for playing video games in general (34:39 - 34:42)
when it&#39;s like it never has it really (34:41 - 34:44)
never has been but way going to grow out (34:42 - 34:47)
of these video games yeah yeah exactly (34:44 - 34:49)
exactly I remember my dad introducing me (34:47 - 34:51)
to like really early video games when I (34:49 - 34:53)
was really small and the like the one (34:51 - 34:55)
family computer in the basement I I (34:53 - 34:58)
challenge adults today to go try to (34:55 - 35:00)
complete Mist by themselves are you (34:58 - 35:02)
kidding me that game came out like in (35:00 - 35:04)
the like the mid 90s or whatever like (35:02 - 35:05)
you can&#39;t even do that today without a (35:04 - 35:08)
guide like come on no this is just a (35:05 - 35:10)
stigma that has thankfully sort of like (35:08 - 35:12)
fallen off I mean like and then you you (35:10 - 35:14)
sort of get close to the whole or video (35:12 - 35:16)
games art conversation I feel like it is (35:14 - 35:18)
in the same room as this conversation (35:16 - 35:21)
right um but yeah I don&#39;t know I feel (35:18 - 35:22)
like people confuse (35:21 - 35:25)
accessibility um with things being for (35:22 - 35:27)
children only that&#39;s not the case just (35:25 - 35:29)
because a child came part participate (35:27 - 35:31)
doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s just for kids (35:29 - 35:34)
right I mean anybody can play a Pokemon (35:31 - 35:36)
game anybody can play a Pokemon game and (35:34 - 35:38)
and find some success in it it&#39;s (35:36 - 35:41)
designed to do that so it doesn&#39;t scare (35:38 - 35:42)
people off or make them upset when they (35:41 - 35:45)
play it you know but there&#39;s the other (35:42 - 35:46)
end of the Spectrum which are these (35:45 - 35:48)
Seven Star raids you&#39;re describing that (35:46 - 35:50)
if it isn&#39;t next to perfect it&#39;s going (35:48 - 35:52)
to fall apart you know yeah there there (35:50 - 35:56)
is a there&#39;s like a level (35:52 - 35:59)
of preparation that you need to do for a (35:56 - 36:01)
sevenstar raid and I think that&#39;s great (35:59 - 36:05)
and I think that not everyone knows that (36:01 - 36:07)
preparation or knows where to go for (36:05 - 36:10)
that preparation or what to check um but (36:07 - 36:13)
to go back to like the kid (36:10 - 36:17)
conversation like I think (36:13 - 36:20)
I the first day that seven star raid the (36:17 - 36:21)
first day that incin came (36:20 - 36:25)
out no fails probably cleared it like 30 (36:21 - 36:28)
40 50 times every time I go through just (36:25 - 36:29)
a different set of people right like (36:28 - 36:32)
just drop your code I&#39;ll join other (36:29 - 36:34)
people will join we&#39;ll help you do it (36:32 - 36:37)
easy um we we got through it and then (36:34 - 36:40)
yesterday while I was doing it um or the (36:37 - 36:42)
day before I don&#39;t remember I don&#39;t even (36:40 - 36:44)
know what day it was uh for for some (36:42 - 36:48)
reason we had a bunch of like new people (36:44 - 36:50)
who uh probably found it through Twitter (36:48 - 36:52)
or whatnot and they were like I I I (36:50 - 36:54)
built this it wasn&#39;t working I built (36:52 - 36:57)
this it wasn&#39;t working and instead of me (36:54 - 37:00)
being like bu build my (36:57 - 37:02)
builds how dare you build what you saw (37:00 - 37:04)
on the internet I was just like cool (37:02 - 37:07)
we&#39;ll we&#39;ll make this work and we&#39;ll go (37:04 - 37:08)
through it like somebody was like all I (37:07 - 37:11)
got is all I got is a regir rock I was (37:08 - 37:13)
like okay I&#39;m assuming your reggi rock (37:11 - 37:15)
is like body press that&#39;s fine um and (37:13 - 37:18)
the first time we did it uh they like (37:15 - 37:22)
tralized rock type um regir rock and (37:18 - 37:25)
they had like a rocky helmet on the (37:22 - 37:28)
regir Rock and I was like this this (37:25 - 37:31)
isn&#39;t working and they&#39;re like well this (37:28 - 37:32)
this is kind of all I have and I was (37:31 - 37:33)
like great I was like just change it to (37:32 - 37:36)
fighting type Tera and get a shell Bell (37:33 - 37:37)
and they&#39;re like oh I don&#39;t have a shell (37:36 - 37:38)
Bell I was like cool you can buy it in (37:37 - 37:39)
lencia or (37:38 - 37:43)
whatever they came back perfect like we (37:39 - 37:45)
just changed two things on their Pokemon (37:43 - 37:47)
just give it a fighting type Tera and (37:45 - 37:50)
give your your regir rock a shell Bell (37:47 - 37:53)
didn&#39;t die didn&#39;t have any problems (37:50 - 37:55)
performed perfectly and it&#39;s it&#39;s so (37:53 - 37:58)
like there is preparation to it (37:55 - 38:02)
mhm but also like if you only have a (37:58 - 38:03)
specific (38:02 - 38:05)
Pokemon there are just like minor (38:03 - 38:08)
changes you can make to make it work (38:05 - 38:10)
like yeah I guess if this person didn&#39;t (38:08 - 38:13)
have 50 fighting Terra shards they&#39;d (38:10 - 38:14)
definitely be in trouble or if they (38:13 - 38:16)
didn&#39;t have 20,000 polka dollars to buy (38:14 - 38:19)
a shell Bell they would be in trouble (38:16 - 38:21)
yeah but also that you have to think (38:19 - 38:24)
about what comes with that is the (38:21 - 38:29)
extensive knowledge that you have in how (38:24 - 38:32)
like the fact that you know you know oh (38:29 - 38:33)
this is what they&#39;re probably going to (38:32 - 38:35)
bring with that reggi rock like this is (38:33 - 38:37)
what you should change it to to do that (38:35 - 38:38)
this is what you should do that like (38:37 - 38:41)
there are a lot of people a lot of (38:38 - 38:43)
people who don&#39;t know Pokemon and know (38:41 - 38:45)
like the moves the abilities what to (38:43 - 38:47)
like weakness to what like in the same (38:45 - 38:49)
way that you do I thought it was a kids (38:47 - 38:50)
game though aren&#39;t they doing that in (38:49 - 38:52)
the playground they&#39;re writing in shock (38:50 - 38:55)
EVs and IVs on the (38:52 - 38:57)
absolutely they&#39;re quizzing each other (38:55 - 39:00)
out of abilities and what water bubble (38:57 - 39:03)
does yeah I mean um and obviously with (39:00 - 39:05)
the internet there&#39;s a lot more um a lot (39:03 - 39:07)
more accessibility to reference all of (39:05 - 39:09)
that and to you know to understand that (39:07 - 39:11)
but I think a lot of people go into (39:09 - 39:14)
these sevenstar raids just wanting to (39:11 - 39:16)
beat them but I don&#39;t know that they&#39;re (39:14 - 39:20)
like that they know enough about their (39:16 - 39:23)
Pokemon to to know that like without (39:20 - 39:24)
someone telling them like oh change it (39:23 - 39:27)
to change it to fighting Tera and then (39:24 - 39:30)
add like shell Bell I don&#39;t even know (39:27 - 39:31)
where I like I don&#39;t even know where I (39:30 - 39:33)
would start to look on the internet if I (39:31 - 39:35)
wanted to try to figure that out like oh (39:33 - 39:38)
I my specific regir rock that I have (39:35 - 39:40)
like you can&#39;t type into Google to make (39:38 - 39:43)
regir rock better work for seven star (39:40 - 39:46)
incinerar like you know like because (39:43 - 39:47)
there&#39;s so little time between these (39:46 - 39:49)
things that if you don&#39;t if you don&#39;t (39:47 - 39:52)
have someone like yourself who like has (39:49 - 39:55)
that knowledge ready to go and to give (39:52 - 39:57)
you like it&#39;s a lot it&#39;s obviously a lot (39:55 - 40:00)
harder to to do something like that so (39:57 - 40:02)
to your point like there is preparation (40:00 - 40:04)
needed for these raids which I also (40:02 - 40:07)
appreciate because you look like a year (40:04 - 40:09)
and a half or two years later and you (40:07 - 40:11)
can just look back at all the like now (40:09 - 40:14)
level 100 Pokemon that you&#39;ve built up (40:11 - 40:15)
and like all these things that you now (40:14 - 40:17)
have for the future right that you&#39;ll be (40:15 - 40:18)
able to take into home and bring to a (40:17 - 40:22)
future game uh which is really cool um (40:18 - 40:24)
but yeah I feel like a lot of people (40:22 - 40:26)
don&#39;t don&#39;t aren&#39;t going to do that (40:24 - 40:27)
preparation and then they&#39;re going to (40:26 - 40:29)
jump in and it&#39;s like if it&#39;s not (40:27 - 40:32)
working out you know where do I go again (40:29 - 40:34)
where do I go to figure out well I have (40:32 - 40:36)
my regir rock and my regir Rock&#39;s my my (40:34 - 40:39)
my only thing and now I have no idea (40:36 - 40:40)
what to do with it to turn it into (40:39 - 40:42)
something that actually works for this (40:40 - 40:44)
without having like a guide without (40:42 - 40:47)
having someone there that already knows (40:44 - 40:49)
what they&#39;re doing which is where you (40:47 - 40:52)
come in but you know like it&#39;s tough (40:49 - 40:54)
otherwise I&#39;m looking forward to the (40:52 - 40:56)
next generation of Pokemon and whatever (40:54 - 40:58)
the gimmick is that everybody&#39;s going to (40:56 - 41:00)
have their their Zumer rils and their (40:58 - 41:04)
iron hands ready to go you know (41:00 - 41:07)
everybody here here here&#39;s my last last (41:04 - 41:11)
last thing about seven star in cinar is (41:07 - 41:14)
is I I you going back going with the (41:11 - 41:18)
like Pokemon is for kids so when I I (41:14 - 41:21)
hate doing sevenstar raids with people (41:18 - 41:24)
because the it it must be the kids that (41:21 - 41:25)
that are bringing the bad counters or (41:24 - 41:28)
are failing this is what I will say I I (41:25 - 41:32)
was a kid once too and when I was when I (41:28 - 41:36)
spoiler when I was when I was 10 (41:32 - 41:40)
112 I would carry around the strategy (41:36 - 41:44)
Guides of Ocarina of Time Final Fantasy (41:40 - 41:47)
9 Pokemon Gold and Silver I would carry (41:44 - 41:49)
these in my backpack these I I would (41:47 - 41:51)
read them every night from start to (41:49 - 41:54)
finish because I had like as a kid I had (41:51 - 41:56)
limited video game time I was only (41:54 - 41:58)
allowed like one or two hours video (41:56 - 41:59)
games at night so it&#39;s like if I can&#39;t (41:58 - 42:00)
play the video game then I&#39;m going to (41:59 - 42:02)
read about the video game I knew what (42:00 - 42:04)
was going to happen to Final Fantasy 9 (42:02 - 42:07)
three discs early because I I read the I (42:04 - 42:10)
read the heck out of that and maybe (42:07 - 42:11)
maybe it was a different time different (42:10 - 42:13)
place because you know strategy guides (42:11 - 42:17)
aren&#39;t very common now but when when I (42:13 - 42:19)
did have my limited internet time I (42:17 - 42:21)
would look up how to do things in games (42:19 - 42:24)
that like I&#39;m stuck in this game and I (42:21 - 42:26)
would I would go to like game FAQs or or (42:24 - 42:29)
game cheats cuz if it was even that hard (42:26 - 42:30)
it was like okay I can at least skip the (42:29 - 42:35)
level with AB y y24 like I&#39;ll just skip (42:30 - 42:38)
the level and move on right I I think (42:35 - 42:43)
that kids are so talented and so much (42:38 - 42:46)
smarter than people give credit for and (42:43 - 42:48)
like when they&#39;re playing fortnite for (42:46 - 42:50)
example which I do think more kids play (42:48 - 42:52)
fortnite than Pokemon it&#39;s not like (42:50 - 42:53)
they&#39;re putting the eight-year-olds in a (42:52 - 42:56)
different Lobby than the 36y old that&#39;s (42:53 - 43:00)
not happening you are losing to a child (42:56 - 43:02)
you just don&#39;t know that there&#39;s a child (43:00 - 43:04)
on the other end of that screen like the (43:02 - 43:06)
person who who killed you in fortnite is (43:04 - 43:09)
not like some 27 well maybe it is a 27y (43:06 - 43:12)
old but not always like some 27y old who (43:09 - 43:14)
is like no lifing fortnite although I&#39;m (43:12 - 43:17)
sure that the case I&#39;ve lost so many (43:14 - 43:18)
battle or rocket league matches to (43:17 - 43:20)
10-year-olds I&#39;m sure of it and they (43:18 - 43:22)
just destroy me and that is that is (43:20 - 43:24)
absolutely fine and don&#39;t for don&#39;t (43:22 - 43:26)
forget that the kids they&#39;re they&#39;re on (43:24 - 43:27)
their phones too while you&#39;re at home on (43:26 - 43:29)
a couch with your Pro Controller you (43:27 - 43:31)
know to (43:29 - 43:35)
that it&#39;s crazy I feel like most of the (43:31 - 43:37)
failures are just (43:35 - 43:40)
adults and I&#39;m going to give you two (43:37 - 43:41)
examples of how I know they&#39;re adults (43:40 - 43:44)
number one is that you as an adult (43:41 - 43:46)
listening to this podcast has have (43:44 - 43:48)
probably gone to Ikea and you have (43:46 - 43:50)
probably purchased an Ikea set of (43:48 - 43:53)
furniture and when you got it home you (43:50 - 43:55)
threw away the instructions and went I (43:53 - 43:58)
don&#39;t need that (43:55 - 44:02)
that&#39;s number one number two is watch (43:58 - 44:05)
any adult try to board an airplane oh (44:02 - 44:10)
true true preach they cannot follow (44:05 - 44:13)
instructions at all even when somebody (44:10 - 44:16)
over the loudspeaker is like everyone (44:13 - 44:19)
stay seated if you are main cabin one (44:16 - 44:22)
please get up and then just people just (44:19 - 44:23)
stand they just get up and stand there (44:22 - 44:26)
in front they just they just don&#39;t (44:23 - 44:28)
follow instructions at all it is (44:26 - 44:31)
mindboggling just go to like anyone (44:28 - 44:33)
who&#39;s like no these are all these are (44:31 - 44:35)
all kids failing no it&#39;s you you you (44:33 - 44:36)
it&#39;s it&#39;s you you&#39;re the problem you&#39;re (44:35 - 44:38)
the person standing in front of (44:36 - 44:39)
everyone&#39;s way at the airport because (44:38 - 44:41)
you&#39;re not listening to instructions no (44:39 - 44:44)
one&#39;s taking your seat 34b is going to (44:41 - 44:45)
be there whether you get on the plane (44:44 - 44:49)
first or last like calm down buddy stop (44:45 - 44:51)
bringing water type Terra Pokemon to (44:49 - 44:54)
incin (44:51 - 44:54)
um all right that&#39;s my rant uh we are (44:58 - 45:02)
going to take a break when we come back (45:01 - 45:04)
uh we&#39;re going to talk about more raid (45:02 - 45:09)
battles but this time in Pokemon go so (45:04 - 45:12)
we will be right back and we are back (45:09 - 45:14)
from our (45:12 - 45:18)
break go big with Dynamax Pokemon and (45:14 - 45:19)
Max raid (45:18 - 45:22)
battles (45:19 - 45:23)
uh (45:22 - 45:28)
so Dynamax is here woo (45:23 - 45:30)
kind of two (45:28 - 45:34)
Pokemon um maxray battles should be (45:30 - 45:36)
happening next (45:34 - 45:39)
week uh and we&#39;re we&#39;re right now we&#39;re (45:36 - 45:42)
in we&#39;re in pregame mode I think the max (45:39 - 45:44)
Raid Battle start on Tuesday Yeah (45:42 - 45:46)
Tuesday the 10th so the day after this (45:44 - 45:47)
comes (45:46 - 45:50)
out um and (45:47 - 45:50)
then uh starting today or by the time (45:50 - 45:55)
this podcast goes up you should be able (45:54 - 45:57)
to purchase (45:55 - 46:00)
Max raid particle PS (45:57 - 46:02)
for (46:00 - 46:05)
$7.99 to according to this blog post by (46:02 - 46:07)
Niantic uh you don&#39;t won&#39;t need to do (46:05 - 46:09)
that if you&#39;ve at least played this past (46:07 - 46:13)
week and maybe well maybe if you live in (46:09 - 46:18)
the middle of nowhere maybe not um (46:13 - 46:21)
but I I have so many thoughts about what (46:18 - 46:24)
is happening right now in Pokemon go and (46:21 - 46:28)
I wish they were more POS (46:24 - 46:33)
positive but I think I don&#39;t know here&#39;s (46:28 - 46:36)
what I will say I I guess I&#39;ll start (46:33 - 46:40)
when they added the new pois points of (46:36 - 46:43)
interest in Pokemon go which are the (46:40 - 46:44)
what what I don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re (46:43 - 46:47)
officially called spots power spots when (46:44 - 46:51)
they added the power spots to the (46:47 - 46:55)
map that in itself was exciting and I (46:51 - 46:58)
think great the fact that it&#39;s been (46:55 - 47:01)
we&#39;ve had Poké stops and gyms for (46:58 - 47:04)
ultimately eight years well I guess (47:01 - 47:08)
seven years no eight years eight years (47:04 - 47:12)
uh like there should have been another (47:08 - 47:15)
POI of something and if you look at like (47:12 - 47:16)
uh what was that Harry Potter game there (47:15 - 47:18)
was like four different (47:16 - 47:22)
pois uh Pikman has I think (47:18 - 47:27)
three anyways um so first off adding a (47:22 - 47:30)
bunch of new pois instantly like I I I (47:27 - 47:32)
was I I wanted to drop everything I was (47:30 - 47:34)
like I want to put my shoes on uh it&#39;s (47:32 - 47:36)
super nice out I want to go walking like (47:34 - 47:38)
I want to leave my house to play Pokemon (47:36 - 47:40)
go which last week if you remember I (47:38 - 47:43)
said I don&#39;t think for me I know for me (47:40 - 47:46)
that adding groi score Bunny and sabble (47:43 - 47:48)
to the game is not enough for me to go (47:46 - 47:50)
outside it&#39;s just not they&#39;ll appear in (47:48 - 47:52)
my house I&#39;ll pin up them I&#39;ll catch (47:50 - 47:54)
what 20 of them in my house with pin (47:52 - 47:55)
apps and then I&#39;ll have enough to have a (47:54 - 47:57)
cinder so (47:55 - 47:59)
whatever Steve apparently lives at the (47:57 - 48:02)
Mall of America he&#39;s getting tons of (47:59 - 48:04)
spawns of Pokemon at his house but what (48:02 - 48:07)
about a Dy on your nearby if you see (48:04 - 48:09)
that are you leaving your house to go (48:07 - 48:12)
get it I mean uh (48:09 - 48:15)
dpy maybe no here&#39;s the thing about (48:12 - 48:17)
Steve here&#39;s the thing about Steve Steve (48:15 - 48:20)
doesn&#39;t catch the things on his nearby (48:17 - 48:22)
because Steve says that he can no longer (48:20 - 48:24)
then see where they are for future (48:22 - 48:27)
refence understood what is the point of (48:24 - 48:30)
then never have the Pokemon right right (48:27 - 48:33)
I&#39;m just waiting to Dy Community Day in (48:30 - 48:36)
in four years yeah then I&#39;ll have them (48:33 - 48:38)
all (48:36 - 48:43)
um so the new pois like that got me to (48:38 - 48:45)
go out I actually went out two days in a (48:43 - 48:48)
row like where I&#39;m like I&#39;m just I&#39;m not (48:45 - 48:49)
even I I&#39;m not even running errands or (48:48 - 48:51)
anything I&#39;m just going out and I&#39;m (48:49 - 48:54)
playing because I I I spun I like did (48:51 - 48:56)
the swirly thing or the tap and hold and (48:54 - 48:58)
they all come together that&#39;s a very (48:56 - 49:00)
Pikmin thing by the way that&#39;s like 100% (48:58 - 49:02)
a mechanic they just took from Pikmin I (49:00 - 49:04)
love it though it feels great yeah no it (49:02 - 49:08)
feels awesome yeah uh and then I got to (49:04 - 49:11)
like you have collected 800 for the day (49:08 - 49:14)
and I was like oh cool like okay that&#39;s (49:11 - 49:16)
great like I did I I was I was only out (49:14 - 49:18)
for here for a half hour it&#39;s saying I&#39;m (49:16 - 49:20)
done for the day I can only get 800 if (49:18 - 49:22)
I&#39;m thinking my head 800 every day (49:20 - 49:25)
that&#39;s a lot of particles that&#39;s (49:22 - 49:28)
fine and then there&#39;s like the what the (49:25 - 49:32)
an extra 200 for walking or whatever 300 (49:28 - 49:34)
it&#39;s it&#39;s 300 for walking 2 kilm I (49:32 - 49:37)
believe yeah and I was like oh that also (49:34 - 49:38)
makes sense like if you don&#39;t if you (49:37 - 49:41)
don&#39;t live in a big city like me and you (49:38 - 49:42)
don&#39;t have a lot of stops you can go to (49:41 - 49:44)
to get the particles you can just (49:42 - 49:46)
literally walk and you can get like what (49:44 - 49:49)
300 right 300 you can just get 300 for (49:46 - 49:53)
walking so even after I completed my 800 (49:49 - 49:55)
particles which was relatively quick (49:53 - 49:58)
quick cuz I again I live in a big City I (49:55 - 49:59)
was like I&#39;m just going to keep walking (49:58 - 50:02)
cuz I want the I want the other 300 and (49:59 - 50:05)
that is where I ran into the first (50:02 - 50:07)
issue which (50:05 - 50:11)
is yes you can only spin eight of those (50:07 - 50:14)
stops or whatever those (50:11 - 50:19)
pois but you can&#39;t go over a (50:14 - 50:19)
th60 technically is what it caps it at (50:20 - 50:25)
for some reason yeah you there&#39;s like a (50:23 - 50:27)
trick where you can get like 1,020 if do (50:25 - 50:30)
it in a certain order but like yes yeah (50:27 - 50:33)
so I was like so my first day with this (50:30 - 50:36)
experience I was really happy I was like (50:33 - 50:39)
new pois I like spinning them 800 a day (50:36 - 50:42)
seems fine that&#39;s weird that I can&#39;t (50:39 - 50:45)
redeem my last 300 and push me over a (50:42 - 50:47)
thousand I didn&#39;t realize until the (50:45 - 50:50)
second day because every spoiler people (50:47 - 50:53)
are mad about this mechanic shocking I (50:50 - 50:56)
didn&#39;t realize that a thousand is just (50:53 - 50:58)
your (50:56 - 51:01)
limit so when I go back out for day two (50:58 - 51:03)
and I&#39;m excited to get my eight Poké (51:01 - 51:05)
stops I&#39;m excited to walk my two (51:03 - 51:09)
kilometers again I can&#39;t do any of that (51:05 - 51:12)
yeah right because I have to spend it so (51:09 - 51:13)
my fir so this is why like I I didn&#39;t (51:12 - 51:15)
want to come on the show and be negative (51:13 - 51:17)
but my first day with this experience (51:15 - 51:19)
was so good because I was like we&#39;re in (51:17 - 51:21)
pregame mode we&#39;re just pregame until (51:19 - 51:23)
next week I&#39;m going to go out every day (51:21 - 51:26)
and get my 800 because I genuinely had a (51:23 - 51:29)
good time going out and getting my 800 (51:26 - 51:30)
thing and I was like I&#39;m get 800 every (51:29 - 51:33)
single day I&#39;m going to be stocked for (51:30 - 51:35)
when Dynamax drops on the (51:33 - 51:40)
10th but there&#39;s this weird a thousand (51:35 - 51:43)
cap and so day two I can&#39;t I can&#39;t spin (51:40 - 51:46)
any of my Dynamax stops I I can walk but (51:43 - 51:49)
I can&#39;t redeem (51:46 - 51:49)
it yeah and and I I think the the (51:49 - 51:54)
question is then just like why don&#39;t you (51:53 - 51:56)
just spend it right have you progressed (51:54 - 51:58)
enough in the research to get your wulu (51:56 - 52:00)
yet yeah so I have two wulu and I have a (51:58 - 52:03)
squet and all three of those Pokemon are (52:00 - 52:04)
two (52:03 - 52:07)
stars so I would be willing to like I (52:04 - 52:09)
did spend it I did spend it for the sake (52:07 - 52:11)
of like I&#39;m going to spend it to then do (52:09 - 52:14)
a little bit more and then also talk (52:11 - 52:16)
about on the show that I spent (52:14 - 52:19)
it (52:16 - 52:22)
but I don&#39;t have anything to spend it on (52:19 - 52:24)
right like I don&#39;t want to right yeah (52:22 - 52:27)
right yeah the general like mind instead (52:24 - 52:30)
of a go player of being like Oh I you (52:27 - 52:32)
know this is a Charmander but it&#39;s like (52:30 - 52:35)
a a 356 like I&#39;m going to hold on to (52:32 - 52:37)
these candies I&#39;ll probably transfer (52:35 - 52:39)
this one I will find a better Charmander (52:37 - 52:41)
eventually and sometimes that doesn&#39;t (52:39 - 52:43)
happen for six months right or whatever (52:41 - 52:44)
doesn&#39;t happen until the Community Day (52:43 - 52:47)
happens right but then you are stuck and (52:44 - 52:49)
ready to go and you cannot do that with (52:47 - 52:52)
this you can&#39;t plan ahead you have to (52:49 - 52:53)
invest in what you have on hand (52:52 - 52:55)
otherwise you just you&#39;re just sitting (52:53 - 52:57)
there at like 10% (52:55 - 52:59)
you know the entire time of what what (52:57 - 53:01)
what it will take at the end of the day (52:59 - 53:05)
right I I I will I will say that I based (53:01 - 53:06)
we don&#39;t we don&#39;t actually know what a (53:05 - 53:08)
Dynamax raid looks like right because (53:06 - 53:11)
we&#39;re recording this before yeah Max (53:08 - 53:12)
battles we (53:11 - 53:15)
don&#39;t so I if Max battles are (53:12 - 53:18)
dramatically (53:15 - 53:22)
different cool if they&#39;re the same there (53:18 - 53:23)
isn&#39;t going to be a difference between a (53:22 - 53:26)
two star Wu and a three star Wu right (53:23 - 53:28)
like just un locking the max move is (53:26 - 53:30)
probably going to be more important than (53:28 - 53:36)
like 10 10 10 verse 12 12 12 I right (53:30 - 53:37)
yeah right (53:36 - 53:40)
um I will say okay so going back to like (53:37 - 53:43)
going out and exploring once I realize (53:40 - 53:44)
the (53:43 - 53:47)
cost so to upgrade a Max move I wish I (53:44 - 53:48)
should have this in front of me it was (53:47 - 53:51)
like what it was like 40 well you have (53:48 - 53:53)
to Candy you have to unlock them first (53:51 - 53:55)
to unlock it in the first level is 400 (53:53 - 53:57)
Max particles and 50 candy mhm and then (53:55 - 53:59)
I which I don&#39;t think is bad yeah and (53:57 - 54:02)
then to upgrade that after that is like (53:59 - 54:04)
quite a bit and then from 2 to three (54:02 - 54:07)
requires like XL candy too so I know a (54:04 - 54:10)
lot of people are getting gated by their (54:07 - 54:12)
their wulu candy not even not even the (54:10 - 54:15)
max stuff at this point in time yes so (54:12 - 54:17)
for Max guard it is (54:15 - 54:22)
450 four 400 particles 50 candy for Max (54:17 - 54:25)
guard level two it is a th000 particles (54:22 - 54:28)
and 150 candy and then for max level (54:25 - 54:32)
three which is the max max level is (54:28 - 54:35)
1,800 which how do you get (54:32 - 54:37)
that how do you get 1,800 if you can (54:35 - 54:39)
only hold a thousand I think that&#39;s (54:37 - 54:41)
total cost (54:39 - 54:44)
right yeah is it yeah it is it is it is (54:41 - 54:46)
because if you if you do spend the 400 (54:44 - 54:48)
to unlock it then when you go to level (54:46 - 54:50)
two it&#39;s only (54:48 - 54:52)
600 so I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve got my wulu at (54:50 - 54:54)
level two for each of its stuff and to (54:52 - 54:56)
get to level three on each of those it&#39;s (54:54 - 54:59)
380 particles and (54:56 - 55:03)
66 um oh sorry no it&#39;s it&#39;s 800 and uh (54:59 - 55:06)
800 particles and 40 XL candy sorry I (55:03 - 55:08)
was looking at how much I had I see I (55:06 - 55:09)
see okay so that actually makes it (55:08 - 55:11)
cheaper than I think it was going to be (55:09 - 55:12)
okay got it yeah it has to be under the (55:11 - 55:14)
Thousand right which would make sense (55:12 - 55:17)
otherwise gosh what are we doing um okay (55:14 - 55:20)
but the 40xl candies is not a small ask (55:17 - 55:24)
from two to three no it really isn&#39;t we (55:20 - 55:26)
also don&#39;t know like how big of a how (55:24 - 55:30)
drastic is two to three true like is (55:26 - 55:33)
three completely necessary right or (55:30 - 55:36)
could you just get with two possibly but (55:33 - 55:38)
I okay so that that process I don&#39;t (55:36 - 55:41)
think is bad either I have so many good (55:38 - 55:43)
things to say but then I think about (55:41 - 55:44)
like the the limit is what bothers me (55:43 - 55:47)
the most (55:44 - 55:49)
so going back to what I said earlier I (55:47 - 55:52)
wasn&#39;t excited to just go out and get (55:49 - 55:55)
groy score bunny sabble partly because (55:52 - 55:58)
like they can&#39;t be shiny (55:55 - 56:00)
there&#39;ll be Community Days for those (55:58 - 56:03)
they&#39;re not going anywhere like those in (56:00 - 56:04)
themselves I&#39;m just not excited to go (56:03 - 56:07)
out but when when the when Niantic was (56:04 - 56:09)
like okay your first Dynamax Pokemon is (56:07 - 56:11)
going to be (56:09 - 56:15)
wulu I was catching every wulu I saw I (56:11 - 56:19)
was actually pining every wulu I saw too (56:15 - 56:22)
because I wanted to then power up that (56:19 - 56:27)
wulu yeah and I even got my like Lop (56:22 - 56:30)
honey out so I can get more XL candy (56:27 - 56:32)
like wow look at you (56:30 - 56:36)
go in my head I in my head I see the (56:32 - 56:38)
vision Niantic wants they&#39;re it&#39;s almost (56:36 - 56:40)
like they&#39;re trying to fix their economy (56:38 - 56:45)
of well we understand that some players (56:40 - 56:46)
don&#39;t even use their candy at all or (56:45 - 56:48)
they don&#39;t know what to use their candy (56:46 - 56:50)
in we here is something you can use your (56:48 - 56:52)
candy in that isn&#39;t just like bringing (56:50 - 56:54)
your Pokemon up to 50 because it doesn&#39;t (56:52 - 56:56)
require Stardust and I think a lot of (56:54 - 57:01)
players don&#39;t want to power up their 98% (56:56 - 57:04)
Charmander because they could get 100% (57:01 - 57:05)
Charmander and I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s (57:04 - 57:07)
the candy that&#39;s the problem I think (57:05 - 57:10)
it&#39;s the Stardust that&#39;s the problem so (57:07 - 57:12)
when I&#39;m looking and I&#39;m like okay this (57:10 - 57:16)
is only 400 to power this up and then (57:12 - 57:18)
the next day it&#39;s going to be 400 and (57:16 - 57:20)
then or 600 and then the final day it&#39;s (57:18 - 57:22)
going to be 1,000 I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s (57:20 - 57:24)
great I&#39;ll just get 800 today I&#39;ll get (57:22 - 57:27)
800 tomorrow I&#39;ll get 800 the after like (57:24 - 57:32)
I have now a reason to go out every day (57:27 - 57:34)
and I had a good time going out and (57:32 - 57:36)
spinning these Max particle stops or (57:34 - 57:39)
whatever and it&#39;s just like another (57:36 - 57:41)
thing that I can go out and do and (57:39 - 57:43)
accomplish but the (57:41 - 57:47)
limit of a thousand ruins that entire (57:43 - 57:49)
thing like everything would be perfect (57:47 - 57:52)
if there wasn&#39;t that limit I would be (57:49 - 57:55)
swimming in Max particles I would be (57:52 - 57:58)
like n I&#39;m willing to buy a pofin from (57:55 - 58:01)
you because I like this mechanic so much (57:58 - 58:04)
yeah but so do you think so you&#39;re (58:01 - 58:05)
saying you think there should be no (58:04 - 58:07)
limit or do you think it should just be (58:05 - 58:08)
a higher (58:07 - 58:11)
limit I think it should be a little bit (58:08 - 58:14)
higher okay cuz so you&#39;re not saying (58:11 - 58:16)
like it should just be Limitless like (58:14 - 58:19)
like Gathering candy or starbust or XL (58:16 - 58:22)
candy at least at least give me the (58:19 - 58:24)
option to buy more at least let me be a (58:22 - 58:27)
hardcore whale player and giving the (58:24 - 58:29)
option to buy more oh buy more (58:27 - 58:32)
storage buy a higher limit or something (58:29 - 58:34)
they might do that that that sounds (58:32 - 58:36)
right (58:34 - 58:38)
actually yeah you probably just gave (58:36 - 58:40)
Niantic a great idea Steve I mean I (58:38 - 58:44)
think 2000 makes more sense because (58:40 - 58:48)
that&#39;s about three days of you going out (58:44 - 58:50)
and playing give or (58:48 - 58:52)
take and then that gives you three days (58:50 - 58:54)
to be like okay what am I going to spend (58:52 - 58:57)
this on whereas like right now the (58:54 - 58:59)
mindset is I&#39;m going out I got my 800 I (58:57 - 59:02)
need to spend it tonight if I want to go (58:59 - 59:04)
out and do it (59:02 - 59:07)
again and I don&#39;t know even like a (59:04 - 59:10)
hardcore player that&#39;s going to be like (59:07 - 59:11)
let&#39;s let&#39;s just say there&#39;s 10 Pokemon (59:10 - 59:14)
you can Dynamax and not two yeah I don&#39;t (59:11 - 59:16)
even know a hardcore player that&#39;s like (59:14 - 59:18)
okay every every day I&#39;m picking (59:16 - 59:20)
different Pokemon to Dynam like to power (59:18 - 59:22)
up like that&#39;s a lot but but think about (59:20 - 59:24)
this for a second so I I agree with you (59:22 - 59:26)
I I do think the limit should be higher (59:24 - 59:28)
I do think it&#39;s kind of weird that like (59:26 - 59:30)
I also think it&#39;s kind of weird (59:28 - 59:32)
that I guess some people love some (59:30 - 59:34)
people hate this you go out and it only (59:32 - 59:36)
takes like if you&#39;re in a big city it (59:34 - 59:39)
takes very small amount of time to like (59:36 - 59:41)
mechanic before you&#39;re done like yeah (59:39 - 59:43)
which is like I feel like Niantic would (59:41 - 59:46)
want you to be out longer like if they (59:43 - 59:48)
can get you to be out longer like so (59:46 - 59:51)
raising that limit would do that because (59:48 - 59:52)
you You&#39; be able to like walk around (59:51 - 59:55)
longer and get to more stops and uh you (59:52 - 59:59)
know spin them or whatever but think (59:55 - 60:00)
about when this you know think about how (59:59 - 60:02)
Dynamax Works in general right Dynamax (60:00 - 60:04)
can be at some point in time will be (60:02 - 60:07)
able to be any Pokemon right as when (60:04 - 60:09)
Niantic eventually rolls everything out (60:07 - 60:11)
as they drip feed this stuff but we all (60:09 - 60:13)
know that like any Pokemon can Dynamax (60:11 - 60:14)
right with how the mechanic Works in (60:13 - 60:18)
sword and shield so except (60:14 - 60:20)
for except okay (60:18 - 60:22)
sure but down the (60:20 - 60:25)
line that you&#39;re going to probably be (60:22 - 60:27)
able to spend those part Les fairly (60:25 - 60:30)
easily once like more stuff rolls out (60:27 - 60:32)
right now we just have wulu and squab it (60:30 - 60:34)
cuz it&#39;s been three days or 5 days of (60:32 - 60:37)
like playing this mechanic and so it&#39;s (60:34 - 60:38)
like yeah what are we going to put it (60:37 - 60:41)
into my my one wulu that I got from or (60:38 - 60:43)
my two Wu that I got from research or my (60:41 - 60:46)
one squet sure that feels like weird and (60:43 - 60:48)
awkward and I don&#39;t know if I want to (60:46 - 60:50)
put that in there but you&#39;re also like (60:48 - 60:52)
this is the you&#39;re learning the mechanic (60:50 - 60:54)
right this is like the how do you use a (60:52 - 60:57)
Pokeball section of the game right like (60:54 - 60:59)
we&#39;re just learning the mechanic and (60:57 - 61:01)
like using it that way that&#39;s why they (60:59 - 61:03)
gave us the Wu Spotlight hour probably (61:01 - 61:05)
right get a bunch of Wu candy get a (61:03 - 61:07)
bunch of excel candy things like that (61:05 - 61:10)
yeah um but I feel like and maybe I&#39;m (61:07 - 61:12)
wrong and I hope I really hope that (61:10 - 61:14)
they&#39;re not going to drip feed Dynamax (61:12 - 61:16)
for the next seven or eight years where (61:14 - 61:20)
like we&#39;re not going to have Dynamax uh (61:16 - 61:24)
like uh Psyduck until 2029 or something (61:20 - 61:27)
like maybe that would be kind of wild (61:24 - 61:29)
but I imagine there will be a time in (61:27 - 61:32)
the not too far off future where we&#39;ll (61:29 - 61:34)
have like a pretty good variety of (61:32 - 61:37)
Pokemon to Dynamax and to add stuff to (61:34 - 61:39)
and I think using those particles on (61:37 - 61:42)
kind of a regular basis may actually not (61:39 - 61:47)
be like as tough and allow you to go and (61:42 - 61:48)
and still be able to do stuff I don&#39;t (61:47 - 61:50)
know I just think like that thousand (61:48 - 61:53)
limit might actually in not too far off (61:50 - 61:55)
in the future might actually not really (61:53 - 61:57)
hurt because you&#39;re just able to put (61:55 - 62:00)
those particles somewhere fairly (61:57 - 62:02)
easily okay so there but there&#39;s two (62:00 - 62:04)
limits right first of all I I definitely (62:02 - 62:06)
agree with the whole like this is an (62:04 - 62:08)
onboarding period right and and should (62:06 - 62:10)
be kind of viewed like that but there&#39;s (62:08 - 62:11)
the 1,000 particle limit but there&#39;s (62:10 - 62:14)
also uh a limit on how many power spots (62:11 - 62:16)
you can collect from a day you can&#39;t (62:14 - 62:17)
like collect them and then spend them (62:16 - 62:20)
then collect more right yeah um so I (62:17 - 62:22)
think that I think that second limit is (62:20 - 62:27)
fine oh really okay I I I I think the (62:22 - 62:29)
you can only collect it&#39;s it&#39;s eight (62:27 - 62:31)
it&#39;s eight power stops you can only go (62:29 - 62:33)
to eight power stops a day and then you (62:31 - 62:36)
can do your two kilometers which (62:33 - 62:38)
together is (62:36 - 62:41)
1,100 I I think if there&#39;s a limit on (62:38 - 62:43)
anything if Niantic needs to limit stuff (62:41 - 62:46)
to preserve their game economy I think (62:43 - 62:48)
that&#39;s fine but I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t (62:46 - 62:51)
think a player who is excited to go out (62:48 - 62:54)
every day to hit these new pois should (62:51 - 62:57)
be punished for l literally going out (62:54 - 62:59)
and playing their game like that is what (62:57 - 63:01)
they want they want us to go out and (62:59 - 63:04)
leave I want I had so much fun the first (63:01 - 63:06)
day and then the second day I was so (63:04 - 63:09)
hyped and I was and I was having fun (63:06 - 63:13)
until I realized oh this a thousand is (63:09 - 63:18)
not per day it&#39;s just all I can hold (63:13 - 63:21)
right yeah I don&#39;t know I I guess I see (63:18 - 63:23)
what you&#39;re saying and I understand and (63:21 - 63:26)
I think that there wouldn&#39;t be a whole (63:23 - 63:28)
lot of trouble with them actually (63:26 - 63:31)
raising that limit so that you know you (63:28 - 63:33)
can at least save up for a couple days (63:31 - 63:35)
like you&#39;re to your point like you know (63:33 - 63:37)
if it was something like 24 2500 maybe (63:35 - 63:39)
like you could go out for three days and (63:37 - 63:42)
like get your stuff and then you have a (63:39 - 63:44)
little bit more potential options like (63:42 - 63:46)
because you maybe when the raids do come (63:44 - 63:48)
out like maybe you&#39;ve done a few of (63:46 - 63:49)
those so now you can kind of pick which (63:48 - 63:51)
one&#39;s your best one you can put that (63:49 - 63:52)
toward that and that gives you more time (63:51 - 63:55)
than like the day of to kind of figure (63:52 - 63:56)
that out but (63:55 - 64:01)
but I really think that again this is on (63:56 - 64:03)
an onboarding process like this is just (64:01 - 64:04)
they&#39;re just like this is how it works (64:03 - 64:06)
right this is why we&#39;re giving you all (64:04 - 64:07)
that stuff this is why we gave you the (64:06 - 64:09)
research which I don&#39;t know about yours (64:07 - 64:12)
but mine Auto completed for me my step (64:09 - 64:15)
two like I didn&#39;t spin 10 power stop (64:12 - 64:18)
power spots and it just like completed (64:15 - 64:20)
the step for me I know some other people (64:18 - 64:22)
in the slack the same thing happened (64:20 - 64:24)
like it just completed step two I didn&#39;t (64:22 - 64:27)
spin a lot of amount to complete that (64:24 - 64:29)
task but I had to I had to work for mine (64:27 - 64:32)
Bobby not me not (64:29 - 64:37)
me but I just feel like I I I feel like (64:32 - 64:40)
those particles will end up getting used (64:37 - 64:43)
more often than you think once more (64:40 - 64:46)
stuff rolls out and even if you&#39;re not (64:43 - 64:48)
like storing it up but you may be able (64:46 - 64:50)
to put it toward you know this or that (64:48 - 64:51)
and then it&#39;ll get used I don&#39;t know I (64:50 - 64:53)
just think it&#39;ll be used more often than (64:51 - 64:55)
than we think as things are rolled out I (64:53 - 64:59)
don&#39;t disagree like if I if I was to go (64:55 - 65:02)
out on let&#39;s just say on Tuesdays (64:59 - 65:06)
Dynamax Bulbasaur Charmander Squirtle (65:02 - 65:08)
appear you could also argue there&#39;s like (65:06 - 65:09)
a limit of like you could do one free (65:08 - 65:11)
rate a day and I&#39;m sure there are people (65:09 - 65:12)
who only do their one free raid a day (65:11 - 65:16)
and don&#39;t give Niantic money and I I (65:12 - 65:18)
more power to that those people you rock (65:16 - 65:21)
uh but like I could imagine doing let&#39;s (65:18 - 65:24)
just say three of each (65:21 - 65:27)
raid and picking one of those three to (65:24 - 65:28)
be like oh this is this is good enough (65:27 - 65:32)
to power up and now I have the next two (65:28 - 65:35)
weeks to be like okay every today I&#39;m (65:32 - 65:37)
going to do Squirtle tomorrow Squirtle (65:35 - 65:38)
the next day Squirtle after that I&#39;m (65:37 - 65:41)
going to switch a Charmander after like (65:38 - 65:42)
now you (65:41 - 65:46)
have exactly what Bobby has said you (65:42 - 65:48)
have a goal and things to spend the (65:46 - 65:50)
particles (65:48 - 65:51)
onh (65:50 - 65:55)
um but then what happens after that like (65:51 - 65:57)
you have five like (65:55 - 66:01)
how fast is this drip feed right well (65:57 - 66:03)
that&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying my this (66:01 - 66:05)
all falls apart if it&#39;s like we are not (66:03 - 66:07)
getting anything else for another six (66:05 - 66:10)
months it&#39;s just the five that we now (66:07 - 66:12)
have you know and there&#39;s nothing else (66:10 - 66:14)
coming then that would be that&#39;s kind of (66:12 - 66:17)
a problem I mean do we know if if going (66:14 - 66:20)
into max battles will require particles (66:17 - 66:23)
to to get in or not oh I don&#39;t know CU (66:20 - 66:25)
if they do that&#39;s another sync um which (66:23 - 66:28)
would make in this model I think did (66:25 - 66:30)
they does does a Dynamax Raad battle (66:28 - 66:33)
take a raid pass I don&#39;t (66:30 - 66:36)
think I you know I who could say one way (66:33 - 66:37)
or the other we&#39;re going to find out on (66:36 - 66:38)
Tuesday there&#39;s been plenty of like (66:37 - 66:39)
information that people are talking (66:38 - 66:41)
about leaked from stuff but as far as (66:39 - 66:43)
official communication goes I don&#39;t (66:41 - 66:45)
think so I don&#39;t think we know the (66:43 - 66:47)
answer to that question yeah there was (66:45 - 66:49)
there was some stuff on the self Road uh (66:47 - 66:51)
which we talk about from time to time (66:49 - 66:54)
but I I didn&#39;t see anything about a a a (66:51 - 66:57)
dollar raid pass being needed I I really (66:54 - 67:00)
hope not and and in in a weird in a (66:57 - 67:03)
weird sort of like uh likening to you (67:00 - 67:04)
had mentioned that it doesn&#39;t cost (67:03 - 67:07)
Stardust for this this system yet either (67:04 - 67:09)
um which I think is good so if they&#39;re (67:07 - 67:11)
able to create because what well some of (67:09 - 67:13)
them okay one of the big complaints I&#39;ve (67:11 - 67:14)
seen online I can tell Chris has a (67:13 - 67:16)
million things to say right now I do one (67:14 - 67:18)
of the things I&#39;ve seen online that (67:16 - 67:20)
people are complaining about they&#39;re (67:18 - 67:23)
just like oh so I I I get a Dynamax (67:20 - 67:26)
Pokemon to then do a Dynamax uh battle (67:23 - 67:28)
to then get more Dynamax Pokemon to do (67:26 - 67:30)
more Dynamax battles right yes and there (67:28 - 67:33)
was even a cheeky response from Pokemon (67:30 - 67:34)
goes like socials where they responded (67:33 - 67:36)
to somebody making that post and they (67:34 - 67:40)
said why yes which is hilarious um but (67:36 - 67:43)
like I I don&#39;t see a problem I I don&#39;t (67:40 - 67:45)
see the problem especially if you&#39;re not (67:43 - 67:47)
stepping on the toes of other resources (67:45 - 67:49)
using other subsystems which is great so (67:47 - 67:52)
no Stardust and hopefully no raid passes (67:49 - 67:53)
if they just use max particles instead (67:52 - 67:56)
as a standin would make more sense that (67:53 - 67:57)
because then you&#39;re not alienating the (67:56 - 67:58)
PVP players right cuz they&#39;re never (67:57 - 67:59)
going to spend their Stardust and (67:58 - 68:02)
anything else besides their Pokemon MH (67:59 - 68:04)
um and the raap passes won&#39;t get in the (68:02 - 68:06)
way of people doing their regular raid (68:04 - 68:08)
stuff yeah I don&#39;t I don&#39;t understand (68:06 - 68:10)
that complaint of like I&#39;m doing Dynamax (68:08 - 68:12)
raids to do more Dynamax raids to get (68:10 - 68:14)
more Dynamax Pokemon to do Dynam that&#39;s (68:12 - 68:16)
what do you what have you been doing for (68:14 - 68:18)
eight years that&#39;s all Pokemon go is (68:16 - 68:20)
you&#39;re only doing something to get more (68:18 - 68:22)
of something it&#39;s more of that which is (68:20 - 68:24)
which is good design I think for this (68:22 - 68:26)
product honestly I mean you can take a (68:24 - 68:27)
10,000 foot View and be like what&#39;s the (68:26 - 68:29)
point of all this oh for sure be (68:27 - 68:31)
reductive about all the things in your (68:29 - 68:33)
life like that please go ahead see how (68:31 - 68:35)
far that gets you no that&#39;s not a good (68:33 - 68:37)
way to look at it (68:35 - 68:39)
like (68:37 - 68:42)
I you know what&#39;s really funny is like I (68:39 - 68:46)
don&#39;t even want a regular shiny wulu I (68:42 - 68:49)
want a Dynamax shiny wulu yeah let&#39;s go (68:46 - 68:52)
yeah am I going to do a million raids (68:49 - 68:56)
for Dynamax shiny wulu no because I (68:52 - 68:58)
well in my head I don&#39;t want to give (68:56 - 69:02)
Niantic raid money but if Dynamax raids (68:58 - 69:06)
are free and they involve just (69:02 - 69:09)
walking and I can go to eight pois a day (69:06 - 69:11)
and I can walk 2 (69:09 - 69:14)
kilometers um to get more particles and (69:11 - 69:16)
I need those to get into Dynamax raids (69:14 - 69:18)
and that&#39;s how I do Dynamax raids I will (69:16 - 69:20)
do more Dynamax raids that sounds like a (69:18 - 69:23)
great loop I think that I I if the (69:20 - 69:26)
future of Pokémon go is hey here&#39;s the (69:23 - 69:29)
thing that you you Boomer Pokemon go (69:26 - 69:31)
players like that you&#39;ve been doing for (69:29 - 69:34)
eight years which is spend a dollar roll (69:31 - 69:38)
for your shiny chance and repeat because (69:34 - 69:40)
that&#39;s ultimately what raids are most (69:38 - 69:42)
people doing raids are doing it one for (69:40 - 69:44)
PVP which is a small percentage of (69:42 - 69:45)
players or two they&#39;re doing it for (69:44 - 69:48)
Shiny chances that is still going to be (69:45 - 69:50)
there that is still going to take your (69:48 - 69:51)
that&#39;s still going to take your money (69:50 - 69:53)
that&#39;s still going to take your Stardust (69:51 - 69:55)
that&#39;s still going to use the Pokemon (69:53 - 69:57)
that you have earned over the last eight (69:55 - 69:59)
years this new mechanic which if you (69:57 - 70:03)
don&#39;t like just ignore you don&#39;t have to (69:59 - 70:06)
participate yep is going to be exploring (70:03 - 70:09)
walking and also for free but we&#39;re not (70:06 - 70:11)
going to dip into that Stardust mechanic (70:09 - 70:13)
but you are kind of starting over but (70:11 - 70:16)
that&#39;s because this is something new and (70:13 - 70:18)
if you don&#39;t like (70:16 - 70:21)
new because you&#39;re a conservative Boomer (70:18 - 70:22)
player which is fine a lot of video game (70:21 - 70:24)
players are very conservative they don&#39;t (70:22 - 70:25)
like their games to change they want (70:24 - 70:28)
things to be exactly the way they are (70:25 - 70:30)
this we&#39;re not taking away anything else (70:28 - 70:32)
that&#39;s all like like nothing with this (70:30 - 70:35)
Dynamax launch is saying your old stuff (70:32 - 70:36)
is going (70:35 - 70:39)
away yeah I if anything this Dynamax (70:36 - 70:42)
launch like it&#39;s so siloed off from (70:39 - 70:44)
everything else to your point if you (70:42 - 70:47)
don&#39;t like this mechanic you can (70:44 - 70:49)
completely ignore it yeah I don&#39;t like (70:47 - 70:51)
GBL and I ignore it you know you don&#39;t (70:49 - 70:52)
have to (70:51 - 70:54)
like Bas (70:52 - 70:57)
dude you you can you know you see those (70:54 - 71:00)
new pois and that&#39;s kind of the extent (70:57 - 71:03)
of it like just just don&#39;t just don&#39;t do (71:00 - 71:04)
it if you don&#39;t like the mechanic and (71:03 - 71:06)
like I get the idea that like well this (71:04 - 71:08)
new mechanic is out and you know I I (71:06 - 71:11)
wish I liked it right or like it&#39;s a new (71:08 - 71:13)
feature that&#39;s now being focused on (71:11 - 71:14)
which means that they&#39;re taking away (71:13 - 71:15)
from focusing (71:14 - 71:18)
on whatever else they could be focusing (71:15 - 71:20)
on because they&#39;re focusing on this (71:18 - 71:22)
right like yeah I mean in to the makes (71:20 - 71:23)
sense to a point right they&#39;re now (71:22 - 71:26)
focusing on this so these other things (71:23 - 71:28)
aren&#39;t getting focused so I understand (71:26 - 71:30)
that it&#39;s like this new feature came out (71:28 - 71:32)
I don&#39;t like it and because it&#39;s new and (71:30 - 71:34)
it&#39;s going to be focused on other things (71:32 - 71:36)
that I wish might happen probably won&#39;t (71:34 - 71:39)
for now right so I understand that but (71:36 - 71:42)
at the end of the day like Steve&#39;s point (71:39 - 71:44)
like I also am not a huge GBL fan so I (71:42 - 71:47)
don&#39;t do it and like if I want to do it (71:44 - 71:48)
sometimes or if there&#39;s a task to do it (71:47 - 71:51)
like sure I do it or I&#39;ll you know I&#39;ll (71:48 - 71:53)
do it when needed but otherwise like I (71:51 - 71:54)
still have fun with the game and I just (71:53 - 71:57)
don&#39;t participate in that aspect of the (71:54 - 71:59)
game and it&#39;s totally (71:57 - 72:02)
fine yeah and I feel like there is (71:59 - 72:04)
literally nothing wrong with being happy (72:02 - 72:06)
for other people enjoying something in (72:04 - 72:08)
the game that you also enjoy because (72:06 - 72:09)
that just means that other people going (72:08 - 72:11)
to be playing the game that you like (72:09 - 72:14)
more which means that it&#39;s going to be (72:11 - 72:16)
you know more popular and then be more (72:14 - 72:18)
developed in the future right so the two (72:16 - 72:20)
of you saying and myself included I also (72:18 - 72:22)
don&#39;t really GBL but like this last GBL (72:20 - 72:26)
update I I&#39;m close friends with many (72:22 - 72:27)
players and they are losing their minds (72:26 - 72:29)
over these changes right and so I&#39;m (72:27 - 72:32)
excited for them that&#39;s incredible um (72:29 - 72:34)
not going to affect my life very much at (72:32 - 72:37)
all no not really but Dynamax might and (72:34 - 72:39)
for those that it doesn&#39;t I hope that (72:37 - 72:41)
they can adopt that view as well just be (72:39 - 72:42)
excited for the rest of us like that (72:41 - 72:44)
like that Meme of Squidward looking (72:42 - 72:46)
outside at SpongeBob and Patrick playe (72:44 - 72:49)
through the window like let us just have (72:46 - 72:52)
our fun like I want a big sheep you know (72:49 - 72:54)
it it&#39;ll be cool yeah I I play with (72:52 - 72:57)
somebody who who always brings up routes (72:54 - 72:59)
they&#39;ll be like oh we got we got we got (72:57 - 73:01)
a we got a party up and we got to do a (72:59 - 73:04)
route like oh I one I forgot about party (73:01 - 73:06)
too I forgot about routes but like every (73:04 - 73:07)
time I play like that is the thing they (73:06 - 73:09)
bring up right away and like they like (73:07 - 73:11)
that and that&#39;s cool and like I&#39;m like (73:09 - 73:14)
yeah for sure like here&#39;s my party and (73:11 - 73:16)
you can pick the tasks you like picking (73:14 - 73:18)
the tasks and you like doing the tasks (73:16 - 73:21)
and um and that&#39;s that&#39;s cool for them (73:18 - 73:25)
like there are like Pokémon go is a (73:21 - 73:27)
relative ly big (73:25 - 73:30)
game with all of these different Avenues (73:27 - 73:31)
you can go (73:30 - 73:34)
down (73:31 - 73:38)
and again my main complaint is the limit (73:34 - 73:41)
the like a thousand limit uh that is my (73:38 - 73:44)
main complaint and that kind of soured (73:41 - 73:46)
me for like Oh I thought I was going to (73:44 - 73:48)
be able to go out every day and kind of (73:46 - 73:50)
like really really pregame this this (73:48 - 73:52)
launch and I can&#39;t and that&#39;s probably (73:50 - 73:56)
intentional Niantic probably doesn&#39;t (73:52 - 73:59)
but like but it but it does fly in the (73:56 - 74:01)
face of of the established play style (73:59 - 74:04)
right like I I agree it definitely feels (74:01 - 74:06)
like it&#39;s at odds is creating friction (74:04 - 74:07)
between the way that we&#39;ve been taught (74:06 - 74:09)
to play this game which is to hoard (74:07 - 74:11)
resources I I would have went out every (74:09 - 74:14)
day and and done my two like I I do go (74:11 - 74:16)
for a daily walk every day that&#39;s why (74:14 - 74:20)
when I do my adventure re uh incense but (74:16 - 74:22)
I don&#39;t think the adventure incense Gets (74:20 - 74:23)
Me 2 kilometers maybe I don&#39;t walk that (74:22 - 74:26)
fast I don&#39;t know but (74:23 - 74:28)
like I remember walking for 20 minutes (74:26 - 74:30)
the first (74:28 - 74:33)
day hitting the8 pois doing my adventure (74:30 - 74:36)
incense and then getting home and being (74:33 - 74:38)
like Oh I have like three to go so I&#39;m (74:36 - 74:39)
just going to go back out and walk (74:38 - 74:42)
around the block and that feels like (74:39 - 74:44)
something Niantic wants a player to do (74:42 - 74:47)
is like yeah walk to finish your (74:44 - 74:50)
things and I did and then I realized (74:47 - 74:52)
like oh I can&#39;t even redeem this because (74:50 - 74:55)
I already (74:52 - 74:55)
the other the other complaint I saw (74:56 - 75:02)
which is not actually a Niantic thing it (74:58 - 75:04)
well it is a Niantic thing but like it&#39;s (75:02 - 75:06)
it&#39;s just a Pokemon thing in general is (75:04 - 75:11)
like I want to Dynamax my 100 IV shiny (75:06 - 75:14)
hat Charmander yeah and I have to now (75:11 - 75:15)
get a new (75:14 - 75:17)
Charmander and that&#39;s just like a very (75:15 - 75:20)
Pokemon thing yeah that&#39;s like when you (75:17 - 75:23)
buy sword and shield and you&#39;re like uh (75:20 - 75:25)
I guess I got to get a new Garchomp and (75:23 - 75:27)
Ivy and Eevee train this gar Cho because (75:25 - 75:29)
I want to use it in competitive and (75:27 - 75:30)
Pokemon home isn&#39;t going to work for six (75:29 - 75:33)
months um that&#39;s just a very Pokemon (75:30 - 75:35)
thing of (75:33 - 75:38)
like they they have done like again I (75:35 - 75:40)
don&#39;t think it&#39;s not a Niantic thing (75:38 - 75:42)
Niantic could fix it I guess and let you (75:40 - 75:44)
Dynamax your Charmander but it is a very (75:42 - 75:46)
Pokemon thing to make you recatch (75:44 - 75:48)
creatures you have been catching for 28 (75:46 - 75:50)
years do you know the amount of times (75:48 - 75:53)
I&#39;ve caught a Poliwag every single game (75:50 - 75:55)
I guess I&#39;m catching this Poliwag I have (75:53 - 75:58)
million pows but I got to catch this pow (75:55 - 75:59)
yeah we do there is you do have to point (75:58 - 76:01)
out though like just cuz this is (75:59 - 76:02)
absolutely going to get brought up in (76:01 - 76:06)
the comments uh that specifically for (76:02 - 76:09)
Dynamax you could bring a Pokemon that (76:06 - 76:11)
you had previously caught in and Dynamax (76:09 - 76:13)
it in sword and (76:11 - 76:16)
shield yes so like because I know (76:13 - 76:18)
somebody&#39;s gonna say like this this (76:16 - 76:20)
specific mechanic you could bring an (76:18 - 76:23)
older gigantamax no gigantamax no until (76:20 - 76:26)
Max soup came out but Dynamax yes you (76:23 - 76:28)
could bring an older but again to your (76:26 - 76:29)
point like that wasn&#39;t until home (76:28 - 76:32)
connectivity happened which the game (76:29 - 76:33)
came out in November home connectivity (76:32 - 76:35)
was in February of the home came out (76:33 - 76:37)
February the following year so yeah (76:35 - 76:38)
there were still three months where you (76:37 - 76:40)
had to play with what you were catching (76:38 - 76:42)
new right you didn&#39;t you couldn&#39;t bring (76:40 - 76:45)
your Pokemon in right away and get it (76:42 - 76:48)
dynamaxed but you know soon after you (76:45 - 76:50)
were able to in sword and shield you (76:48 - 76:52)
were able to bring in old Pokemon and (76:50 - 76:56)
Dynamax them yeah so like that that (76:52 - 76:58)
introduction was not shocking to me (76:56 - 77:00)
that&#39;s what I expected from Niantic (76:58 - 77:02)
especially like technically in X and Y (77:00 - 77:03)
you can Mega Evolve any Pokemon if you (77:02 - 77:06)
just give it the held item and in this (77:03 - 77:08)
game you can only Mega Evolve the things (77:06 - 77:10)
you get for Mega raids which then lets (77:08 - 77:12)
you do more Mega (77:10 - 77:14)
raids which then you catch and then you (77:12 - 77:16)
do more Mega it&#39;s it&#39;s the same oh wait (77:14 - 77:20)
it&#39;s the same Loop crazy yeah (77:16 - 77:20)
huh y yeah I feel like those players (77:22 - 77:28)
that are are complaining or upset rather (77:25 - 77:30)
that they can&#39;t bring in their their (77:28 - 77:33)
100% IV shiny charizard right or (77:30 - 77:35)
whatever the case might be that they&#39;re (77:33 - 77:37)
kind of freed from that to a degree when (77:35 - 77:39)
they realize that this mechanic is (77:37 - 77:40)
almost self-contained I mean as far as (77:39 - 77:44)
we know right um I mean your your 100% (77:40 - 77:47)
IV Max Charizard is going to still have (77:44 - 77:49)
the same amount of use that value and (77:47 - 77:52)
usability has not decayed at all with (77:49 - 77:54)
the introduction of this new feature it (77:52 - 77:56)
is not touched you know (77:54 - 77:59)
so I I get it but at the same time like (77:56 - 78:02)
it could have been a lot worse you know (77:59 - 78:04)
we&#39;re we&#39;re like also in a point with (78:02 - 78:06)
Pokemon go where (78:04 - 78:09)
like not that it needs to be like reset (78:06 - 78:12)
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s (78:09 - 78:15)
possible um and I I I I don&#39;t know there (78:12 - 78:17)
there&#39;s probably an equivalent in like (78:15 - 78:19)
MMOs like Final Fantasy or World of (78:17 - 78:23)
Warcraft where they they do they (78:19 - 78:26)
do kind of do resets or they&#39;ll like (78:23 - 78:29)
rebalance everything stat squishes yeah (78:26 - 78:32)
um but like if I if I look at my top (78:29 - 78:36)
Pokemon I have a level 50 lucky shiny (78:32 - 78:39)
palia I have a level 50 lucky shiny (78:36 - 78:42)
Diaga I have a level 50 lucky shiny dong (78:39 - 78:43)
winds (78:42 - 78:48)
necrozma I got a regular 98% Kyogre I (78:43 - 78:51)
got a lucky shiny 98% (78:48 - 78:56)
Kyogre like just those four Pokémon I I (78:51 - 78:58)
why would I ever do another raid like (78:56 - 79:00)
why would I ever do another Kyogre raid (78:58 - 79:05)
I got I got yeah that&#39;s I agree with (79:00 - 79:06)
that I&#39;ve been using the same because (79:05 - 79:07)
people talk to me about that all the (79:06 - 79:09)
time I&#39;ve been using the (79:07 - 79:14)
same Pokemon for raids for years yeah (79:09 - 79:16)
exactly and like the reason I don&#39;t (79:14 - 79:18)
power things up it&#39;s I don&#39;t need to (79:16 - 79:21)
like I (79:18 - 79:21)
have they&#39;ve recently made some changes (79:21 - 79:26)
though I mean (79:24 - 79:29)
to this but I mean for the sake of this (79:26 - 79:31)
argument I I mean you you two are right (79:29 - 79:34)
but uh it just just in this past like (79:31 - 79:35)
week and a half they did make some (79:34 - 79:37)
changes that changed the DPS tiers and (79:35 - 79:40)
charts but not so dramatically that the (79:37 - 79:42)
same Pokemon that you&#39;re using are going (79:40 - 79:45)
to make a big difference if they are or (79:42 - 79:47)
are not number one and are now number (79:45 - 79:50)
five in the respective DPS tiers right I (79:47 - 79:53)
mean because rating is just like that I (79:50 - 79:56)
did see there was saw somebody somebody (79:53 - 79:58)
in our slack did mention that (79:56 - 80:03)
like Cartana yeah re c one out of the (79:58 - 80:05)
top 15 or something because went out for (80:03 - 80:07)
Cartana so it looks like there were some (80:05 - 80:10)
that were affected but and I will say as (80:07 - 80:13)
someone who used to uh when I used to (80:10 - 80:14)
play a lot more with like a with a (80:13 - 80:17)
specific group I used to work in an area (80:14 - 80:19)
that was a heavy Pokemon go place and so (80:17 - 80:21)
during work during breaks during lunch (80:19 - 80:22)
we would go out and a group of us would (80:21 - 80:25)
go around and raid and stuff and (80:22 - 80:27)
I would get with like the group where we (80:25 - 80:29)
would have the minimum amount of people (80:27 - 80:31)
needed to do a raid and we would try to (80:29 - 80:34)
beat you know um I think at the time (80:31 - 80:35)
there were like four star raids were a (80:34 - 80:38)
thing yeah yeah so we would try to beat (80:35 - 80:40)
the the four yeah this is showing my age (80:38 - 80:44)
here like a queen or something my go it (80:40 - 80:45)
it like it was like Tyranitar for (80:44 - 80:47)
instance like there was a fourstar (80:45 - 80:48)
Tyranitar and we would go in there like (80:47 - 80:51)
me and one other person and minimum you (80:48 - 80:52)
know do what we could to beat the (80:51 - 80:56)
Tyranitar and at that point in time (80:52 - 80:58)
the DPS matters like the making sure (80:56 - 81:00)
you&#39;re leveled to the right level mat (80:58 - 81:02)
like that stuff really does matter right (81:00 - 81:05)
so having the highest IV Pokemon those (81:02 - 81:07)
things really do matter in those times (81:05 - 81:10)
when you&#39;re going in with the minimum (81:07 - 81:11)
amount of people trying to beat those (81:10 - 81:14)
raids um so those things do matter and (81:11 - 81:17)
like to these changes can they can (81:14 - 81:18)
really affect things like that when (81:17 - 81:20)
you&#39;re trying to go in with that minimum (81:18 - 81:23)
am amount of people and do that uh yeah (81:20 - 81:25)
which is not I think a very high percent (81:23 - 81:27)
of the people doing raids where they&#39;re (81:25 - 81:29)
really trying to go in with the minimum (81:27 - 81:31)
amount but I there are people who like (81:29 - 81:35)
don&#39;t have you know a group of 15 or 20 (81:31 - 81:38)
to raid with or can you know get a bunch (81:35 - 81:41)
of people with remote raids or whatever (81:38 - 81:43)
you know so I mean those changes can (81:41 - 81:44)
affect things and you may need to power (81:43 - 81:46)
up other stuff so I understand it on (81:44 - 81:48)
that side um but for me personally like (81:46 - 81:51)
yeah I&#39;m using the same Tyranitar that I (81:48 - 81:52)
caught way back when I caught that (81:51 - 81:56)
four-star Tyranitar in like 2018 or 2019 (81:52 - 81:58)
like still using that one for raids (81:56 - 82:01)
because it works you know I remember (81:58 - 82:04)
yeah when I was in Hawaii and I was live (82:01 - 82:07)
streaming and I was I was I was in some (82:04 - 82:08)
what was what was the what was the (82:07 - 82:11)
legendary raid in oh it was Shadow (82:08 - 82:14)
suun so I was I I jumped into a raid (82:11 - 82:16)
Shadow suun I&#39;m like showing the (82:14 - 82:18)
convention hall I had like 4,000 people (82:16 - 82:20)
watching me on Twitch cuz like the (82:18 - 82:22)
twitch drops or whatever and somebody (82:20 - 82:24)
came in and I and they were like you&#39;re (82:22 - 82:28)
using a Mel medal against a (82:24 - 82:29)
suun and I&#39;m (82:28 - 82:31)
[Music] (82:29 - 82:34)
like like brother there are 20 people in (82:31 - 82:37)
this raid I could be using six Stantler (82:34 - 82:39)
and we would still be able to complete (82:37 - 82:43)
it like what get off your high horse man (82:39 - 82:45)
like none of this (82:43 - 82:47)
matters you got to set an example though (82:45 - 82:50)
Steve come on now I don&#39;t even think I (82:47 - 82:52)
don&#39;t even think the I can&#39;t remember (82:50 - 82:54)
the last time I like looked down at a (82:52 - 82:57)
raid cuz I&#39;m just I&#39;m just tapping and (82:54 - 82:59)
chitchatting with people I still I&#39;ve (82:57 - 83:01)
never dodged I&#39;ve never dodged in a raid (82:59 - 83:05)
ever o wow that is I I still like (83:01 - 83:08)
building out the teams and stuff so like (83:05 - 83:10)
if I know a Pokemon that I&#39;m going to be (83:08 - 83:15)
raing a lot is coming I do like to pick (83:10 - 83:18)
out like team build a team you know set (83:15 - 83:20)
up a team so it&#39;s like preset you know (83:18 - 83:22)
when I go there I like I like doing that (83:20 - 83:24)
like cuz I do the thing I like about (83:22 - 83:25)
battling (83:24 - 83:29)
is building the team that I&#39;m battling (83:25 - 83:30)
with and I know that goes against the (83:29 - 83:32)
fact that I use the same Pokemon as you (83:30 - 83:34)
know five years ago for rating but I (83:32 - 83:37)
actually do have a variety quite a (83:34 - 83:39)
variety of Pokemon that I did power up a (83:37 - 83:42)
long time ago for raiding so like I do (83:39 - 83:45)
like switching in and out those teams um (83:42 - 83:46)
every once in a while I will power up (83:45 - 83:49)
something new but it&#39;s few and far (83:46 - 83:51)
between um but I do like building that (83:49 - 83:52)
up for raids I&#39;m not the person that (83:51 - 83:55)
goes in with whatever random team gives (83:52 - 83:57)
me don&#39;t even look at my screen and just (83:55 - 84:00)
tap as the raid goes on like that&#39;s fine (83:57 - 84:02)
but I go with the random team it gives (84:00 - 84:05)
me minus I will Mega Evolve the (84:02 - 84:07)
appropriate counter put that in my first (84:05 - 84:09)
slot and then I will put my buddy in the (84:07 - 84:11)
sixth slot to get my points and that&#39;s (84:09 - 84:15)
already more than 99% of people put in (84:11 - 84:17)
honestly um I mean and I and I think (84:15 - 84:19)
rates need to be like that they need to (84:17 - 84:21)
be almost autopilot because in a (84:19 - 84:22)
scenario where you&#39;re rating with 20 (84:21 - 84:26)
people um in the intended way right um (84:22 - 84:28)
which is like a a few remotes maybe but (84:26 - 84:29)
like most of the time like you&#39;re hoping (84:28 - 84:31)
that those 20 people are together in a (84:29 - 84:32)
group doing a community event like you (84:31 - 84:35)
want them to be socializing you don&#39;t (84:32 - 84:36)
want them to like be silent staring at (84:35 - 84:38)
their phone like trying to time their (84:36 - 84:41)
Dodges yeah like yeah Focus talk to me (84:38 - 84:43)
right now I&#39;m trying to dodge exactly I (84:41 - 84:45)
mean like think think about our Central (84:43 - 84:46)
Park in New York this year right that&#39;s (84:45 - 84:49)
a perfect example we had like uh groups (84:46 - 84:50)
that were just like like breaking off (84:49 - 84:52)
into subgroups oh we only have 13 in (84:50 - 84:54)
this one and now we have 20 in this one (84:52 - 84:56)
or oh there&#39;s strangers popping in and (84:54 - 84:58)
out and we got 10 for this raid it (84:56 - 85:01)
doesn&#39;t make a huge difference I mean it (84:58 - 85:02)
does a little bit in how much time it (85:01 - 85:05)
takes to complete it but the gamepl is (85:02 - 85:07)
the same and it allows you to (85:05 - 85:10)
socialize which is the other huge part (85:07 - 85:11)
of this game that we&#39;re not even like I (85:10 - 85:14)
guess accounting for right now I I kind (85:11 - 85:16)
of for like that&#39;s funny that you say it (85:14 - 85:17)
because at this point in time I do so (85:16 - 85:19)
many remote raids that like socializing (85:17 - 85:21)
while doing raid is like foreign to me (85:19 - 85:24)
at this point could be but so funny (85:21 - 85:25)
story uh back when I played in that with (85:24 - 85:29)
that big group at work we were out at a (85:25 - 85:33)
raid and this uh this this older person (85:29 - 85:34)
had just parked her car kind of like (85:33 - 85:36)
right in front of us and we were (85:34 - 85:37)
standing on the sidewalk there were (85:36 - 85:39)
maybe about six of us raiding and we (85:37 - 85:41)
were just we all had our phones out (85:39 - 85:42)
because we were raing but we were just (85:41 - 85:43)
having a conversation we&#39;re talking (85:42 - 85:45)
about how work&#39;s been going that day we (85:43 - 85:47)
were actually just we were just (85:45 - 85:49)
socializing we just happened to have our (85:47 - 85:50)
phones (85:49 - 85:53)
out this person just starts yelling at (85:50 - 85:57)
us for being on our phones and how our (85:53 - 86:00)
generation is doomed because all we do (85:57 - 86:03)
is stare at our phones meanwhile none of (86:00 - 86:04)
us are actually staring at our phones (86:03 - 86:06)
because it&#39;s a raid so we&#39;re just (86:04 - 86:07)
tapping our phones while we&#39;re all (86:06 - 86:09)
talking to each other and (86:07 - 86:11)
socializing and she just starts yelling (86:09 - 86:12)
at us basically for like being on our (86:11 - 86:15)
phones all the time and then like (86:12 - 86:17)
proceeds to walk away and just yelling (86:15 - 86:20)
As She&#39;s Walking Away at whatever she (86:17 - 86:21)
probably doesn&#39;t follow the airport (86:20 - 86:24)
instructions NOP no turn signals so (86:21 - 86:26)
nothing but it was interesting to bring (86:24 - 86:28)
that back to the fact that it&#39;s like (86:26 - 86:30)
you&#39;re right like we weren&#39;t focusing on (86:28 - 86:32)
the raid we were all just tapping our (86:30 - 86:35)
phones and actually having a (86:32 - 86:36)
conversation with each other actually (86:35 - 86:39)
socializing and like having a good time (86:36 - 86:41)
together and the raid didn&#39;t at the end (86:39 - 86:42)
we were all like cool okay now let&#39;s all (86:41 - 86:44)
check and see who got the shiny you know (86:42 - 86:47)
like and yeah but during the raid it was (86:44 - 86:49)
like no we all got to talk and hang out (86:47 - 86:52)
and especially with remote raids like I (86:49 - 86:55)
forget that that exists yeah I mean it (86:52 - 86:56)
does exist just in a different way like (86:55 - 86:58)
there are Discord chats or Facebook (86:56 - 87:00)
group chats and stuff like that but (86:58 - 87:02)
absolutely it&#39;s not designed with that (87:00 - 87:04)
in mind it&#39;s designed with like 12 (87:02 - 87:07)
people in a park in a circle in mind you (87:04 - 87:10)
know yep for sure Chris did you like go (87:07 - 87:14)
out do the pois all that all that stuff (87:10 - 87:18)
I did yeah 100% um and my my wulu is is (87:14 - 87:21)
rank two across the board um happy to (87:18 - 87:25)
say nice um but yeah I I also had the (87:21 - 87:27)
same pain point that you had where like (87:25 - 87:30)
I hit that first limit I was like oh (87:27 - 87:34)
shucks this this stinks um but the pois (87:30 - 87:37)
have been plentiful like I I was really (87:34 - 87:40)
surprised at how many there were around (87:37 - 87:42)
here and I mean like I I am relatively (87:40 - 87:45)
blessed there is a a big local community (87:42 - 87:48)
um in like our square area I live in (87:45 - 87:52)
Woodstock uh Illinois so there&#39;s a huge (87:48 - 87:54)
like burgeoning Pokémon go community and (87:52 - 87:56)
built it up with pois but I wasn&#39;t (87:54 - 87:57)
expecting that to also translate to (87:56 - 87:59)
these other power spots and even in dead (87:57 - 88:02)
places where there are not lots of stops (87:59 - 88:04)
I&#39;m seeing plenty of power (88:02 - 88:06)
spots there&#39;s I I think we T we touched (88:04 - 88:09)
on it a little bit but there is (88:06 - 88:12)
something about opening the Pokemon go (88:09 - 88:14)
map and seeing everything that was there (88:12 - 88:19)
but then seeing more yes yep like as far (88:14 - 88:22)
as I know and and and uh Chris and I (88:19 - 88:23)
both talked to Niantic and they said (88:22 - 88:25)
they were not removing any pois but (88:23 - 88:29)
instead all of the Dynamax spots will be (88:25 - 88:32)
new pois well not really new they&#39;ve (88:29 - 88:34)
always been in the game they just used (88:32 - 88:37)
for other games additional now (88:34 - 88:39)
shown so like for (88:37 - 88:43)
example I submitted three things through (88:39 - 88:46)
Wayfair and they all got rejected and I (88:43 - 88:49)
was like oh no you didn&#39;t I antic I know (88:46 - 88:51)
these are all good I know these are all (88:49 - 88:54)
good eligible pois and then when I to (88:51 - 88:57)
see why they got rejected it was because (88:54 - 88:58)
they were already submitted by other (88:57 - 89:01)
people so they were duplicates but they (88:58 - 89:03)
this was like like a year ago and it&#39;s (89:01 - 89:04)
like okay (89:03 - 89:07)
well they don&#39;t exist that&#39;s why I made (89:04 - 89:10)
them they&#39;re not here they don&#39;t (89:07 - 89:13)
exist and now that Dynamax is here they (89:10 - 89:14)
got turned (89:13 - 89:17)
into the max particle things Y and (89:14 - 89:20)
that&#39;s what they are now so (89:17 - 89:24)
yep um so I I that is that is like a (89:20 - 89:27)
plus like I I I have I think a lot of (89:24 - 89:30)
people have gripes with the Dynamax (89:27 - 89:32)
stuff whether that&#39;s the limit whether (89:30 - 89:34)
that&#39;s like needing to catch new Pokemon (89:32 - 89:36)
whether that&#39;s like they they live in (89:34 - 89:38)
the middle of nowhere and they won&#39;t (89:36 - 89:39)
have anyone to raid with when this (89:38 - 89:42)
happens because the pois are supposed to (89:39 - 89:46)
turn into the Dynamax raid (89:42 - 89:48)
battles for my understanding that&#39;s also (89:46 - 89:51)
my understanding yeah yeah is it (89:48 - 89:53)
everyone do we not know that or like (89:51 - 89:54)
it&#39;s just a few like someone of them (89:53 - 89:56)
will be like some of Will and then I (89:54 - 89:58)
think they&#39;re supposed to rotate every 3 (89:56 - 90:00)
days or something well the nature of the (89:58 - 90:01)
spots right now is like how they have a (90:00 - 90:03)
timer and this is confusing for some (90:01 - 90:04)
people that haven&#39;t read through all the (90:03 - 90:06)
blogs even if you have it&#39;s kind of (90:04 - 90:08)
confusing the timer on the power spots (90:06 - 90:10)
is just for how long that one is active (90:08 - 90:13)
and then after that it could move yeah (90:10 - 90:15)
yeah that was a surprise to me when I (90:13 - 90:18)
went out the first day did my walk got (90:15 - 90:20)
my power spots and then woke up the (90:18 - 90:22)
second day opened the game and was like (90:20 - 90:25)
wait that power spot moved like that was (90:22 - 90:29)
there and over there and then it took a (90:25 - 90:30)
it took a while I think it took like (90:29 - 90:32)
someone saying something before I (90:30 - 90:35)
realized that the time on the PO spot (90:32 - 90:38)
section was like the time it&#39;s GNA go (90:35 - 90:41)
away yeah yeah it I was did did not (90:38 - 90:43)
occur to me at all I was like I have no (90:41 - 90:48)
idea like what this is and it&#39;s mostly (90:43 - 90:50)
probably because I didn&#39;t read something (90:48 - 90:53)
but I I was just like oh that make and (90:50 - 90:55)
then it was like okay makes sense okay (90:53 - 90:58)
so now I know I have this time before (90:55 - 91:00)
that&#39;s going to move um and that&#39;s fine (90:58 - 91:03)
uh and again this speaks to uh what (91:00 - 91:04)
Steve was talking about the frustration (91:03 - 91:05)
about having that maximum not being able (91:04 - 91:07)
to hoard resources when we see a timer (91:05 - 91:10)
on a POI what have we been trained to (91:07 - 91:13)
understand that means this entire time (91:10 - 91:15)
and it&#39;s been like that&#39;s a countdown to (91:13 - 91:17)
something happening like oh this is an (91:15 - 91:19)
active or this is going to be a Max (91:17 - 91:22)
battle in like a day and a half or (91:19 - 91:25)
whatever the timer might show right yeah (91:22 - 91:27)
it it it&#39;s going to take some adjustment (91:25 - 91:30)
but yeah I I think next week will go (91:27 - 91:34)
better um yeah I like if you&#39;re a casual (91:30 - 91:36)
player this is probably not a concern (91:34 - 91:38)
because you probably got your a thousand (91:36 - 91:39)
and you&#39;re like sitting on it and (91:38 - 91:41)
waiting if you&#39;re like a hardcore player (91:39 - 91:43)
like me and you&#39;re like I wanted to go (91:41 - 91:44)

they just announced (92:16 - 92:19)
events uh I&#39;m just going to run through (92:17 - 92:21)
the event calendar here uh from (92:19 - 92:23)
September 21st through 22nd will be (92:21 - 92:28)
Pokemon go City Safari in Jakarta which (92:23 - 92:31)
is in Indonesia um and that&#39;s part of (92:28 - 92:33)
Pikachu&#39;s Indonesia journey I don&#39;t he&#39;s (92:31 - 92:35)

yeah uh I will be attending Jakarta uh I (92:43 - 92:48)
don&#39;t think my contract with Niantic is (92:46 - 92:50)
finalized I&#39;m just disclosing that (92:48 - 92:53)
Niantic offered my flight and hotel for (92:50 - 92:57)
Jakarta um and hopefully they&#39;d send a (92:53 - 92:59)
contract so I can sign it cuz they told (92:57 - 93:01)
me to book my flight in a hotel and then (92:59 - 93:04)
they would pay me (93:01 - 93:04)
back so if the event is good it means (93:04 - 93:08)
they paid for it if the event is bad it (93:07 - 93:11)
means I paid for it that&#39;s right that&#39;s (93:08 - 93:14)
that&#39;s the disclosure part uh I&#39;ve never (93:11 - 93:16)
been to Indonesia I don&#39;t know a lot (93:14 - 93:19)
about Indonesia I&#39;m excited to learn I (93:16 - 93:22)
watched a couple YouTube videos and then (93:19 - 93:26)
I realized that like (93:22 - 93:26)
you would think that making travel maybe (93:26 - 93:31)
I&#39;m finding the wrong travel videos but (93:29 - 93:33)
like I was like looking for like first (93:31 - 93:36)
time in Indonesia and it (93:33 - 93:39)
was it was people&#39;s first time in (93:36 - 93:41)
Indonesia but it wasn&#39;t like helpful not (93:39 - 93:44)
helpful like I want like okay if it&#39;s (93:41 - 93:46)
your first time going this is like the (93:44 - 93:48)
public transportation you should be (93:46 - 93:49)
looking at these are the apps you should (93:48 - 93:51)
be downloading these are like the areas (93:49 - 93:53)
you should be staying in like a (93:51 - 93:55)
beginner&#39;s guide you should yeah YouTube (93:53 - 93:59)
search for like fifth time to Indonesia (93:55 - 94:01)
and then see how that person travels (93:59 - 94:03)
around (94:01 - 94:07)
Indonesia um after Jakarta uh September (94:03 - 94:10)
27th through 29th is Pokemon go Safari (94:07 - 94:13)
Zone not to be confused with City Safari (94:10 - 94:18)
that&#39;s an Inon Inon is in South Korea um (94:13 - 94:21)
that&#39;s Friday September 22nd 27th to (94:18 - 94:24)
Sunday September 29th so that&#39;s a 3-day (94:21 - 94:27)
event that is going to be in uh sdo (94:24 - 94:30)
Central Park uh inan is like the biggest (94:27 - 94:32)
airport in South Korea so most people (94:30 - 94:35)
when you fly to like Soul you are flying (94:32 - 94:37)
into inchon and then you&#39;re taking the (94:35 - 94:38)
the train into (94:37 - 94:44)
Soul uh so because I will already be in (94:38 - 94:49)
Jakarta and I have to pass through Korea (94:44 - 94:52)
to get back home I am going to go to (94:49 - 94:55)
inhan nice nice nice (94:52 - 94:58)
nice that&#39;s on my own dime unless (94:55 - 95:00)
Niantic would like to help (94:58 - 95:03)
out in hint wink (95:00 - 95:07)
wink let you all know it&#39;s not there (95:03 - 95:08)
they&#39;ve announced a lot of events for (95:07 - 95:11)
the end of the year which is unusual I (95:08 - 95:13)
think usually we don&#39;t get these kind of (95:11 - 95:15)
events ah we got that Ultra Beast event (95:13 - 95:18)
that one time in November yeah it wasn&#39;t (95:15 - 95:20)
that good but it was an event hey hey it (95:18 - 95:24)
was it it was what it was (95:20 - 95:27)
they announced a brand new (95:24 - 95:29)
experience uh which they&#39;re saying those (95:27 - 95:30)
are their words get ready for a brand (95:29 - 95:32)
new Pokémon go Adventure in November uh (95:30 - 95:36)
Pokemon go wild area in (95:32 - 95:40)
Fukuoka um and then after that the so (95:36 - 95:42)
that&#39;s November 16th through 17th and (95:40 - 95:44)
then for everyone else November 23rd (95:42 - 95:48)
through 24th will be a global wild (95:44 - 95:50)
area uh we&#39;re going to circle back to (95:48 - 95:52)
that in just a second and then they (95:50 - 95:53)
announced two more events I think these (95:52 - 95:55)
are the rest of the events for the year (95:53 - 95:58)
Pokemon go City Safari which is the same (95:55 - 96:01)
as the Jakarta one in Hong Kong that&#39;s (95:58 - 96:03)
December 7th through 8th and then (96:01 - 96:07)
Pokemon go City Safari sa Paulo in (96:03 - 96:10)
Brazil and that is also I I think I said (96:07 - 96:12)
that wrong December 7th through 8th so (96:10 - 96:14)
those are the same weekends one in (96:12 - 96:19)
Brazil one in China interesting um Hong (96:14 - 96:21)
Kong (96:19 - 96:24)
yeah I&#39;ve Hong Kong is on my list of (96:21 - 96:26)
cities to go to Hong Kong looks like I (96:24 - 96:28)
love Hong Kong a real cool City I went (96:26 - 96:30)
to Hong Kong uh on my honeymoon we went (96:28 - 96:32)
to Hong Kong and Japan because my wife (96:30 - 96:35)
is my wife is from or lived in Tokyo for (96:32 - 96:37)
many years so we went um but we went to (96:35 - 96:41)
Hong Kong first uh and then Tokyo so fun (96:37 - 96:44)
fun place for sure great place um okay (96:41 - 96:49)
so going back to a brand new event it&#39;s (96:44 - 96:51)
already confusing that there&#39;s City (96:49 - 96:54)
Safari and Safari Zone (96:51 - 96:56)
and go (96:54 - 96:58)
tour which is what the Americas have (96:56 - 97:02)
been getting yep and now there&#39;s wild (96:58 - 97:05)
area which if you have not played sword (97:02 - 97:07)
and shield yeah the wild area in sword (97:05 - 97:10)
and shield is where you find the dynamx (97:07 - 97:14)
and the gigantamax raids yep so I don&#39;t (97:10 - 97:16)
know how different a wild area would be (97:14 - 97:20)
from a safari zone or from a safari zone (97:16 - 97:21)
because apparently this is going to be (97:20 - 97:25)
taking place in a park not the city (97:21 - 97:27)
yeah (97:25 - 97:31)
and my guess is November 16th and 17th (97:27 - 97:34)
is they&#39;re going to debut the first (97:31 - 97:35)
gigantamax (97:34 - 97:38)
Pokemon and then that gigantamax Pokemon (97:35 - 97:40)
will go to (97:38 - 97:44)
everyone the 23rd and the 24th yeah no (97:40 - 97:45)
that makes sense I that would make sense (97:44 - 97:48)
I don&#39;t see it being similar to a Safari (97:45 - 97:50)
Zone in the sense that a safari zone has (97:48 - 97:52)
never been a global (97:50 - 97:55)
event so the fact that this has a global (97:52 - 97:58)
event aspect to it makes it almost feel (97:55 - 98:01)
like it&#39;s I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s a go (97:58 - 98:04)
Fest but it almost feels like a winter (98:01 - 98:07)
go Fest or like a fall like end of fall (98:04 - 98:09)
type of like because you got the (98:07 - 98:11)
wherever it&#39;s going to be in person or (98:09 - 98:12)
we know going to be in person in Japan (98:11 - 98:16)
um yeah and then um and then the global (98:12 - 98:18)
one a week later it just it gives off (98:16 - 98:19)
more of that Vibe than it does like a (98:18 - 98:21)
safari zone because we&#39;ve again we&#39;ve (98:19 - 98:23)
never had a global Safari Zone or a (98:21 - 98:24)
global any of these other things we&#39;ve (98:23 - 98:26)
never had a GL we had a global we have (98:24 - 98:28)
had go tour the tour the tours are (98:26 - 98:33)
Global as well um okay so maybe okay let (98:28 - 98:36)
me back that up more like a go tour than (98:33 - 98:42)
a uh than a Safari Zone in my (98:36 - 98:44)
mind but what does that what does that (98:42 - 98:46)
mean gameplay-wise though I feel like (98:44 - 98:49)
that&#39;s the big question right well yeah (98:46 - 98:50)
I mean the fact that they&#39;re calling it (98:49 - 98:53)
a wild area to Steve&#39;s Point seems you (98:50 - 98:55)
know gigantamax introduction would make (98:53 - 98:59)
a lot of sense um I also feel like (98:55 - 99:00)
depending on how many more G gallerian (98:59 - 99:02)
Pokemon we have I feel like there&#39;ll be (99:00 - 99:05)
more gallerian Pokemon spawns because (99:02 - 99:08)
just wild area obviously refers to sword (99:05 - 99:11)
and Shield&#39;s wild area true so yeah I (99:08 - 99:12)
feel like they would be kind of heavy (99:11 - 99:15)
maybe heavier on Galler for those couple (99:12 - 99:20)
of days um which it might not be in a (99:15 - 99:22)
park it just says join thousands of (99:20 - 99:25)
trainers in the beautiful city fuku fuku (99:22 - 99:29)
Fukuoka Fukuoka Japan 16th and 17th and (99:25 - 99:30)
participate wherever you are in the (99:29 - 99:33)
world 23rd and 24th so maybe maybe it is (99:30 - 99:36)
the whole city but the picture is a big (99:33 - 99:39)
wild area the picture looks like I mean (99:36 - 99:41)
it&#39;s obviously not a picture of it&#39;s (99:39 - 99:43)
just the background for the image but (99:41 - 99:45)
I&#39;m just saying like um when they do (99:43 - 99:49)
their uh if you look at the events right (99:45 - 99:52)
um isn&#39;t aren&#39;t the backgrounds for the (99:49 - 99:54)
like the images (99:52 - 99:55)
specific (99:54 - 99:58)
to maybe I&#39;m looking at this in wrong (99:55 - 100:00)
but like Safari zones yes the the (99:58 - 100:03)
pictures behind are specific to the area (100:00 - 100:06)
yeah (100:03 - 100:08)
so like City Safari is the picture it&#39;s (100:06 - 100:10)
like the city right it&#39;s called a city (100:08 - 100:12)
Safari but like Safari Zone and the (100:10 - 100:14)
Safari zones typically happen in Parks (100:12 - 100:17)
right yes yes safari zone is Park City (100:14 - 100:20)
Safari is anywhere in the city city so I (100:17 - 100:23)
don&#39;t know the way that this all comes (100:20 - 100:24)
together kind of makes makes it feel (100:23 - 100:25)
like it&#39;s going to be more of a park (100:24 - 100:29)
experience for the in-person one to me (100:25 - 100:33)
uh and then you know Global is global (100:29 - 100:37)
so yeah I (100:33 - 100:37)
uh (100:39 - 100:45)
I I I think it is crazy in 2024 we are (100:41 - 100:49)
announcing a new in-person (100:45 - 100:51)
experience that is not a safari zone or (100:49 - 100:55)
not a safari sa City (100:51 - 100:57)
Safari that is something else because (100:55 - 101:00)
how again like how do you the main (100:57 - 101:01)
difference between City Safari and (101:00 - 101:03)
safari zone is just one is a park one is (101:01 - 101:06)
in a city otherwise they&#39;re kind they&#39;re (101:03 - 101:08)
pretty much the same yeah and it made (101:06 - 101:10)
sense right because those are those are (101:08 - 101:12)
to like promotional outlets for them to (101:10 - 101:14)
do or to Target markets in areas where (101:12 - 101:16)
they&#39;re not ready to do like a go tour (101:14 - 101:18)
or a go Fest like I think from a (101:16 - 101:20)
business standpoint it made a lot of (101:18 - 101:22)
sense this I just like okay well if it&#39;s (101:20 - 101:24)
not a city or if it&#39;s not a park (101:22 - 101:26)
or if it&#39;s both then is this then (101:24 - 101:30)
another middle step between those type (101:26 - 101:33)
of events and a go tour or go Fest right (101:30 - 101:34)
because I felt like go tour was that (101:33 - 101:39)
already like I mean yeah to an extent I (101:34 - 101:41)
I guess my question is does this become (101:39 - 101:44)
something that becomes a regular thing (101:41 - 101:45)
because it says you know uh ready for a (101:44 - 101:47)
brand new Pokemon go Adventure this (101:45 - 101:49)
November but does that mean that this is (101:47 - 101:51)
going to become we&#39;re going to have a (101:49 - 101:54)
wild area every year or or are they (101:51 - 101:56)
really just leaning into Galler right (101:54 - 101:58)
now and this is just a specific event (101:56 - 102:01)
that&#39;s specific introduce one gigantimax (101:58 - 102:05)
Pokemon a year per the wild area God no (102:01 - 102:08)
please no no I do not need to wait till (102:05 - 102:12)
2030 for Gigantic Max Kingler like uh (102:08 - 102:16)
but um I I do Wonder like if this is (102:12 - 102:18)
just leaning into Galler with the max (102:16 - 102:21)
out season and that we&#39;re not going to (102:18 - 102:24)
get another wild area or or maybe we (102:21 - 102:26)
will a couple of them but like that it (102:24 - 102:28)
will then not be something like where (102:26 - 102:33)
we&#39;re Safari zones we&#39;ve had since 20 (102:28 - 102:35)
was it 20 was it the first go Fest where (102:33 - 102:36)
Safari zones were Al were also (102:35 - 102:39)
introduced or was it the second go Fest (102:36 - 102:40)
uh Safari zones were like the year (102:39 - 102:44)
before Co okay so we had Safari zones (102:40 - 102:46)
for five years now like are we G to have (102:44 - 102:50)
wild areas for five years I don&#39;t (102:46 - 102:53)
know I I think the very at the very (102:50 - 102:54)
least they&#39;re doing a good job at going (102:53 - 102:56)
other places like when you see like (102:54 - 102:59)
complaints of like ah why why does Japan (102:56 - 103:00)
get (102:59 - 103:02)
everything like America&#39;s gotten the Go (103:00 - 103:05)
tours non-stop America&#39;s like guaranteed (103:02 - 103:08)
a go Fest every year if anything like (103:05 - 103:11)
Europe and (103:08 - 103:11)
them I don&#39;t they still get a lot of (103:11 - 103:14)
stuff too like they got Madrid they got (103:13 - 103:16)
Barcelona they got multiple things in (103:14 - 103:18)
Germany they got London what like two (103:16 - 103:21)
years in a row I think South America is (103:18 - 103:23)
like where their new Focus has been too (103:21 - 103:25)
to and Mexico has gotten like the (103:23 - 103:29)
one-off events a lot I mean they got two (103:25 - 103:30)
three events I think Mexico has gotten (103:29 - 103:34)
so far um I feel like APAC is really the (103:30 - 103:36)
the last spot I mean besides besides The (103:34 - 103:39)
Usual Suspects and I mean like Australia (103:36 - 103:41)
is is so deserving and that&#39;s where (103:39 - 103:42)
we&#39;re seeing it now but all the other (103:41 - 103:44)
places basically all the other (103:42 - 103:45)
continents that people were you used to (103:44 - 103:47)
complain about have now had a track (103:45 - 103:51)
record of a few years of events you know (103:47 - 103:52)
yeah just Australia and New Zealand are (103:51 - 103:54)
like kind of like the ones left like you (103:52 - 103:57)
said yeah well (103:54 - 104:02)
Africa true yeah I don&#39;t I mean I&#39;m (103:57 - 104:03)
assuming they&#39;re going where the player (104:02 - 104:05)
base is (104:03 - 104:08)
sure um well they did try to do the one (104:05 - 104:10)
not it&#39;s not Africa it&#39;s Middle East but (104:08 - 104:11)
they did try to do the one in Saudi (104:10 - 104:13)
Arabia that got (104:11 - 104:17)
cancelled right right (104:13 - 104:20)
um but Singapore&#39;s had an event Taiwan (104:17 - 104:22)
has had an event because I think there (104:20 - 104:24)
was one in taip okay did Egypt have an (104:22 - 104:28)
event or am I making that up no (104:24 - 104:30)
zig they just (104:28 - 104:34)
got Zig yeah there we go (104:30 - 104:36)
yeah um but yeah this is this (104:34 - 104:39)
is that Brazil event they talked about (104:36 - 104:43)
at what games come MH and now it&#39;s like (104:39 - 104:44)
finalized (104:43 - 104:49)
so it&#39;s cool uh I I would I I am (104:44 - 104:50)
surprised at the amount of events for (104:49 - 104:53)
the rest of the year and if they&#39;ve (104:50 - 104:55)
really ramped up these events I&#39;m (104:53 - 104:56)
curious of how many events will be (104:55 - 104:58)
happening next year like are there going (104:56 - 104:59)
to be more Safari zones are there going (104:58 - 105:00)
to be more City safaris are there going (104:59 - 105:04)
to be more wild areas like are we going (105:00 - 105:06)
to get a Unova go tour because that (105:04 - 105:09)
would be next in line (105:06 - 105:11)
um are we going to get four locations (105:09 - 105:14)
for go Fest instead of three locations (105:11 - 105:18)
like once Niantic gets to an (105:14 - 105:19)
area like (105:18 - 105:21)
Indonesia then they can keep doing (105:19 - 105:23)
events (105:21 - 105:25)
like this is like their fourth Indonesia (105:23 - 105:30)
event I think at this point um so that&#39;s (105:25 - 105:33)
good good good for Brazil good for (105:30 - 105:35)
China (105:33 - 105:38)
um Japan and us have kind of already (105:35 - 105:40)
been safe so you we&#39;re just at this (105:38 - 105:42)
point really like I don&#39;t but to be fair (105:40 - 105:44)
I don&#39;t know how big the Australian (105:42 - 105:46)
Market is I mean big enough for them to (105:44 - 105:51)
have had a regionals for GBL that&#39;s true (105:46 - 105:54)
um and uh enough for me to hear about it (105:51 - 105:56)
all the (105:54 - 105:59)
time I mean I I I personally have (105:56 - 106:01)
several Australian friends obviously so (105:59 - 106:03)
that that that kind of makes it a little (106:01 - 106:06)
biased but well it&#39;s over to I feel they (106:03 - 106:08)
always get everything they always get (106:06 - 106:10)
everything first first and then so they (106:08 - 106:12)
deal with all the no but I mean like so (106:10 - 106:14)
when there&#39;s a problem they&#39;re the ones (106:12 - 106:16)
that have to they take the brunt of it (106:14 - 106:17)
so I feel like that in itself is (106:16 - 106:21)
deserving of them getting some 100% (106:17 - 106:24)
events yeah (106:21 - 106:24)
but at the end of the day nitic (106:26 - 106:31)
knows the percentage of players in these (106:28 - 106:33)
areas of course yeah yeah they have all (106:31 - 106:35)
the data like we we know that like us (106:33 - 106:38)
and Japan are number one and two and I&#39;m (106:35 - 106:40)
sure that flips between player size and (106:38 - 106:44)
money depending on events or whatnot (106:40 - 106:46)
yeah also the US is just significantly (106:44 - 106:47)
bigger than (106:46 - 106:50)
Jaan just a little bit just a little bit (106:47 - 106:54)
Yeah te B (106:50 - 106:57)
uh and we knew Germany was up there as a (106:54 - 106:58)
big player base that&#39;s why there were so (106:57 - 107:01)
many go fests in Germany initially I (106:58 - 107:03)
think Brazil also has a ginormous player (107:01 - 107:07)
base yeah I well I I don&#39;t think it was (107:03 - 107:10)
initially at first right but then it (107:07 - 107:13)
like it like jumped when they added (107:10 - 107:15)
because Portuguese wasn&#39;t in the game (107:13 - 107:17)
right initially I think Portuguese came (107:15 - 107:20)
like two to three years afterwards mhm (107:17 - 107:21)
and then it like skyrocketed once (107:20 - 107:25)
Portuguese got added right (107:21 - 107:25)
um uh some stuff from last week uh we (107:25 - 107:32)
talked about the hot air arena for the (107:28 - 107:36)
TCG and how that related to Pokemon Za (107:32 - 107:39)
uh poke Beach updated their website uh (107:36 - 107:41)
after we recorded the episode apparently (107:39 - 107:42)
there was a (107:41 - 107:45)
mistranslation uh so hot air arena is (107:42 - 107:47)
actually being changed to (107:45 - 107:51)
Heatwave uh so it is Heatwave arena is (107:47 - 107:53)
the appropriate translation so kind of (107:51 - 107:57)
throws a wrench in the whole anime (107:53 - 107:59)
collaboration but it doesn&#39;t changed too (107:57 - 108:02)
much besides that still going to have a (107:59 - 108:04)
Charizard in that set I think yeah take (108:02 - 108:08)
away from that still probably safe for (108:04 - 108:12)
Charizard there um yeah Pokemon Center (108:08 - 108:15)
ngoya oh uh before we hop into that can (108:12 - 108:16)
I say another TCG thing real quick oh (108:15 - 108:19)
yeah yeah yeah totally so um we have (108:16 - 108:23)
Stellar Crown releasing uh this Friday (108:19 - 108:26)
so September 13th uh but what I forgot (108:23 - 108:29)
to mention last week is um pre-releases (108:26 - 108:33)
have started for Stellar Crown so if you (108:29 - 108:36)
like playing the TCG uh or if you uh (108:33 - 108:39)
want to check out the new set prior to (108:36 - 108:42)
Friday um you can look up on the Pokemon (108:39 - 108:44)
website I think if you go to the play (108:42 - 108:47)
Pokemon website under the TCG section (108:44 - 108:48)
you should be able to find an event (108:47 - 108:51)
locator type in your zip code and it (108:48 - 108:54)
will show you all the local card shops (108:51 - 108:57)
all the local places near you that are (108:54 - 108:59)
that do events do poke play Pokemon (108:57 - 109:01)
events and they will show you if they&#39;re (108:59 - 109:03)
doing a pre-release so the way a (109:01 - 109:05)
pre-release works is you go you sign up (109:03 - 109:08)
it&#39;s typically about 30 bucks and you (109:05 - 109:11)
get a build-in battle box which will (109:08 - 109:14)
come with uh like a preconstructed 40 (109:11 - 109:18)
card deck and then four extra packs of (109:14 - 109:20)
whatever set the pre-release is for so (109:18 - 109:22)
this time it will be for Stellar Crown (109:20 - 109:24)
um so you get four packs of that and (109:22 - 109:25)
then what you do is after you sign up (109:24 - 109:27)
you go in and you actually play a little (109:25 - 109:29)
tournament with everyone else who signed (109:27 - 109:32)
up you use that 40 card preconstructed (109:29 - 109:35)
deck and you play a little tournament so (109:32 - 109:36)
um if you&#39;re into playing the game if (109:35 - 109:38)
you want to get some new cards a few (109:36 - 109:41)
days early uh just go to the um play (109:38 - 109:43)

what&#39;s super playable but from a (109:58 - 110:03)
collecting standpoint collector (110:00 - 110:06)
standpoint um they are now introducing (110:03 - 110:10)
the stellar teras and so they have like (110:06 - 110:13)
these rainbow type cards that look (110:10 - 110:16)
really really cool uh but not rainbow (110:13 - 110:18)
rares they&#39;re not rainbow rares like (110:16 - 110:19)

a smaller set as well even though it&#39;s (110:57 - 111:01)
not a special set it does have booster (110:59 - 111:03)
boxes it has individual booster packs (111:01 - 111:05)
but uh it&#39;s actually a little bit of a (111:03 - 111:07)
smaller set than what we&#39;ve had uh this (111:05 - 111:10)
past year so that&#39;s kind of nice (111:07 - 111:13)

lover they have a venette phone case (114:59 - 115:06)
actually hold hold the phone (115:02 - 115:06)
literally uh I don&#39;t know the quality of (115:06 - 115:11)
these phone cases I I have not met (115:08 - 115:13)
anyone who has had a Skinny Dip phone (115:11 - 115:15)
case so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know if (115:13 - 115:17)
like I don&#39;t know what the drop (115:15 - 115:18)
protection is I don&#39;t know how thick (115:17 - 115:20)
they are I don&#39;t know if the image wears (115:18 - 115:23)
off after 6 months like I don&#39;t know (115:20 - 115:25)
yeah they seem like they are rubber (115:23 - 115:27)
cases maybe based (115:25 - 115:30)
on just based on the look of the case (115:27 - 115:33)
looks like silic or something silicone (115:30 - 115:36)
yeah um I&#39;m sure they&#39;re they&#39;re (115:33 - 115:38)
probably just they&#39;re probably Equitable (115:36 - 115:41)
to uh uh what you would probably get (115:38 - 115:45)
like online like a $20 like transparent (115:41 - 115:47)
case except these are 50 because of the (115:45 - 115:50)
PO yeah Pokemon Tex but I&#39;m just like (115:47 - 115:52)
we&#39;re talking like just just looking at (115:50 - 115:55)
it kind of looks like it be similar yeah (115:52 - 115:57)
I&#39;m looking at like the um details of (115:55 - 115:59)
the case it does look like they have the (115:57 - 116:01)
anti-shock bumper Corners you can kind (115:59 - 116:02)
of tell from the case it looks like (116:01 - 116:04)
they&#39;re a little bit nice bulkier there (116:02 - 116:06)
raised edges for protecting the screen (116:04 - 116:08)
face they&#39;re scratch resistant they are (116:06 - 116:09)
drop (116:08 - 116:12)
tested who knows what that means but (116:09 - 116:14)
they are drop tested for for the Pokemon (116:12 - 116:17)
Center stuff it looks like they only (116:14 - 116:19)
have the iPhones but if you go to skinny (116:17 - 116:21)
de&#39;s website they do have Android uh you (116:19 - 116:23)
got to scroll all the way down but they (116:21 - 116:28)
have that&#39;s they weird that Pokemon took (116:23 - 116:31)
the just that&#39;s how Japan too if you (116:28 - 116:33)
ever gone to a Pokemon Center in Japan (116:31 - 116:37)
it&#39;s like all iPhone cases it&#39;s they had (116:33 - 116:38)
I&#39;m I&#39;m assuming they just sell (116:37 - 116:42)
better probably it&#39;s also like narrowed (116:38 - 116:45)
down right to a like iPhone versus the (116:42 - 116:46)
many different I mean there are (116:45 - 116:49)
obviously Android winners right where (116:46 - 116:53)
people mostly have this or that but um (116:49 - 116:55)
yeah maybe they just s better making a (116:53 - 116:57)
definitive comprehensive collection for (116:55 - 116:59)
an iPhone is much simpler than for (116:57 - 117:02)
Android yeah (116:59 - 117:04)
yeah (117:02 - 117:06)
interesting H I don&#39;t know what Android (117:04 - 117:09)
phone case this is (117:06 - 117:12)
looking it just says Android no it&#39;s (117:09 - 117:13)
yeah if you click on it it does say uh (117:12 - 117:16)
latest range of Android cases online for (117:13 - 117:20)
our Pokemon collection from Samsung s24 (117:16 - 117:24)
Ultra to Samsung 23 plus it looks like (117:20 - 117:26)
oh they have a bunch if you hit the drop (117:24 - 117:28)
down menu menu it goes Google pixel 3 (117:26 - 117:31)
all the way up to Google pixel 6 oh yeah (117:28 - 117:33)
look at that look at a lot of all the (117:31 - 117:33)
Samsung (117:33 - 117:35)
[Music] (117:33 - 117:37)
Galaxies but I think that&#39;s again why (117:35 - 117:39)
you see iPhones in store because you (117:37 - 117:41)
don&#39;t have to stock a million models you (117:39 - 117:44)
just have to stock yeah like the last (117:41 - 117:46)
two years of recent it is kind of (117:44 - 117:47)
interesting that they only go to the (117:46 - 117:50)
Google 6 they just released the pixel 9 (117:47 - 117:53)
right so that&#39;s a few years that is a (117:50 - 117:56)
few years back for for that but they go (117:53 - 117:59)
all the way to the s24 for Galaxy (117:56 - 118:02)
so yeah so it looks like the pixel the (117:59 - 118:04)
