interview very probably the most Pokemon (2:44 - 2:46)
interview then then okay so did you just (2:46 - 2:50)
leave out the most important part about (2:50 - 2:51)
him completely maybe maybe he's part of (2:51 - 2:55)
the upright citizens brigade what whoa (2:55 - 2:58)
okay I was a huge fan of Chegwin (2:58 - 3:02)
back in the day and I Wow chink penguin (3:02 - 3:06)

mm-hmm (3:21 - 3:23)
no no I well that's your your homework (3:23 - 3:28)
for the week kiddies (3:28 - 3:29)
look up up rights to the citizens (3:29 - 3:31)
brigade in qiangren unless I'm like (3:31 - 3:33)
completely confusing the guerrilla used (3:33 - 3:36)
to do Chegwin but I just sort of his (3:36 - 3:40)
thing on UCB comedy and yeah he's there (3:40 - 3:43)
so I mean I don't know I can't back you (3:43 - 3:45)
up about the ching one who knows Hey (3:45 - 3:48)
look I have no stakes and Cheng ones but (3:48 - 3:51)
I don't know where I was going with it (3:51 - 3:54)
shows a disaster now before we get into (3:54 - 3:57)
news before we go down our Pokemon (3:57 - 3:59)
bandwagon of happiness has anything new (3:59 - 4:03)
or exciting been happening in your lives (4:03 - 4:05)
that could waste 10 minutes and or I (4:05 - 4:08)
could talk about c2e2 (4:08 - 4:10)
or some other things I feel like I have (4:10 - 4:13)
a lot to say but I do like to give this (4:13 - 4:15)
time to you guys just in case there's (4:15 - 4:17)
like what burritos or something we need (4:17 - 4:18)
to talk about I haven't had any wet (4:18 - 4:21)
burritos I've stopped going to the gym (4:21 - 4:22)
I've started working longer hours at (4:22 - 4:25)
work and I'm plowing through bleach when (4:25 - 4:28)
I am the TV show oh okay I was gonna say (4:28 - 4:31)
you're just just chugging bleach just (4:31 - 4:34)
have it we figured out that you actually (4:34 - 4:37)
don't have to work out you just have to (4:37 - 4:38)
consume tons of bleach yeah and exactly (4:38 - 4:41)
it later no way goes calories yeah brain (4:41 - 4:44)
space I do this don't do not (4:44 - 4:46)
drink oh no don't drink bleach do not (4:46 - 4:49)
judge you will be impressed that I use (4:49 - 4:51)
bleach to clean my bathroom today (4:51 - 4:52)
but yeah now I bleached the TV show (4:52 - 4:55)
about the Soul Reapers and the spirit (4:55 - 4:58)
society and all that good is is bleach (4:58 - 5:00)
better than Digimon I already know the (5:00 - 5:04)
answers no well I mean it depends on (5:04 - 5:08)
what you're looking for bleach is really (5:08 - 5:11)
oriented towards that high school (5:11 - 5:12)
teenager crowd just like Hana may in (5:12 - 5:15)
general Kaname (5:15 - 5:16)
yeah you mean anime yeah the Hana may I (5:16 - 5:20)
mean Kaname for my preference I would (5:20 - 5:22)
choose bleach over Digimon but that's (5:22 - 5:26)
that's me I mean I like the the huge (5:26 - 5:29)
battles the big explosions the awesome (5:29 - 5:32)
power demonstrations which I mean you (5:32 - 5:35)
can I to get in the Digimon Digimon (5:35 - 5:39)
but you don't have a guy who's likely (5:39 - 5:41)
you killed my grandfather and I'm gonna (5:41 - 5:44)
pull this spirit arrow and shoot it (5:44 - 5:47)
through you and destroy you know half (5:47 - 5:49)
the city in doing so that kind of stuff (5:49 - 5:51)
do you wait there's there's way more (5:51 - 5:53)
cuteness and rolling in Digimon and (5:53 - 5:55)
that's true in it we're not we're (5:55 - 5:57)
talking about animes not video games Oh (5:57 - 5:59)
so these those criteria are only for (5:59 - 6:01)
video games yeah I know you know I love (6:01 - 6:04)
Death Note there is no cute there's no (6:04 - 6:06)
roll there's Jose I tried to get my mom (6:06 - 6:09)
to watch Death Note and she was like (6:09 - 6:11)
this is really dark (6:11 - 6:12)
I was like yes that's why it's good (6:12 - 6:14)
mm-hmm what I want to get back to a (6:14 - 6:17)
Digimon here but when I was at c2e2 (6:17 - 6:19)
let's tie this all together there was a (6:19 - 6:21)
lot of different anime all over the (6:21 - 6:22)
place I Irene is really into URI on ice (6:22 - 6:26)
have you guys seen that show no all (6:26 - 6:29)
right sounds very funny it's about me uh (6:29 - 6:31)
like a taters (6:31 - 6:32)
yeah and she's into the show called (6:32 - 6:36)
fresh snow uh it's about swimmers and (6:36 - 6:40)
free free yeah yes that's the Hana May I (6:40 - 6:44)
was thinking of okay it's not spelled (6:44 - 6:46)
with an H Hana me no but some of us are (6:46 - 6:52)
cultured we'll and we know the proper (6:52 - 6:54)
fancy yeah you're you're confusing it (6:54 - 6:57)
with (6:57 - 6:58)
thing that does start with H which I'm (6:58 - 6:59)
not going to speak of on this family (6:59 - 7:02)
oriented program but c2e2 is really (7:02 - 7:06)
great like I said lots of Hannam a lots (7:06 - 7:08)
of pokémon stuff this year there is a (7:08 - 7:12)
minute video on on our Facebook page (7:12 - 7:15)
facebook.com slash pkmn cast if you want (7:15 - 7:17)
to see some of the official and a lot of (7:17 - 7:21)
a lot of non official Pokemon stuff (7:21 - 7:24)
there's a really there's a couple derpy (7:24 - 7:26)
Pikachu's I found that were real (7:26 - 7:28)
heartwarming really little tease really (7:28 - 7:32)
good show this year though I got a a not (7:32 - 7:35)
not a good spot they put me on Sunday (7:35 - 7:37)
last show of the day on Sunday not I'm (7:37 - 7:40)
not the best spot in the world probably (7:40 - 7:42)
actually some would say the worst spot (7:42 - 7:44)
on a panel because most people are (7:44 - 7:46)
buying stuff and or going home on Sunday (7:46 - 7:48)
worse then opposite the Game of Thrones (7:48 - 7:51)
panel mmm I would still I would rather (7:51 - 7:55)
take a earlier spot in the day and (7:55 - 7:59)
compete with the Game of Thrones panel (7:59 - 8:02)
than to be the last spot of the day and (8:02 - 8:05)
compete with people wanting to just go (8:05 - 8:08)
home I think I mean yeah I don't think (8:08 - 8:11)
there's a ton of people that don't have (8:11 - 8:14)
an obvious choice for whether they're (8:14 - 8:16)
going to the Game of Thrones or the (8:16 - 8:18)
Pokemon thing you know like you're not (8:18 - 8:20)
gonna have a 8 year old showed up for (8:20 - 8:22)
the Game of Thrones panel all right well (8:22 - 8:28)
you are probably true but now the whole (8:28 - 8:31)
convention was actually really great I (8:31 - 8:33)
wouldn't say I've been sour on c2e2 but (8:33 - 8:36)
I've been going for you know seven years (8:36 - 8:38)
and the I can remember the first three (8:38 - 8:40)
years they were super fantastic and then (8:40 - 8:42)
you know four five and six I just felt (8:42 - 8:45)
like oh these are kind of the same (8:45 - 8:46)
vendors same thing not anything so (8:46 - 8:50)
exciting to the point where last year I (8:50 - 8:52)
think I was only on the show floor for (8:52 - 8:53)
an hour and a half and then we left (8:53 - 8:55)
after the panel where this year I was on (8:55 - 8:58)
the show floor for almost five hours and (8:58 - 9:00)
I felt like I could have been on the (9:00 - 9:02)
show floor for like another two hours (9:02 - 9:04)
and see more stuff there was a lot of (9:04 - 9:06)
new vendors even though it was in the (9:06 - 9:08)
same space same hall like same size (9:08 - 9:09)
there's just I don't know like different (9:09 - 9:11)
more things to see so it was really (9:11 - 9:14)
enjoyable this year there was about a (9:14 - 9:15)
hundred and thirty people that came out (9:15 - 9:17)
to the panel (9:17 - 9:18)
according to c2e2 so now not the biggest (9:18 - 9:21)
crowd I've pulled but still I just like (9:21 - 9:23)
this little gameshow mechanic which seem (9:23 - 9:25)
to go over really really well so I might (9:25 - 9:26)
do that in the future probably need a (9:26 - 9:28)
better way of calling on people though (9:28 - 9:30)
because there was a lot of uh a lot of (9:30 - 9:33)
hands going up and very hard to hear (9:33 - 9:35)
people so I'll probably have to rework (9:35 - 9:37)
that mechanic but overall I think the (9:37 - 9:39)
show on well there's a cut 30-minute (9:39 - 9:41)
version of it on on the feed so last (9:41 - 9:45)
week if you didn't see that but yeah (9:45 - 9:47)
whoo that was an all right show I mean (9:47 - 9:49)
the biggest problem was c2e2 is it's in (9:49 - 9:51)
Chicago if it was in any other town it (9:51 - 9:53)
would probably be much better what's (9:53 - 9:57)
wrong with Chicago (9:57 - 9:58)
there's played Alysha yeah and I wasn't (9:58 - 10:01)
impressed the one time I went I mean I (10:01 - 10:03)
had a nice time but not necessarily call (10:03 - 10:06)
my name to come on back there mmm got (10:06 - 10:09)
yells more my biggest thing about (10:09 - 10:10)
Chicago was like there's like right (10:10 - 10:13)
right now if I look out any of the (10:13 - 10:15)
windows of my house right now all I see (10:15 - 10:17)
is green leaves on trees I don't see any (10:17 - 10:20)
other buildings I don't see right that's (10:20 - 10:23)
all I see is leaves and stuff I don't (10:23 - 10:25)
think there's a single place in all of (10:25 - 10:27)
Chicago where if you don't look out your (10:27 - 10:28)
window you're not looking into somebody (10:28 - 10:30)
else's window it's all buildings and (10:30 - 10:32)
they're all buildings that are all next (10:32 - 10:34)
to each other and there's like one blade (10:34 - 10:36)
of grass somewhere in a glass case (10:36 - 10:38)
they're like oh yeah we got green I got (10:38 - 10:42)

speaking of getting the green we got (10:44 - 10:47)

the contest advertised on Facebook so it (15:22 - 15:23)
must be real yeah yeah no I'm talking (15:23 - 15:25)
about the next article uh-huh is it on (15:25 - 15:29)
Pokemon podcast comm no that's that's (15:29 - 15:32)
where I get all my Pokemon days yeah (15:32 - 15:33)
yeah yeah (15:33 - 15:34)
this is posting our slack community I'll (15:34 - 15:36)
just read the title here we'll go from (15:36 - 15:38)
there blogger Russian soul soul gaskey (15:38 - 15:42)
faces 3.5 years in prison for playing (15:42 - 15:46)
Pokemon go in a church Oh what do I read (15:46 - 15:51)
the article or do we move (15:51 - 15:53)
but I mean it sounds legitimate knowing (15:53 - 15:55)
how Russia is these days that's true me (15:55 - 15:59)
that's all so it's it's an article where (15:59 - 16:01)
clearly the headline is pretty much the (16:01 - 16:04)
whole it's like a trailer that shows you (16:04 - 16:05)
every plot point in the movie like (16:05 - 16:07)
everybody knows what that article is now (16:07 - 16:10)
that you've read the headline I hope (16:10 - 16:12)
I'll apologize for my butchering of (16:12 - 16:14)
Russian last names here mmm (16:14 - 16:16)
but Russian blogger Ruslan Sol scoffs (16:16 - 16:20)
key might be sentenced to 3.5 years in (16:20 - 16:23)
prison for playing Pokemon go in at (16:23 - 16:24)
church an act that was offensive to (16:24 - 16:27)
religious believers argued the (16:27 - 16:28)
persecution quote I may be an idiot by a (16:28 - 16:32)
but I am by no means an extremist end (16:32 - 16:34)
quote said school scoffs key in his (16:34 - 16:38)
final statement (16:38 - 16:39)
boy what a quote that's good quote again (16:39 - 16:43)
a long time ago people were in (16:43 - 16:46)
imprisoned in camps and for longer terms (16:46 - 16:49)
not for 3.5 years but for decades (16:49 - 16:51)
because they joked for example about (16:51 - 16:54)
communism and about Stalin now it turns (16:54 - 16:56)
out that they want to imprison me for (16:56 - 16:58)
3.5 years in real terms because I (16:58 - 17:00)
obscenely joked about the Orthodox and (17:00 - 17:02)
the hand arc krill for me this is (17:02 - 17:06)
savagery and barbarism I do not (17:06 - 17:08)
understand how this is at all possible (17:08 - 17:10)
nevertheless as we seen it is quite (17:10 - 17:13)
possible indeed end quote schools gas (17:13 - 17:16)
ski is being accused of three offenses (17:16 - 17:18)
based on three articles of Russian (17:18 - 17:20)
criminal criminal code on inciting (17:20 - 17:22)
hatred or M&E offending religious (17:22 - 17:25)
believers and illegally bringing (17:25 - 17:26)
equipment for covert filming the blogger (17:26 - 17:30)
pleaded innocent to all three charges it (17:30 - 17:32)
seems like maybe the Pokemon go wasn't (17:32 - 17:36)
like the chief thing he did wrong here (17:36 - 17:39)
no it was I don't think so either I (17:39 - 17:42)
think it was the fact that he had a (17:42 - 17:44)
phone yeah was the problem yeah I'll (17:44 - 17:48)
skip some paragraphs here the final (17:48 - 17:50)
paragraph when scoffs key was search (17:50 - 17:52)
authorities also found that he was (17:52 - 17:53)
carrying a pen with a built-in camera (17:53 - 17:55)
during the trial the bloggers insisted (17:55 - 17:57)
that the pen does not belong to him he (17:57 - 17:59)
also stressed that the pen is equipted (17:59 - 18:01)
with a light bulb and not a camera which (18:01 - 18:03)
would make the device impossible for (18:03 - 18:05)
culverts shooting (18:05 - 18:07)
so visiting film I so part of this that (18:07 - 18:11)
we also left out I mean let me give you (18:11 - 18:14)
a Part A and A Part B Part A is in (18:14 - 18:17)
Russia the church the Orthodox Church is (18:17 - 18:21)
much more closely tied to the government (18:21 - 18:23)
and much more protected than we would (18:23 - 18:26)
have that here in the States and they (18:26 - 18:29)
have a lot of influence on the (18:29 - 18:30)
government and other people have been (18:30 - 18:32)
arrested and imprisoned for speaking out (18:32 - 18:35)
against the church in Russia as I also (18:35 - 18:39)
to give you a part a dot to one I don't (18:39 - 18:43)
know I have to drive past the Russian (18:43 - 18:45)
embassy to get to work every day so (18:45 - 18:47)
anytime anything happens in Russia I (18:47 - 18:50)
have to drive through that protest I (18:50 - 18:51)
wish you people would stop or like a (18:51 - 18:54)
different block because it slows down my (18:54 - 18:56)
commute to and from work every time (18:56 - 18:58)
Part B the dude is in activist atheist (18:58 - 19:02)
it appears at least some people are (19:02 - 19:04)
reporting it that way so it's kind of (19:04 - 19:06)
like he was possibly speaking out (19:06 - 19:08)
against the Orthodox Church and just (19:08 - 19:10)
using pokeymon go as the sort of you (19:10 - 19:15)
think it was coming where like I wasn't (19:15 - 19:17)
filming I was just playing Pokemon go (19:17 - 19:20)
right yeah I think Pokemon go is at best (19:20 - 19:23)
a bit player in this poem I go is the (19:23 - 19:26)
bait that we took to report yeah yes (19:26 - 19:29)
exactly but but also it's it's the (19:29 - 19:32)
method of protest and saying like oh you (19:32 - 19:34)
know why are you arresting me just (19:34 - 19:35)
because I'm playing a game in a church (19:35 - 19:37)
right it's not harming the church or (19:37 - 19:39)
anything like that and sort of like (19:39 - 19:41)
saying the response is too extreme for (19:41 - 19:44)
the action that was taken it's like if (19:44 - 19:45)
you get arrested for playing Pokemon go (19:45 - 19:47)
and in Milwaukee public park which I (19:47 - 19:49)
give you in six months that's going to (19:49 - 19:50)
happen then you're gonna say right it (19:50 - 19:54)
not necessarily like oh you were really (19:54 - 19:56)
out there to play pokemon go but it's (19:56 - 19:57)
just to prove the point if look how (19:57 - 19:59)
ridiculous i just got 10 years in the (19:59 - 20:01)
Milwaukee prisons because I was playing (20:01 - 20:03)
Pokemon go at a park very excited for my (20:03 - 20:05)
future of getting arrested for playing (20:05 - 20:07)
Pokemon go hey honey park when I was a (20:07 - 20:09)
kid I always wanted to go to prison (20:09 - 20:10)
because it's like free food you just (20:10 - 20:13)
hang out with dudes and have fun right (20:13 - 20:15)
on climb you clang in bang I would (20:15 - 20:17)
assume yeah and you don't have to work (20:17 - 20:20)
I can get ripped you like you know get (20:20 - 20:22)
some abs in there yep don't have to (20:22 - 20:24)
worry about paying rent or your electric (20:24 - 20:25)
I probably prison is not great so yeah (20:25 - 20:29)
that did two things to learn from (20:29 - 20:31)
today's program (20:31 - 20:33)
don't drink bleach don't go to prison (20:33 - 20:35)
don't don't intentionally put yourself (20:35 - 20:37)
in prison (20:37 - 20:37)
perfect speaking of Milwaukee and (20:37 - 20:41)
Milwaukee County Parks you know they're (20:41 - 20:44)
just the best I recently went down to (20:44 - 20:47)
Lake Park to get you guys some grade-a (20:47 - 20:49)
reporting so two things that is men on (20:49 - 20:51)
the street Bev I used my legs and I I (20:51 - 20:56)
got the first-hand look at Lake Park (20:56 - 20:59)
which is the main park that was focused (20:59 - 21:02)
in all the Milwaukee regulations slash (21:02 - 21:06)
rules slash laws whatever they decided (21:06 - 21:08)
to pass that don't actually do anything (21:08 - 21:11)
because at no point is somebody is a (21:11 - 21:14)
police officer gonna stop you in a park (21:14 - 21:16)
and ask you if you're playing Pokemon go (21:16 - 21:18)
just that's never going to happen I'm (21:18 - 21:21)
sure I won't say that it will probably (21:21 - 21:23)
happen but they have no way of actually (21:23 - 21:25)
like taking your phone and looking at it (21:25 - 21:27)
and being like oh now I guess guess (21:27 - 21:29)
you're just snapchatting I'm sorry (21:29 - 21:30)
continue on with your thanks Steve you (21:30 - 21:36)
just got snapchatting banned from the (21:36 - 21:37)
Milwaukee public park so you know they (21:37 - 21:39)
listen to us yeah they're they're hot on (21:39 - 21:42)
our heels they're right now considering (21:42 - 21:44)
drinking a gallon of bleach from the (21:44 - 21:46)
first day of our show this is the (21:46 - 21:48)
after-effects of being the most trusted (21:48 - 21:50)
source for Pokemon news right who else (21:50 - 21:52)
is going to report on Russians playing (21:52 - 21:54)
Pokemon go alright so the two things the (21:54 - 21:58)
first thing is that the probably the (21:58 - 22:01)
most popular part at Lake Park is called (22:01 - 22:04)
the waterfall area and what makes that (22:04 - 22:06)
so popular is there's three polka stops (22:06 - 22:08)
touching each other so a lot of people (22:08 - 22:10)
would sit down at the waterfall area and (22:10 - 22:13)
they wouldn't have to move because there (22:13 - 22:14)
was just three stops there people would (22:14 - 22:16)
lure them up you know you would sit (22:16 - 22:18)
there for hours every five minutes you (22:18 - 22:20)
got three spins tons of pokemon coming (22:20 - 22:22)
to you from reports that I cannot verify (22:22 - 22:24)
but for multiple people one of those (22:24 - 22:28)
polka stops got removed during this (22:28 - 22:31)
whole fiasco what (22:31 - 22:33)
I went there on Fri what is today I went (22:33 - 22:36)
there less than a week ago the third one (22:36 - 22:39)
was back oh so there's also a fancy (22:39 - 22:43)
restaurant down there called the Lake (22:43 - 22:44)
Park Bistro and there was two polka (22:44 - 22:46)
stops near there then there was the (22:46 - 22:48)
parking lot that everyone parked in and (22:48 - 22:50)
that's also where some of the complaints (22:50 - 22:52)
came in that parking lot (22:52 - 22:54)
is for the park but it is also for that (22:54 - 22:56)
restaurant Lake Park Bistro and Lake (22:56 - 22:59)
Park Bistro is your your one of your (22:59 - 23:02)
five-star restaurants in Milwaukee you (23:02 - 23:04)
know you're paying 50 to $100 a plate of (23:04 - 23:07)
food that might not be expensive to some (23:07 - 23:09)
people that might be outrageous to other (23:09 - 23:10)
people what doesn't matter is just a (23:10 - 23:13)
fancy restaurant some of the complaints (23:13 - 23:15)
where not only does that parking lot get (23:15 - 23:17)
filled but if you're going to Lake Park (23:17 - 23:19)
for your you know amazing dinner it's (23:19 - 23:22)
impossible to find a parking spot so I (23:22 - 23:23)
parked in that parking parked in that (23:23 - 23:25)
lot which is you know anyone parked (23:25 - 23:27)
there the two pokey stops by Lake Park (23:27 - 23:29)
Bistro they were up three by the water (23:29 - 23:31)
the waterfall were up and I didn't go (23:31 - 23:33)
any further past the waterfall there's a (23:33 - 23:35)
lighthouse there's a bridge and then (23:35 - 23:37)
there's a long open area where all the (23:37 - 23:39)
rich houses start to appear I didn't go (23:39 - 23:41)
past that area just because I was short (23:41 - 23:43)
on time but the other point it looks (23:43 - 23:45)
like at least one poke stop is back the (23:45 - 23:48)
other point is at after 10:00 p.m. and I (23:48 - 23:51)
don't know the exact time because I got (23:51 - 23:53)
there at 10:10 I was told that poky (23:53 - 23:56)
stops and Jim's closed at 10:00 p.m. so (23:56 - 24:00)
I got there at 10:10 (24:00 - 24:01)
sure enough the pokey stops were a (24:01 - 24:03)
different color they were a different (24:03 - 24:04)
shade of blue and they were closed so (24:04 - 24:06)
when you want to go spin it it said this (24:06 - 24:07)
stop is currently closed so I don't know (24:07 - 24:10)
if they're doing that in any other areas (24:10 - 24:12)
or if it's just like a Milwaukee thing (24:12 - 24:14)
but I've never heard of a pony stop her (24:14 - 24:17)
pokemon gym closing yes so weird so the (24:17 - 24:21)
gym how the gym looks is you know how (24:21 - 24:23)
like the Pokemon it's always a dragon (24:23 - 24:25)
knight or Garros or so you see the (24:25 - 24:27)
dragon I have a gyarados rotate on the (24:27 - 24:28)
gym when a gym is closed it's just a (24:28 - 24:31)
darker shade of blue and nothing is (24:31 - 24:33)
rotating on the top huh again what does (24:33 - 24:36)
Milwaukee Parks is going to do if (24:36 - 24:38)
somebody's playing pokemon go I will say (24:38 - 24:40)
that I think the closing of the stops I (24:40 - 24:44)
think that's acceptable and I think (24:44 - 24:45)
that's fine because (24:45 - 24:46)
legally parks closed at 10:00 p.m. and (24:46 - 24:49)
they open I think it at 5:00 a.m. or 6 (24:49 - 24:51)
a.m. your revolts your results may vary (24:51 - 24:54)
depending on what part of the country (24:54 - 24:56)
and not all parks closed at 10:00 okay (24:56 - 24:58)
every Milwaukee County park closes at (24:58 - 25:00)
10:00 I think most Waukesha County parks (25:00 - 25:02)
also closed at 10:00 so the problem is (25:02 - 25:05)
you have a bunch of kids teenagers and (25:05 - 25:07)
adults in the park at 11:00 yeah you can (25:07 - 25:09)
send a police officer to you know tell (25:09 - 25:11)
them to go home and and every time that (25:11 - 25:13)
happened at Lake Park the plea the (25:13 - 25:15)
people would go home I mean no one's (25:15 - 25:17)
gonna be like but officer this lawyer is (25:17 - 25:19)
gonna last for 14 minutes so they just (25:19 - 25:21)
leave but if the solution - okay it's (25:21 - 25:25)
getting too expensive to send police (25:25 - 25:27)
officers out just to tell people to go (25:27 - 25:29)
home (25:29 - 25:30)
hany antic can you just close these at (25:30 - 25:32)
10:00 that will you know naturally let (25:32 - 25:35)
people go home and solve one of the (25:35 - 25:37)
issues I behave Ian if you could if (25:37 - 25:40)
that's if you consider people being in (25:40 - 25:41)
the park after 10:00 an issue that at (25:41 - 25:44)
least solves it in a reasonable manner I (25:44 - 25:46)
don't know it's hard for me to be upset (25:46 - 25:48)
to be like oh this is ridiculous that (25:48 - 25:50)
these stops closed at 10:00 when in fact (25:50 - 25:52)
the park closes at 10:00 hmm I mean I (25:52 - 25:54)
can't argue with you there I just think (25:54 - 25:56)
10 is awfully late for a park to be open (25:56 - 25:58)
I mean what are you gonna do in a park (25:58 - 26:03)
at 10 o'clock at night go home watch TV (26:03 - 26:08)
here's some YouTube videos Washington oh (26:08 - 26:10)
my oh so that's your that's your (26:10 - 26:15)
firsthand report on Lake Park ala as the (26:15 - 26:18)
weather gets nicer I will be I I'm going (26:18 - 26:21)
to be going back there just to see if if (26:21 - 26:24)
there are still people playing Pokemon (26:24 - 26:26)
go and see if anything really changes (26:26 - 26:27)
obviously the game styles popular as it (26:27 - 26:29)
once but has been but I would still just (26:29 - 26:32)
be curious last bit of news here is new (26:32 - 26:35)

shuffle grind that was good just gonna (27:13 - 27:15)
say I've been so off that shuffle grind (27:15 - 27:17)
for so long but you were on it yeah for (27:17 - 27:20)
a while it's a fun game it is really (27:20 - 27:23)
great (27:23 - 27:23)
where are you spelling that yeah now I (27:23 - 27:25)
shuffled until I started givin them (27:25 - 27:29)
money and I'd said time to step away (27:29 - 27:31)
that's what broke me too I felt like I (27:31 - 27:34)
gave that so I played shuffles probably (27:34 - 27:36)
my third most played game on the 3ds (27:36 - 27:39)
it's like Animal Crossing Monster Hunter (27:39 - 27:42)
3 you Pokemon shuffle and I think (27:42 - 27:45)
Pokemon shuffle might have moved up to (27:45 - 27:46)
number 2 I played the game for 98 hours (27:46 - 27:49)
or whatever free and then I felt (27:49 - 27:52)
compelled enough to go okay I'll give (27:52 - 27:54)
you $25 most 3ds games are $39 I'll give (27:54 - 27:57)
you 25 I feel really good about this (27:57 - 27:59)
experience I've had a lot of enjoyment (27:59 - 28:01)
in this game and like as soon as I gave (28:01 - 28:03)
them $25 like 2 weeks later I just fell (28:03 - 28:06)
off it like broke it broke the habit I (28:06 - 28:09)
feel like well for me it was like I I (28:09 - 28:13)
gave them money and it's like I didn't (28:13 - 28:15)
win anymore (28:15 - 28:16)
any more than before I had given the (28:16 - 28:19)
money and I was like well then where's (28:19 - 28:23)
the what did I get from my money except (28:23 - 28:25)
more time playing this game when I could (28:25 - 28:28)
be breathing fresh air or Pokemon Rumble (28:28 - 28:32)
blast it's so like it's a very tough (28:32 - 28:35)
thing to get a microtransactions correct (28:35 - 28:38)
in a mobile game I feel like it's like (28:38 - 28:41)
you have to have incentive enough to (28:41 - 28:43)
help you in the game so you feel like (28:43 - 28:46)
something happened but not so much so (28:46 - 28:48)
that you just obliterate the game after (28:48 - 28:50)
it's done I think it's a tricky wire to (28:50 - 28:52)
walk and I don't think many companies (28:52 - 28:54)
get it right this is kind of an offshoot (28:54 - 28:56)
but because you guys on that Fire Emblem (28:56 - 28:58)
Heroes I fell off of that and I was (28:58 - 29:01)
really really close to giving it money (29:01 - 29:04)
and I didn't and I good job I feel (29:04 - 29:07)
really good about that yeah yeah I mean (29:07 - 29:10)
the thing is like I love that game and I (29:10 - 29:12)
love playing that game (29:12 - 29:13)
but when you (29:13 - 29:14)
ooh you could pay like $40 and you get a (29:14 - 29:17)
total of 10 new animate babies and (29:17 - 29:21)
Hannam a babies yes yes oh yeah sorry uh (29:21 - 29:24)
we used to be friends dude at least you (29:24 - 29:29)
and I have stuff in common that all SBJ (29:29 - 29:32)
does not (29:32 - 29:33)
you gotta side with the right team look (29:33 - 29:37)
I'm on your team for like 90% of thing (29:37 - 29:39)
we used to be friends do you not notice (29:39 - 29:41)
my past tense in that previous statement (29:41 - 29:44)
well this is the last of so look it's (29:44 - 29:46)
gonna be anyway the the children you you (29:46 - 29:53)
buy with with real money and firing them (29:53 - 29:55)
cost so much money it's a dick ulis like (29:55 - 29:59)
the free like you could just get them (29:59 - 30:00)
for free five at a time per week (30:00 - 30:03)
basically or you could pay like $40 to (30:03 - 30:06)
get an additional five it just doesn't (30:06 - 30:09)
it doesn't make any sense (30:09 - 30:11)
wait that's $8 per character yes that's (30:11 - 30:15)
what they want you yes it is achromatic (30:15 - 30:16)
expensive that is two Starbucks (30:16 - 30:20)
venti lattes that react just about and (30:20 - 30:25)
and I didn't throw this in but those (30:25 - 30:27)
characters are not gonna be good like (30:27 - 30:29)
maybe one of the five that you get maybe (30:29 - 30:32)
will be good yeah do they have shinies (30:32 - 30:35)
do they have Chinese anime babies if I'm (30:35 - 30:37)
gonna just be brainwashed yes Stockholm (30:37 - 30:40)
Syndrome dear yes do that they don't (30:40 - 30:42)
have any Chinese they have they have (30:42 - 30:44)
five stars which give you a little (30:44 - 30:47)
potentially sometimes five star plus (30:47 - 30:49)
isn't that a thing if you have two of (30:49 - 30:53)
the same five star unit you can have one (30:53 - 30:55)
of them eat the other one and then the (30:55 - 30:58)
it gets a plus on it which means that (30:58 - 31:00)
two of its stats are higher and then one (31:00 - 31:02)
can have comes out of its pokéball it (31:02 - 31:04)
does a little sparkle but eating ding (31:04 - 31:06)
ding ding like now unfortunately it just (31:06 - 31:08)
has a plus next to its name that's all I (31:08 - 31:10)
will never understand Fire Emblem it's (31:10 - 31:15)
like super Chiss well I love it if when (31:15 - 31:18)
they pop out of their pokeball it (31:18 - 31:19)
doesn't do a special little ding ding (31:19 - 31:21)
ding ding into those stars Mountain hmm (31:21 - 31:23)
well I mean if you get one of the like (31:23 - 31:26)
famous ones that are on the (31:26 - 31:28)
then it plays your little video we're so (31:28 - 31:31)
out famous to whom I had to never too (31:31 - 31:34)
late a foreign game in my life that I (31:34 - 31:37)
would yeah I would no one character from (31:37 - 31:40)
Bob the Builder well basically it's all (31:40 - 31:43)
hmm yeah Bob the Builder yeah you (31:43 - 31:45)
wouldn't know Bob the Builder if you saw (31:45 - 31:47)
him I know but I'm 44 years old Bob the (31:47 - 31:50)
Builder was like literally came out when (31:50 - 31:52)
I was like 33 no yeah but like clearly (31:52 - 31:55)
you know Bob the Builder right you know (31:55 - 31:57)
him so I feel like you know if it was (31:57 - 32:00)
the guy he's just like a very generic (32:00 - 32:02)
builder man all right I wouldn't know (32:02 - 32:04)
one of the fire emblem candid characters (32:04 - 32:06)
from hon taro I don't know who that is (32:06 - 32:08)
so I know I can talk about Stern hi hey (32:08 - 32:11)
taro I love Hamtaro (32:11 - 32:13)
good goodness go back to mobile games I (32:13 - 32:16)
think Logan Logan is right in the fact (32:16 - 32:18)
that like Fire Emblem Pokemon shuffle (32:18 - 32:21)
I'll even throw a clash Royale in there (32:21 - 32:23)
because I'm still playing that you're (32:23 - 32:25)
paying to accelerate your process in the (32:25 - 32:29)
game but you feel you're not getting (32:29 - 32:32)
anything from it except more game yeah (32:32 - 32:35)
like you'll eventually get there without (32:35 - 32:37)
the money (32:37 - 32:37)
like in clash Royale if I give them $20 (32:37 - 32:40)
and I use use that money to upgrade my (32:40 - 32:44)
cards yeah I might win one or two (32:44 - 32:46)
matches because I have better cards than (32:46 - 32:48)
people but then all of a sudden I hit I (32:48 - 32:50)
hit the area where all the all the (32:50 - 32:53)
people that did exactly what I did are (32:53 - 32:55)
not sitting here they did the same thing (32:55 - 32:57)
I did they paid a bunch of money their (32:57 - 32:58)
cards are over leveled and now we're all (32:58 - 33:01)
in the same area competing whereas if I (33:01 - 33:03)
don't pay money and I just suffer (33:03 - 33:05)
through facing those people who paid (33:05 - 33:08)
money at least I feel two things I feel (33:08 - 33:11)
that I didn't spend the money and also (33:11 - 33:14)
if I beat them I'm a better player (33:14 - 33:16)
because I had I had the disadvantage the (33:16 - 33:19)
entire match so I feel good there of (33:19 - 33:23)
okay you had over power cards you have (33:23 - 33:25)
the advantage yet I still won that's a (33:25 - 33:28)
good feeling (33:28 - 33:28)
hmm I think we're cosmetic or we're (33:28 - 33:32)
microtransactions work the best in these (33:32 - 33:34)
these games are chests like cosmetics (33:34 - 33:36)
like in Final Fantasy 14 the only thing (33:36 - 33:40)
they sell is (33:40 - 33:41)
is cosmetics so it's it's like oh do you (33:41 - 33:44)
want this new emote it's $7 don't it (33:44 - 33:47)
gives you zero advantage of the game (33:47 - 33:49)
you're not accelerating past anyone (33:49 - 33:52)
you're not getting any money you're it's (33:52 - 33:54)
literally just an emote or it's (33:54 - 33:55)
literally just a chocobo mount or it's (33:55 - 33:57)
just a flying dragon (33:57 - 33:59)
none of these give you any advantage (33:59 - 34:01)
whatsoever if you want them great and (34:01 - 34:03)
I'm sure they make a ton of money off (34:03 - 34:05)
though and if you don't you're not (34:05 - 34:07)
missing out yeah it's like a little (34:07 - 34:09)
custom thing you can that tailor it (34:09 - 34:13)
towards what you think is the coolest (34:13 - 34:14)
looking but it doesn't actually give you (34:14 - 34:16)
an advantage but it does give you that (34:16 - 34:18)
like like that feel good at least to me (34:18 - 34:21)
it gives me that that feel a good moment (34:21 - 34:22)
we're putting $25 in shuffle I thought I (34:22 - 34:25)
would get that but I didn't hmm of like (34:25 - 34:28)
have having a red flying dragon and (34:28 - 34:30)
everyone and like people in Tallinn oh (34:30 - 34:32)
that dragons so cool and it's like ya (34:32 - 34:34)
know spent $12.99 on this dragon most of (34:34 - 34:37)
the time if I put money into a game it's (34:37 - 34:39)
because I really have enjoyed the game (34:39 - 34:41)
and I feel like the developer deserves (34:41 - 34:44)
to get some of my money you know like (34:44 - 34:46)
not necessarily for whatever the (34:46 - 34:48)
purchase is but just for the fact that (34:48 - 34:49)
I've had a ton of enjoyment from it and (34:49 - 34:51)
yeah it's like a way of tipping yeah (34:51 - 34:54)
and that's a perfect example of tipping (34:54 - 34:57)
because you you get something that (34:57 - 34:58)
everybody can see like oh they support (34:58 - 35:00)
the game it's not it doesn't make you (35:00 - 35:02)
like better than it rails or give you (35:02 - 35:04)
the illusion that you are it's just just (35:04 - 35:06)
cool I'd rather they just show me (35:06 - 35:08)
advertisements right that way I'm not (35:08 - 35:12)
even kidding I'm so good at ignoring (35:12 - 35:13)
advertisements I just show me ads make (35:13 - 35:16)
your money that way let me play my game (35:16 - 35:17)
I'm very impatient I don't want any of (35:17 - 35:20)
those different patient - I will pay (35:20 - 35:22)
like the 399 to get rid of all ads just (35:22 - 35:25)
the speed up my experience 20 seconds me (35:25 - 35:28)
too (35:28 - 35:29)
all right well that's all our news what (35:29 - 35:31)
we'll do is we'll take a quick break and (35:31 - 35:32)
when we come back we'll do some emails (35:32 - 35:35)
Logan will give us some impressions on (35:35 - 35:37)
Sun and Moon even though they're late (35:37 - 35:38)
and we will do our Pokemon of the week (35:38 - 35:43)
gonna leave us a review on iTunes that (35:44 - 35:47)
would be much appreciated (35:47 - 35:50)
otherwise otherwise (35:52 - 36:11)
it's super (36:14 - 36:18)
it's super and we are back from our (36:18 - 36:27)
break let's let's just toss it over to (36:27 - 36:31)
Logan here and and get your impressions (36:31 - 36:34)
on Sun and Moon I know it's been a while (36:34 - 36:36)
I know you took a bunch of notes yeah (36:36 - 36:39)
but don't don't give me any fat (36:39 - 36:41)
give me the lean give me the leading (36:41 - 36:43)
stuff I mean at this point any (36:43 - 36:46)
impressions are way late but this is the (36:46 - 36:49)
first time I ever bought both versions (36:49 - 36:50)
of a Pokemon game so I did look chemical (36:50 - 36:55)
digital what I hope I saw our judges (36:55 - 36:57)
it's true yeah I don't want that taking (36:57 - 37:00)
up shelf space my house no it's just (37:00 - 37:02)
it's just imaginary but um yeah I (37:02 - 37:05)
actually bought both versions and I (37:05 - 37:07)
really enjoyed this game I think it's (37:07 - 37:08)
I'm pretty confident in saying this is (37:08 - 37:10)
my favorite generation of Pokemon and (37:10 - 37:12)
this is you know months out so I feel (37:12 - 37:14)
better about saying that without the you (37:14 - 37:17)
know like the new effect wearing off (37:17 - 37:19)
yeah so that's that's my high praise of (37:19 - 37:23)
the game I brought both versions for (37:23 - 37:25)
first time I also love you know they (37:25 - 37:29)
like the little tauros circling thing is (37:29 - 37:32)
a much better way to hatch eggs there's (37:32 - 37:35)
like quality of life improvements the (37:35 - 37:36)
bottle caps make it so you know off to (37:36 - 37:37)
soft reset for Legendary's which is (37:37 - 37:40)
awesome (37:40 - 37:41)
like everybody sort of has the option to (37:41 - 37:43)
use a legendary on their competitive (37:43 - 37:46)
team if they want to which is a really (37:46 - 37:48)
great nature though no but you can I (37:48 - 37:53)
mean that you can influence with like (37:53 - 37:54)
synchronize or whatever oh right yeah so (37:54 - 37:59)
it does it still takes time and you (37:59 - 38:02)
still have to get them up to level 100 (38:02 - 38:03)
but there's it's just way less time (38:03 - 38:07)
investment than soft resetting which was (38:07 - 38:10)
awful like I don't I mean I don't think (38:10 - 38:13)
anybody wanted to soft reset and I (38:13 - 38:17)
certainly don't think that was the (38:17 - 38:18)
intended method that the Pokemon company (38:18 - 38:21)
wanted you to use to catch your Pokemon (38:21 - 38:22)
and then use them in battle so I'm glad (38:22 - 38:26)
that they they have an answer for that I (38:26 - 38:27)
also love that there's (38:27 - 38:30)
training that you can just leave them in (38:30 - 38:32)
there I think this happened in black and (38:32 - 38:33)
white to where you could just leave them (38:33 - 38:35)
in a daycare situation and have level up (38:35 - 38:38)
over the course of days but I didn't (38:38 - 38:40)
play black and white - that's like the (38:40 - 38:41)
one game that I didn't play much choice (38:41 - 38:43)
smartness yeah maybe I'll go back (38:43 - 38:46)
sometime and play it but but it's just I (38:46 - 38:50)
don't know I didn't I black and white (38:50 - 38:52)
was my least favorite generation I I (38:52 - 38:55)
think it was just the time in my life (38:55 - 38:56)
that I was least excited about Pokemon (38:56 - 38:58)
is really what happened it didn't it (38:58 - 39:00)
doesn't reflect super on the game just (39:00 - 39:02)
like my mentality at the time and then I (39:02 - 39:06)
never picked up by can why - so yeah (39:06 - 39:08)
that's fine you do you but did you what (39:08 - 39:14)
what were your thoughts on the the Elite (39:14 - 39:16)
Four I I mean I thought okay so I (39:16 - 39:21)
thought it was fine and then I heard the (39:21 - 39:23)
episode where we'll was talking about (39:23 - 39:25)
how it's this gentrification and that (39:25 - 39:28)
made me feel complicated about it (39:28 - 39:31)
cultural appropriation not (39:31 - 39:33)
gentrification let's get our social (39:33 - 39:36)
justice terms a perfectly correct (39:36 - 39:39)
wait it's not oh I guess it Kukui is (39:39 - 39:43)
culturally appropriating from Regents or (39:43 - 39:47)
whatever I'm just feeling like like he's (39:47 - 39:49)
having like the professional golf player (39:49 - 39:52)
move in and be the most important person (39:52 - 39:54)
on the island and all that stuff I I (39:54 - 39:56)
don't know I think both terms work but (39:56 - 39:59)
yeah you probably yeah probably said (39:59 - 40:00)
cultural appropriation but it's not even (40:00 - 40:02)
so I mean just that it's like Kaku he's (40:02 - 40:04)
not Kaku he's trying to toss away what (40:04 - 40:06)
makes a Lola so special and it felt very (40:06 - 40:09)
like at the end it was pretty much the (40:09 - 40:12)
same as every Pokemon game where all the (40:12 - 40:13)
rest of the parts felt really fresh you (40:13 - 40:16)
know what else would you want at an end (40:16 - 40:18)
of a game I feel like the Elite Four is (40:18 - 40:19)
a (40:19 - 40:21)
is more memorable not so much as hmm and (40:21 - 40:27)
you've just been brainwashed no okay so (40:27 - 40:30)
you have six you have seven generations (40:30 - 40:33)
of games six generations have gyms and (40:33 - 40:35)
people were people remember specific (40:35 - 40:39)
gyms and they remember that there's (40:39 - 40:42)
eight gyms altogether but I but those (40:42 - 40:46)
aren't events in themselves like the (40:46 - 40:49)
Elite Four is where you let me let me (40:49 - 40:52)
posit an alternative right what if (40:52 - 40:54)
instead of the Elite Four they had done (40:54 - 40:57)
it where you have to do a series of (40:57 - 41:00)
totem Pokemon maybe not for maybe five (41:00 - 41:03)
totem Pokemon that act like even (41:03 - 41:05)
stronger than the totem pole I had to (41:05 - 41:08)
fight in the actual trials and they were (41:08 - 41:10)
like all right you know this is similar (41:10 - 41:12)
to what other cultures do but this is (41:12 - 41:15)
our version of it and it's totem Pokemon (41:15 - 41:17)
it's not gym leaders and you know (41:17 - 41:19)
they're gonna call out support pokemon (41:19 - 41:21)
and it'll be based on SOS battles and (41:21 - 41:23)
things like that and you know give you a (41:23 - 41:25)
different experience that is just as (41:25 - 41:28)
good but just different yeah I I don't (41:28 - 41:31)
think I mean the Elite Four is a staple (41:31 - 41:34)
but I don't think it needs to be in (41:34 - 41:37)
every game and I like that was a good (41:37 - 41:39)
idea and also like it's not our (41:39 - 41:43)
responsibility to come up with the cool (41:43 - 41:44)
new stuff (41:44 - 41:45)
exactly oh if they want to hire me I'm (41:45 - 41:49)
I'm available my point was only being (41:49 - 41:52)
that when you say you did the Elite Four (41:52 - 41:55)
and you conveyed that to somebody to (41:55 - 41:56)
instantly know what you mean whereas if (41:56 - 42:00)
I was to say hey in generation 5 I just (42:00 - 42:03)
finished the sixth gym I've I've no clue (42:03 - 42:06)
who that was or what Pokemon they had (42:06 - 42:08)
I'm pretty sure that was Scylla (42:08 - 42:10)
I thought Scala was the fifth gym that (42:10 - 42:13)
was the electric one wasn't it (42:13 - 42:16)
uh well anyway I don't have my like like (42:16 - 42:20)
V elite for is it like you you're not (42:20 - 42:24)
you don't know any details about any of (42:24 - 42:27)
the elite fours and the other games (42:27 - 42:29)
right I mean again so much is like if if (42:29 - 42:31)
a gym leader stands out to you then (42:31 - 42:33)
you'll remember that's their badge or (42:33 - 42:35)
whatever yeah same as if an Elite Four (42:35 - 42:37)
member is memorable they're just for (42:37 - 42:39)
more gym leaders just in a row whereas (42:39 - 42:42)
like I think forever everyone will be (42:42 - 42:45)
like the fire trial you know like that's (42:45 - 42:47)
crazy and super funny it's super (42:47 - 42:51)
memorable for the not just the the (42:51 - 42:56)
person who put you through the trial but (42:56 - 42:58)
for the trial itself which cannot be (42:58 - 43:00)
said about any gym battle except for (43:00 - 43:02)
that miltank I guess but that was just (43:02 - 43:05)
like frustrating but it's the same every (43:05 - 43:08)
other gym is exactly the same it's just (43:08 - 43:11)
I fought my pokemon against their (43:11 - 43:14)
pokemon and it was a fight but in you (43:14 - 43:18)
know Lola stuff happens you know like (43:18 - 43:20)
the you have to spot the difference in (43:20 - 43:22)
the images or go find ingredients to (43:22 - 43:26)
this potion we're making and that's all (43:26 - 43:29)
part of a a very a very memorable (43:29 - 43:32)
experience that yeah very different from (43:32 - 43:34)
what we've had before and I just like (43:34 - 43:37)
back to the topic I just don't think (43:37 - 43:39)
that like the Elite Four was exactly the (43:39 - 43:41)
same as it's always been (43:41 - 43:42)
just for gym leaders in a row I don't I (43:42 - 43:45)
think that was like the least strong new (43:45 - 43:48)
thing but it was still part of the book (43:48 - 43:50)
mob formula that I loved so I wasn't mad (43:50 - 43:52)
at it sure what were your thoughts on (43:52 - 43:55)
the the story they tried to tell I (43:55 - 43:57)
thought it was really good like I was it (43:57 - 43:59)
was a compelling story and I don't know (43:59 - 44:02)
that I've ever really been taken by a (44:02 - 44:05)
story (44:05 - 44:06)
I love the the oh god I've forgotten her (44:06 - 44:10)
name Lily so Lily yeah I love it Lily (44:10 - 44:14)
at the beginning of the game is not (44:14 - 44:18)
wearing clothes that she likes (44:18 - 44:19)
she's not very competent in herself or (44:19 - 44:22)
her abilities and then by the end of the (44:22 - 44:25)
game she's really grown and changed and (44:25 - 44:28)
taking on her mom (44:28 - 44:30)
and still I don't know if there's (44:30 - 44:32)
there's tons of great things that are (44:32 - 44:33)
happening with Lily it's another one of (44:33 - 44:35)
those Pokemon stories where it's not (44:35 - 44:37)
really about you it's about someone else (44:37 - 44:40)
I also felt very like my character (44:40 - 44:44)
except for his cold dead eyes (44:44 - 44:46)
and that robotic smile but I was (44:46 - 44:50)
interacting with the world and learning (44:50 - 44:51)
things about a Lola and introducing (44:51 - 44:54)
myself to people and that felt like my (44:54 - 44:56)
story even though the the overarching (44:56 - 44:58)
like world stories about lily (44:58 - 45:00)
confronting your mom that make sense (45:00 - 45:04)
yeah yeah I think so um why did you (45:04 - 45:09)
complete your a lowland pokedex yeah (45:09 - 45:11)
I've got I have a living Dex so I with (45:11 - 45:15)
or without connecting to Pokemon bank (45:15 - 45:17)
yeah I completed it (45:17 - 45:19)
connecting to put my baby yeah why would (45:19 - 45:20)
you do all the work you got the Pokemon (45:20 - 45:22)
so I'm still like I'm literally still (45:22 - 45:24)
working on my lowland pokedex and I will (45:24 - 45:26)
not connect my copy of moon to Pokemon (45:26 - 45:30)
bank until I have a not living but just (45:30 - 45:33)
to complete a lowland pokedex mm-hmm um (45:33 - 45:35)
built within moon completely and and (45:35 - 45:38)
it's just the SOS battles are killing me (45:38 - 45:40)
yeah I mean I I think that's cool that's (45:40 - 45:43)
like really extending the life of your (45:43 - 45:46)
game for you but I just connect as soon (45:46 - 45:49)
as I could (45:49 - 45:50)
um that's said like you still have the (45:50 - 45:52)
SOS battle for amorini boy that was not (45:52 - 45:55)
the most fun thing but it was kind of (45:55 - 45:57)
fun to figure out what you're supposed (45:57 - 45:59)
to do yeah I think that took me about (45:59 - 46:00)
two hours yeah I mean you can you can (46:00 - 46:03)
set it up where you have somebody to (46:03 - 46:05)
check if it's the right kind of Marini (46:05 - 46:07)
and all that stuff because I wanted to (46:07 - 46:09)
get one with the hidden ability and all (46:09 - 46:10)
that and that's that's too much well if (46:10 - 46:15)
you want a hidden ability Marini I've (46:15 - 46:17)
got a bunch of them actually I I gave (46:17 - 46:20)
some away on the the slack channel the (46:20 - 46:22)
trading slack channel a while back yeah (46:22 - 46:26)
that's my I have friends friends are for (46:26 - 46:28)
hidden abilities right but right I'll (46:28 - 46:30)
get X completion on my own that's cool I (46:30 - 46:33)
like my pocus completion like my (46:33 - 46:37)
scratching that itch section is my (46:37 - 46:40)
living decks so I I don't know if that (46:40 - 46:42)
that is a thing I'm already doing so I (46:42 - 46:45)
didn't feel like I had to wait to (46:45 - 46:47)
connect it yeah I may do that next my (46:47 - 46:50)
after I finish with the Pokedex in moon (46:50 - 46:53)
I'm going to breed my own like this is (46:53 - 46:56)
the fun team I want to go through son (46:56 - 46:58)
with mm-hmm (46:58 - 47:00)
place on and and connect that to Pokemon (47:00 - 47:02)
bang oh that would be cool yeah that'll (47:02 - 47:04)
be just like a fun play through and it's (47:04 - 47:06)
like oh I've already got a level 100 (47:06 - 47:08)
Volcarona hey I'm going to the the first (47:08 - 47:12)
trial with could get at my level okay so (47:12 - 47:17)

generations I've been really into (47:23 - 47:24)
competitive battling and so I did all (47:24 - 47:27)

experienced a pokemon battle and I love (47:33 - 47:35)

because they were all on the the Isle of (47:39 - 47:41)

writes in and says hey s PJ and crew I'm (49:38 - 49:41)
writing because I wanted to give a shout (49:41 - 49:43)
out to will for disclosing his PTSD (49:43 - 49:45)
diagnosis in last episode when my own (49:45 - 49:48)
diagnoses got a lot worse this year I (49:48 - 49:51)
recently I was really terrified but (49:51 - 49:53)
knowing that other people are going (49:53 - 49:54)
through the same have gone through the (49:54 - 49:56)
same or similar things gives me hope (49:56 - 49:58)
y'all's podcast has been a great tool (49:58 - 50:01)
for getting me through panic and racing (50:01 - 50:03)
thoughts for the last few months and has (50:03 - 50:06)
gotten me back into Pokemon letter (50:06 - 50:07)
writing and other things I love my (50:07 - 50:10)
question for you do you have a favorite (50:10 - 50:12)
type of regular trainer in the games I (50:12 - 50:15)
am a fan of furo see the girl from X&Y (50:15 - 50:18)
probably because their music was great (50:18 - 50:20)
and training against a bunch of high (50:20 - 50:22)
level audino's is even better PS I am (50:22 - 50:25)
breaking the rule saying Nick is my (50:25 - 50:27)
favorite best Sean act sm h on slack now (50:27 - 50:32)
nick being the gentleman who does all (50:32 - 50:34)
our wonderful music woo i he's my (50:34 - 50:38)
favorite too yeah he's pretty good do (50:38 - 50:42)
you want to address the PTSD i i have (50:42 - 50:45)
not gone through that but oh i didn't (50:45 - 50:48)
it's just right i don't think it's a (50:48 - 50:51)
surprise maybe it is a surprise to (50:51 - 50:52)
people that i I do see a therapist twice (50:52 - 50:56)
a week I don't know if I've ever (50:56 - 50:57)
mentioned that before but I've been I (50:57 - 50:59)
mean I know that yeah yeah you mentioned (50:59 - 51:03)
it on Twitter but I don't know if you oh (51:03 - 51:04)
yeah because I complain about how much (51:04 - 51:05)
it cost me but I've been doing it for (51:05 - 51:07)
seven years i but yeah my whole (51:07 - 51:10)
philosophy is right that I'm not ashamed (51:10 - 51:12)
of my diagnosis because I'm not the (51:12 - 51:15)
person that caused it so there's no (51:15 - 51:18)
reason for me not to say that I have a (51:18 - 51:21)
diagnosis because it's nothing to be (51:21 - 51:22)
ashamed of and it's something I'm (51:22 - 51:24)
working on and getting help with so yeah (51:24 - 51:27)
I didn't I didn't know that when you (51:27 - 51:29)
when you set it on the episode a couple (51:29 - 51:31)
weeks ago and I mean that you know I'm (51:31 - 51:33)
always I'm always glad to hear people (51:33 - 51:35)
talking about mental health and not (51:35 - 51:38)
having a stigma about anything yeah and (51:38 - 51:40)
I mean I have two diagnoses that I work (51:40 - 51:42)
with PTSD and just tie me up (51:42 - 51:44)
um neither one is particularly exciting (51:44 - 51:48)
I also go to see a therapist um though (51:48 - 51:52)
yeah it's it's helpful if everybody (51:52 - 51:54)
should should try that a couple times in (51:54 - 51:56)
their life it's helpful a comprar I (51:56 - 51:58)
think it could be helpful for anyone to (51:58 - 51:59)
go see a therapist oh I do yeah I think (51:59 - 52:01)
so too even if it's just to go in and (52:01 - 52:03)
say you know what you're doing fine yeah (52:03 - 52:06)
yeah awesome awesome advice the (52:06 - 52:11)
follow-up Shawn's question do you have a (52:11 - 52:12)
hero type of regular trainer in the game (52:12 - 52:14)
hiker of course wow I'm not even (52:14 - 52:17)
surprised (52:17 - 52:18)
I liked the veteran trainer design from (52:18 - 52:20)
black and white and I actually bought (52:20 - 52:22)
one of those like a Kangol that looks (52:22 - 52:25)
like the veteran trainer hat from black (52:25 - 52:27)
and white oh I would say that I like the (52:27 - 52:30)
pokey parents the people with the little (52:30 - 52:33)
kid and the Pikachu outfit yeah I don't (52:33 - 52:37)
know they're just kind of like warms my (52:37 - 52:38)
heart when I see them that's gonna be (52:38 - 52:41)
you someday I hope so (52:41 - 52:43)
oh I mean I'm against having kids so but (52:43 - 52:47)
whatever you have that help yeah uncle (52:47 - 52:52)
hopefully future uncle will oh that's (52:52 - 52:55)
adorable how can you be against children (52:55 - 52:57)
like that I'm already an uncle well I've (52:57 - 52:59)
got three two nieces and a nephew so (52:59 - 53:03)
it's not in the future the future is now (53:03 - 53:05)
thanks to science (53:05 - 53:06)
ah uh you just made a wrestling (53:06 - 53:13)
reference by the way ah no I actually (53:13 - 53:15)
made a reference to the Pokemon cartoon (53:15 - 53:18)
the future is now (53:18 - 53:20)
that is what Clement always says when he (53:20 - 53:22)
brings out one of his inventions all (53:22 - 53:24)
right he must be a Seth Rollins fan a (53:24 - 53:26)
will writes in from Soma Hawk Illinois I (53:26 - 53:30)
don't know where that is or how to say (53:30 - 53:32)
that city (53:32 - 53:33)
hi I am a huge fan of the show always (53:33 - 53:35)
love listening to the various takes you (53:35 - 53:37)
all provide I don't have a favorite as I (53:37 - 53:40)
think each of you bring your own thing (53:40 - 53:43)
to the table anyways my question is more (53:43 - 53:45)
of an idea that I'd like your thoughts (53:45 - 53:48)
and opinions on when you google fan made (53:48 - 53:50)
Pokemon you get tons of different (53:50 - 53:52)
designs and renders and a lot of them (53:52 - 53:54)
are really cool looking it seems in past (53:54 - 53:56)
generations Pokemon designs Sun and Moon (53:56 - 53:58)
weren't really that great in terms of (53:58 - 54:00)
the way they look only speaking from (54:00 - 54:02)
personal opinion here and to me there (54:02 - 54:05)
were quite a few that didn't look (54:05 - 54:07)
aesthetically pleasing it just seems (54:07 - 54:09)
that Pokemon can capitalize on the (54:09 - 54:11)
ingenuity of fans and maybe do a contest (54:11 - 54:15)
of sorts they release a new generation (54:15 - 54:17)
where they take the best 100 submitted (54:17 - 54:19)
designs for Pokemon or however many and (54:19 - 54:21)
slowly roll out the winners as the game (54:21 - 54:24)
release approaches the designer could (54:24 - 54:25)
submit an evolutionary line chain of (54:25 - 54:28)
Pokemon or a single non evolutionary (54:28 - 54:30)
Pokemon if they choose to do so however (54:30 - 54:32)
the contest would simply be pure design (54:32 - 54:34)
and in no way would the designers have (54:34 - 54:37)
say in what they would evolve into or (54:37 - 54:39)
what moves they could learn that could (54:39 - 54:41)
be up to Game Freak for balance reasons (54:41 - 54:43)
it goes on about the rules a little bit (54:43 - 54:46)
I'm sure fans would be willing to accept (54:46 - 54:48)
that it would be cool enough to have (54:48 - 54:50)
Pokemon or evolutionary chains of (54:50 - 54:52)
Pokemon you actually design in the games (54:52 - 54:54)
anyway sorry for the long email I just (54:54 - 54:55)
would like to hear your thoughts on that (54:55 - 54:57)
idea so I you know I play card fight (54:57 - 55:00)
Vanguard and Buescher Road which is the (55:00 - 55:03)
company that owns New Japan Pro (55:03 - 55:05)
Wrestling and card fight Vanguard every (55:05 - 55:07)
year they have a contest a design a card (55:07 - 55:09)
contest and they'll have like a junior (55:09 - 55:12)
winner and a like masters or adult (55:12 - 55:15)
winner and they actually make the cards (55:15 - 55:17)
that people design there they're never (55:17 - 55:20)
good cards there never are cards that (55:20 - 55:22)
you'd actually play with her I mean it (55:22 - 55:24)
would be a fluke if they were but it's (55:24 - 55:25)
just really cool because people submit (55:25 - 55:27)
designs you know for what they would (55:27 - 55:30)
want to see as a character on a card and (55:30 - 55:32)
then it gets actually made into a card (55:32 - 55:33)
so I I'm totally for that I think that (55:33 - 55:36)
would be a really cool just because (55:36 - 55:38)
there are so many people like so many (55:38 - 55:40)
artists and artistic people like Logan (55:40 - 55:43)
who could design really cool Pokemon (55:43 - 55:46)
that we just it would be a feast for us (55:46 - 55:51)
all to enjoy and then one person would (55:51 - 55:53)
win and be (55:53 - 55:54)
a really awesome Pokemon in the game for (55:54 - 55:56)
all time I am strictly against this but (55:56 - 55:59)
I don't know if Logan has an opinion (55:59 - 56:02)
okay I'm of two minds one is I love (56:02 - 56:06)
outsourcing like (56:06 - 56:09)
it to the fans to design Pokemon because (56:09 - 56:11)
there's lots of people who have lots of (56:11 - 56:12)
great ideas but also I really don't like (56:12 - 56:15)
contests where everybody has to put in a (56:15 - 56:16)
ton of work designing something and then (56:16 - 56:19)
only one person wins so it's like they (56:19 - 56:21)
like a ton of people put in a ton of (56:21 - 56:23)
work and only one person gets credit YUM (56:23 - 56:25)
that's the worst yeah is it really it is (56:25 - 56:29)
I just think that this your empty about (56:29 - 56:31)
your devaluing your skills yeah like to (56:31 - 56:34)
saving your skills like to say that I'm (56:34 - 56:37)
I'm an artist and I'm going to do what (56:37 - 56:42)
could be 10 to 12 hours of work for that (56:42 - 56:45)
not to be recognized in any way but (56:45 - 56:48)
somebody will be recognized and they (56:48 - 56:50)
will get no right there that they're (56:50 - 56:53)
their reward is going to be that their (56:53 - 56:55)
thing gets into the game (56:55 - 56:57)
but that their their reward is exposure (56:57 - 56:59)
yeah and exposure best right I I don't (56:59 - 57:03)
know what world you guys live in but (57:03 - 57:05)
there are literally hundreds if not (57:05 - 57:07)
thousands of people out there who are (57:07 - 57:10)
making Pokemon designs of random fake (57:10 - 57:13)
Pokemon for zero dollars and zero (57:13 - 57:16)
recognition so they're already doing (57:16 - 57:18)
this for their own pleasure and (57:18 - 57:20)
enjoyment just turn it into a contest (57:20 - 57:23)
it's gonna happen whether it's a contest (57:23 - 57:25)
or not here's here's my thoughts of it (57:25 - 57:28)
because yeah you're right at some point (57:28 - 57:30)
like most of the time they're making (57:30 - 57:31)
fake Pokemon though because that's what (57:31 - 57:32)
they enjoy doing like I enjoy I enjoy (57:32 - 57:36)
making stuff for Pokemon podcasts (57:36 - 57:38)
whether that's a new logo or new artwork (57:38 - 57:40)
or or whatnot but when somebody else (57:40 - 57:42)
asks me to do something like hey can you (57:42 - 57:44)
make me a logo that's where I want some (57:44 - 57:47)
Mota like I want something in (57:47 - 57:49)
compensation (57:49 - 57:50)
preferably money because getting a (57:50 - 57:53)
shout-out on Twitter doesn't really do (57:53 - 57:55)
anything for me that's that would that (57:55 - 57:58)
would be worth my time here's why I (57:58 - 57:59)
wouldn't want anything like this is (57:59 - 58:01)
because you can say that these fake (58:01 - 58:05)
Pokemon look cool or these real Pokemon (58:05 - 58:07)
don't look cool but Pokemon is so much (58:07 - 58:10)
more than just the design just the (58:10 - 58:12)
moveset just the abilities Pokemon are (58:12 - 58:17)
designed in a way to last the tests of (58:17 - 58:22)
time yeah something like a Kuna or a (58:22 - 58:25)
Beedrill or a cloister you might not (58:25 - 58:28)
think are the coolest design Pokemon but (58:28 - 58:31)
those designs have held up for over 20 (58:31 - 58:34)
years when people see a Beedrill they (58:34 - 58:37)
instantly know that it's a Beedrill and (58:37 - 58:38)
I'm not saying that these artists aren't (58:38 - 58:40)
talented and they can't come up with (58:40 - 58:41)
something but there are so many (58:41 - 58:45)
references in so much history and and so (58:45 - 58:49)
much more than just a design that goes (58:49 - 58:50)
into Pokemon something as simple as like (58:50 - 58:53)
ditto ditto is a word in the dictionary (58:53 - 58:55)
that means like to copy enlightenment (58:55 - 58:57)
the name is just as important as ya as (58:57 - 59:02)
Ben Zion as it makes into the world I (59:02 - 59:05)
mean you look at something like (59:05 - 59:06)
bouffalant tauros and you go oh Toro (59:06 - 59:08)
should evolve them to muffle it and it (59:08 - 59:10)
doesn't and I think I think that's (59:10 - 59:12)
totally okay because there are (59:12 - 59:14)
definitely species of animals that exist (59:14 - 59:16)
that they while they might look the same (59:16 - 59:19)
they aren't related and I think that (59:19 - 59:22)
makes sense in making the Pokemon world (59:22 - 59:24)
feel more believable and when you have a (59:24 - 59:26)
core set of artists in a core group (59:26 - 59:29)
working together and ensuring that (59:29 - 59:31)
consistency when you do a contest of (59:31 - 59:34)
everyone draw your coolest Pokemon (59:34 - 59:36)
design and we're gonna base that off of (59:36 - 59:38)
how cool that design and that has (59:38 - 59:40)
nothing to do with the name that has (59:40 - 59:41)
nothing to do how it fits in the world (59:41 - 59:42)
that has nothing to do with longevity (59:42 - 59:44)
you are easy I made you've made rules (59:44 - 59:47)
for this contest that don't exist what (59:47 - 59:49)
if it's the same piece team of people (59:49 - 59:50)
who are working on Pokemon designs who (59:50 - 59:52)
are like we're gonna pick which design (59:52 - 59:54)
we want to include and then it's like (59:54 - 59:55)
whichever one comes most close to our (59:55 - 59:57)
style that one wins but the latest it (59:57 - 60:00)
validated everything you said know that (60:00 - 60:02)
it doesn't because what do you do what (60:02 - 60:05)
do you do with that design like how do (60:05 - 60:07)
you decide to name it how do you set it (60:07 - 60:09)
is so important for Pokemon and there's (60:09 - 60:11)
another question kind of related to this (60:11 - 60:12)
to protect their franchise as as strong (60:12 - 60:16)
as possible and once you open that up to (60:16 - 60:18)
other artists of like oh these 823 (60:18 - 60:22)
Pokemon were designed by people that (60:22 - 60:24)
work for the Pokemon company and this (60:24 - 60:26)
one wasn't theirs it just breaks that (60:26 - 60:30)
that mold of pretty much 21 years of (60:30 - 60:34)
legacy you don't see (60:34 - 60:35)
like a Zelda game have what one fan-made (60:35 - 60:38)
thing just sitting in the corner I think (60:38 - 60:40)
we could find a compromise a middle (60:40 - 60:43)
ground on this somewhere yeah I I just (60:43 - 60:45)
don't want to be a contest that's all (60:45 - 60:47)
it's my I go like what this is just (60:47 - 60:51)
because you young I'm gonna loop you in (60:51 - 60:54)
with the rest of them Logan and (60:54 - 60:55)
Millennials Jessica don't like to (60:55 - 60:57)
compete you don't let me want to live in (60:57 - 60:59)
a cutthroat world where one person is (60:59 - 61:02)
the clear winner and the arrests of (61:02 - 61:03)
everybody else is dead okay so what like (61:03 - 61:06)
I didn't hear anything you said pets (61:06 - 61:07)
Millennials because I stopped listening (61:07 - 61:08)
haha what okay so you have a contest (61:08 - 61:11)
let's let's look at this as a as a (61:11 - 61:14)
company thing why would a company ever (61:14 - 61:17)
do a contest the reason would be to get (61:17 - 61:19)
their name out there Pokemon in no way (61:19 - 61:21)
needs to get their name out there they (61:21 - 61:23)
have they get zero benefit of people (61:23 - 61:26)
retweeting or sharing or hosting some (61:26 - 61:29)
kind of contest when all they need to do (61:29 - 61:31)
is easily show one or two new Pokemon (61:31 - 61:33)
that they designed and they will (61:33 - 61:35)
instantly get mainstream media they will (61:35 - 61:38)
instantly get what they are looking for (61:38 - 61:39)
they don't need a contest to do that on (61:39 - 61:41)
top of that they don't need to take (61:41 - 61:43)
thousands of people and make them all (61:43 - 61:46)
feel terrible that their design didn't (61:46 - 61:48)
win and then take one person and say (61:48 - 61:50)
their design one for again what benefit (61:50 - 61:54)
is that company getting they are getting (61:54 - 61:56)
a design that they will now have to (61:56 - 61:57)
shoehorn into their game because they (61:57 - 61:59)
must pick a winner what if all a (61:59 - 62:01)
thousand designs are terrible what if (62:01 - 62:03)
the contest is you submit some Pokemon (62:03 - 62:06)
designs and then we'll invite you to (62:06 - 62:08)
come with our team and work with our (62:08 - 62:10)
team to design a pokemon so then they're (62:10 - 62:12)
not shoehorning in but you've still got (62:12 - 62:14)
a contest what's wrong with having a (62:14 - 62:16)
contest that's like a good we'll just (62:16 - 62:18)
like I will look audience participation (62:18 - 62:20)
that's good like trying to make money (62:20 - 62:22)
and it doesn't have to always got it got (62:22 - 62:24)
ours are only for like self-promotion (62:24 - 62:28)
and getting your name out there and (62:28 - 62:29)
Pokemon is in no way to need to do you (62:29 - 62:31)
see moose in they made 800 designs I (62:31 - 62:34)
think they've got I think they've (62:34 - 62:36)
they've mastered how to show off Pokemon (62:36 - 62:38)
that set such a cynical viewpoint that's (62:38 - 62:41)
so dark that the that sonically is (62:41 - 62:44)
you're gonna make $1 you're gonna miss (62:44 - 62:45)
your guy too easily waste thousands (62:45 - 62:49)
of people's time for putting in as like (62:49 - 62:51)
the most work that they can possibly do (62:51 - 62:54)
to find out that they're not picked (62:54 - 62:56)
there's nothing of there's nothing more (62:56 - 62:59)
disappointing to an artist to or anyone (62:59 - 63:02)
in a creative field of work to do 10 to (63:02 - 63:04)
12 hours if not more work to like know (63:04 - 63:07)
that I'm not going to get a response no (63:07 - 63:09)
one's going to see this I'm not going to (63:09 - 63:11)
say I'm not going to get a thanks but no (63:11 - 63:13)
thanks (63:13 - 63:13)
you're not going to get anything because (63:13 - 63:15)
no company is going to email thousands (63:15 - 63:19)
of people but one and say sorry no (63:19 - 63:20)
thanks you know that 15 hours of work (63:20 - 63:22)
better luck next time (63:22 - 63:24)
hey guess what we're not doing it next (63:24 - 63:25)
time like so so all those people out (63:25 - 63:27)
there on deviantART who are spending (63:27 - 63:29)
hours and hours and posting things up (63:29 - 63:31)
there just for one person to click a (63:31 - 63:33)
like button that's somehow different (63:33 - 63:36)
yeah it's entirely different they've (63:36 - 63:37)
absolutely different they chose to do (63:37 - 63:39)
that that's what they're doing and so (63:39 - 63:41)
but you're choosing to enter the contest (63:41 - 63:43)
and it should be the joy of creating art (63:43 - 63:45)
it's not the a very you know it's not a (63:45 - 63:48)
job in turn the music contest I don't (63:48 - 63:50)
know when it's for a corporation I think (63:50 - 63:53)
the waters get muddy like there it's not (63:53 - 63:55)
just the joy of creating art it's you're (63:55 - 63:57)
making a product that it's going to make (63:57 - 64:00)
the corporation money so so you're (64:00 - 64:02)
telling me all of those bands who sing (64:02 - 64:04)
for Eurovision the except for the one (64:04 - 64:07)
band that wins at all that as well I (64:07 - 64:08)
can't believe I just wasted the past (64:08 - 64:10)
months of my life putting together this (64:10 - 64:12)
performance or do I have the joy of (64:12 - 64:15)
having different not your average the (64:15 - 64:17)
difference there is they're on TV right (64:17 - 64:20)
that is that is for real some exposure (64:20 - 64:22)
and also I'm I would wager they are paid (64:22 - 64:25)
so Pokemon company puts the best designs (64:25 - 64:29)
on the website and says okay here's the (64:29 - 64:32)
top 50 design no no no no colors that's (64:32 - 64:35)
just exposure $10 is a joke (64:35 - 64:37)
10 like to be like here's $10 okay it's (64:37 - 64:40)
two lattes no that's a jungle days a lot (64:40 - 64:43)
on top of the fact that you want people (64:43 - 64:45)
to vote when we already know designs (64:45 - 64:47)
like Charizard designs like Lucario and (64:47 - 64:49)
designs like Pikachu are them the number (64:49 - 64:51)
one poke like Pokemon in the world and (64:51 - 64:53)
you want people that love those three (64:53 - 64:55)
Pokemon to vote no absolutely not wait (64:55 - 64:57)
no I didn't say vote when did I say vote (64:57 - 65:01)
you set the designs up on the website (65:01 - 65:03)
and have people vote no that's not what (65:03 - 65:05)
I said I just said put the best designs (65:05 - 65:08)
on the website so that's exposure for (65:08 - 65:10)
people that's the same thing and the (65:10 - 65:12)
other problem with putting the best (65:12 - 65:14)
designs on the website is now you're now (65:14 - 65:15)
you're you're showing off people's work (65:15 - 65:18)
and again exposure means nothing it is (65:18 - 65:20)
the worst you're showing off people's (65:20 - 65:23)
work and you're getting your you're (65:23 - 65:25)
making more people upset because you're (65:25 - 65:27)
going to have all these people looking (65:27 - 65:28)
at these Pokemon and then complaining to (65:28 - 65:30)
the Pokemon company why they picked a (65:30 - 65:32)
over B or Y C was it wasn't picked or (65:32 - 65:35)
why Pokemon D looks terrible but somehow (65:35 - 65:38)
made it with the other three pokemon (65:38 - 65:40)
like that is is just a marketing (65:40 - 65:42)
nightmare well I'm sorry the Pokemon (65:42 - 65:45)
company gets complaints every time they (65:45 - 65:46)
announce new Pokemon anyways cuz it's (65:46 - 65:48)
always like well this one looks like a (65:48 - 65:50)
Digimon it doesn't look like a Pokemon (65:50 - 65:52)
anymore blah blah blah anger anger anger (65:52 - 65:53)
and you're so silly against littell you (65:53 - 65:57)
live in a world I know joy come on still (65:57 - 65:59)
look good they still hold that (65:59 - 66:01)
I'm so sad we're still talking about (66:01 - 66:03)
this I just because a what's we're in a (66:03 - 66:06)
bizarre world where I'm arguing from the (66:06 - 66:09)
point of view of just like the joy of (66:09 - 66:10)
creation is the joy in itself (66:10 - 66:12)
and Steve's in this dark cynical place (66:12 - 66:14)
of like the job is not for the dollars (66:14 - 66:17)
for a billion-dollar company is a (66:17 - 66:19)
totally different conversation than a (66:19 - 66:21)
joy of me making art on a Saturday night (66:21 - 66:23)
for my deviantart end of story there's (66:23 - 66:25)
like no comparison there yes it's it's (66:25 - 66:28)
like I'd be doing it anyways and now I'm (66:28 - 66:30)
doing it for a potential opportunity (66:30 - 66:31)
which means it is no longer just a (66:31 - 66:33)
potential opportunity you apply at (66:33 - 66:36)
gamefreak or the Pokemon company you get (66:36 - 66:38)
a job and you get paid for it you'll (66:38 - 66:40)
never get that job this is why we need (66:40 - 66:41)
the philosopher on this program to let (66:41 - 66:43)
us know what philosophy informs us (66:43 - 66:46)
Travis come back I let me out of my cage (66:46 - 66:49)
just to fight with me next question here (66:49 - 66:52)
is from Ray hello team usual comments (66:52 - 66:55)
about greatness here I would I would (66:55 - 66:58)
like to talk about one thing that (66:58 - 67:00)
everyone likes to talk about race I love (67:00 - 67:02)
the race conversation that took place (67:02 - 67:03)
during the san playthrough Sun and Moon (67:03 - 67:06)
plate I was like who's Sam the Sun and (67:06 - 67:09)
Moon play through episodes and would (67:09 - 67:11)
love to have the thoughts on spj and (67:11 - 67:13)
crew for the following issue (67:13 - 67:14)
boy we went into one hot topic into the (67:14 - 67:16)
next here as race rate as race relation (67:16 - 67:20)
is perdant to mention that I am a white (67:20 - 67:23)
male married to a black female when I go (67:23 - 67:25)
out we are asked over half the time if (67:25 - 67:28)
we are splitting the check as though (67:28 - 67:29)
it's not clear that my wife and I are (67:29 - 67:31)
together my simple question how often (67:31 - 67:33)
are you asked if you are splitting the (67:33 - 67:35)
check when in your mind it is clear that (67:35 - 67:37)
you are on a date what do you think why (67:37 - 67:39)
do you think some people are asked this (67:39 - 67:41)
more often than others also will is the (67:41 - 67:43)
best an ammonite is the worst thank you (67:43 - 67:46)
Ray I have I have a different story (67:46 - 67:48)
others say I Logan I'm sure you have (67:48 - 67:51)
something related to this it's related (67:51 - 67:53)
to this topic of the checks being (67:53 - 67:56)
presented to people as to sir anyway (67:56 - 67:58)
last night me and my boyfriend Billy (67:58 - 68:02)
were eating at a restaurant it's just us (68:02 - 68:06)
just two people and the the guy comes (68:06 - 68:10)
over and offers us two checks and not (68:10 - 68:13)
only that but he has like a pink pen (68:13 - 68:15)
he's like oh I won't I won't give you a (68:15 - 68:16)
pink pen and I was just like what why (68:16 - 68:18)
what why not also it's just one check (68:18 - 68:21)
and I don't let me get that pink pen let (68:21 - 68:25)
me can I can I get that pink pen I (68:25 - 68:27)
really like pink I I don't know that's a (68:27 - 68:30)
similar situation I don't I just think (68:30 - 68:32)
it's funny in that situation the the (68:32 - 68:36)
topic of race like uh we should probably (68:36 - 68:39)
get Irene back on so we can have a (68:39 - 68:41)
person of color to talk about that (68:41 - 68:43)
because it's really yeah we're about the (68:43 - 68:45)
three whitest dudes you could get yeah I (68:45 - 68:49)
I mean I haven't really experienced (68:49 - 68:52)
problems with that I know those problems (68:52 - 68:54)
exist of like oh this white dude in this (68:54 - 68:56)
black chick are they together or they (68:56 - 68:59)
not together I get I don't really I have (68:59 - 69:02)
never really seen that in a restaurant (69:02 - 69:04)
most of the like I'm in a restaurant (69:04 - 69:06)
with couples anyway so it's always I (69:06 - 69:08)
maybe it's just a Wisconsin thing where (69:08 - 69:10)
they just assume that if it's any amount (69:10 - 69:14)
of people at a table we're gonna put it (69:14 - 69:15)
all on one check even though it's clear (69:15 - 69:17)
that we're all 20-somethings that are (69:17 - 69:20)
you know not family at all and org is (69:20 - 69:23)
clearly that these are a group of (69:23 - 69:25)
friends but we're going to put it all in (69:25 - 69:26)
the same check anyways that's like (69:26 - 69:28)
Wisconsin restaurant see if they like (69:28 - 69:31)
specifically ask hey can you split this (69:31 - 69:33)
like to here to there but I definitely (69:33 - 69:35)
like yet looks some of the times and (69:35 - 69:38)
that's from like both ends of the (69:38 - 69:39)
spectrum whether it's like white people (69:39 - 69:41)
judging me that I'm with a black girl or (69:41 - 69:43)
black people judging her that she's with (69:43 - 69:46)
a white dude and it's it's whatever it's (69:46 - 69:48)
just like it's what Logan said it's more (69:48 - 69:51)
funny than anything to be like okay yep (69:51 - 69:53)
this is still the world we live in (69:53 - 69:55)
all right Rachel what a shame my parents (69:55 - 69:58)
are like some of the most racist people (69:58 - 69:59)
ever and it was that was probably the (69:59 - 70:02)
hardest thing to overcome was I remember (70:02 - 70:05)
Irene and I were dating for probably (70:05 - 70:08)
three to four months before I told my (70:08 - 70:10)
mom and my mom was like instantly (70:10 - 70:13)
disgusted and like very unhappy that she (70:13 - 70:17)
considered it a Mira Belling against (70:17 - 70:21)
them to be dating a non-white person and (70:21 - 70:24)
then it was like this slow kind of roll (70:24 - 70:27)
out to like she finally met Irene and (70:27 - 70:30)
then kind of had more conversations with (70:30 - 70:33)
Irene and you know when I showed up (70:33 - 70:35)
Irene would be there and so they were (70:35 - 70:37)
kind of forced to talk and my mom did (70:37 - 70:39)
like a complete 180 and she loves Irene (70:39 - 70:43)
now she Texas Irene more than she taxes (70:43 - 70:45)
me she go shopping with just Irene like (70:45 - 70:48)
they go to Six Flags all all the time in (70:48 - 70:52)
the summer together like she is just the (70:52 - 70:54)
other day she was like when are you when (70:54 - 70:56)
are you and Irene getting married oh she (70:56 - 70:58)
is so she just loves Irene so much and (70:58 - 71:01)
like that was awesome to see and I like (71:01 - 71:04)
it for me it was a little bit it was (71:04 - 71:07)
easy to forgive her mom you used to be (71:07 - 71:10)
really racist and now you're not and so (71:10 - 71:12)
it's hard for me to be mad because like (71:12 - 71:14)
she changed like she took in a time to (71:14 - 71:17)
get to know Irene and by getting to know (71:17 - 71:20)
Irene like she opened up to like more (71:20 - 71:23)
you know black people outside of Irene (71:23 - 71:24)
and like that was really good to see but (71:24 - 71:27)
my dad on the other hand still pretty (71:27 - 71:29)
racist still likes to drop words that (71:29 - 71:32)
should not be said but he does like (71:32 - 71:34)
Irene but that was that was even even (71:34 - 71:36)
harder battling my dad's a lost cause (71:36 - 71:38)
haha (71:38 - 71:39)
nobody's lost cause till they're dead (71:39 - 71:41)
sir (71:41 - 71:42)
ugly sooner than later for the amount (71:42 - 71:43)
the amount of where he is at with his (71:43 - 71:46)
health bottle boy huh yeah I I'm never (71:46 - 71:51)
dating again (71:51 - 71:52)
I don't date now and I'm never going to (71:52 - 71:54)
ever again so the dating question is not (71:54 - 71:56)
a concern for me no one's a lost cause (71:56 - 71:58)
until they're dead will Wow I didn't say (71:58 - 72:02)
his lost cause I was a choice I've made (72:02 - 72:04)
uh but I would say so (72:04 - 72:06)
my one input I have on discussion of (72:06 - 72:09)
race and I think I brought this up to (72:09 - 72:10)
Steve before um and it's really kind of (72:10 - 72:14)
been something I've noticed as I travel (72:14 - 72:16)
more to go and hang out with Steve and (72:16 - 72:19)
do Pokemon events and things like that (72:19 - 72:21)
is little isn't the worst no living in (72:21 - 72:25)
Washington DC and like living on the (72:25 - 72:27)
East Coast the majority of my life (72:27 - 72:30)
I see people of color all the time (72:30 - 72:33)
everywhere I go you know everything just (72:33 - 72:35)
like you know there's no part of the (72:35 - 72:38)
city I go to nothing I do in my day (72:38 - 72:40)
where I'm not interacting with people of (72:40 - 72:42)
color but then I'll go to places like (72:42 - 72:45)
Milwaukee and I'll go to places like (72:45 - 72:47)
Indianapolis and it's like I don't see (72:47 - 72:51)
any people of color in the parts of the (72:51 - 72:53)
towns that I go to and it's just so (72:53 - 72:55)
striking to me like to go to the grocery (72:55 - 72:58)
store and have everybody in the grocery (72:58 - 73:00)
store be white that's not my experience (73:00 - 73:02)
here in DC and that that's when it (73:02 - 73:05)
becomes noticeable to me that in (73:05 - 73:07)
different parts of the country they're (73:07 - 73:09)
not having that diverse experience that (73:09 - 73:12)
I just live with in my day-to-day you (73:12 - 73:14)
know that's it (73:14 - 73:16)
here's to hoping more people have more (73:16 - 73:18)
diverse experiences and come to an (73:18 - 73:20)
understanding like Steve's mom did yeah (73:20 - 73:23)
there's anything that my mom's done (73:23 - 73:25)
right the last five years it was like (73:25 - 73:28)
come around on racial tension whoo this (73:28 - 73:30)
is so heavy (73:30 - 73:31)
this Pokemon podcast is real heavy here (73:31 - 73:35)
we go here's a lighthearted one this (73:35 - 73:37)
message is from Michael alala spj and (73:37 - 73:40)
crew I would like to know what your (73:40 - 73:41)
favorite songs from the Pokemon anime is (73:41 - 73:43)
and not any of the openings but the but (73:43 - 73:47)
the cheap knockoffs like NSYNC or Lizzie (73:47 - 73:49)
McGuire soundings sounding like songs (73:49 - 73:52)
from the official soundtracks all of (73:52 - 73:54)

of you own any of the CDs like to be a (74:00 - 74:02)
master anyways keep doing the awesome (74:02 - 74:05)
things you are doing you all are awesome (74:05 - 74:07)
best regards Michael uh yeah I had to be (74:07 - 74:10)

great I have none of this I have no (74:17 - 74:19)
input no you haven't you you never got (74:19 - 74:22)
to be a master dude I was like what 26 (74:22 - 74:25)
when these games came out no I was (74:25 - 74:28)
listening to some cool techno music at (74:28 - 74:30)
that time listen like a blonde or (74:30 - 74:32)
something no I was never Nirvana (74:32 - 74:34)
listener uh they're on shitter brothers (74:34 - 74:37)

oh no Moby no Moby no ha ha ha (74:45 - 74:50)
rhinoceros if you really want to go for (74:50 - 74:52)
a throwback there but yeah now I was in (74:52 - 74:54)
a different place hmm musically yeah at (74:54 - 74:59)
a certain point in my life I had the (74:59 - 75:00)
entire pokerap memorized (75:00 - 75:02)
yeah me too I mean look I I feel like (75:02 - 75:05)
every song on to be a master is pretty (75:05 - 75:07)
good yeah I don't recall it that well (75:07 - 75:09)
but I think if I listen to it now I'd be (75:09 - 75:12)
like oh no these are bad but but like (75:12 - 75:15)
bad in a good way of like I remember (75:15 - 75:16)
singing my heart out to this as a kid (75:16 - 75:18)
yeah like a fun bad not like like (75:18 - 75:22)
rustling smell like wrestling at all (75:22 - 75:26)
what what are you talking about every (75:26 - 75:29)
memory I have a wrestling is pristine (75:29 - 75:31)
and perfect and great I got a a Japanese (75:31 - 75:35)
album in Boston Nick who gets mentioned (75:35 - 75:39)
on the show more than enough I feel like (75:39 - 75:41)
he took us to one of these uh I don't (75:41 - 75:46)
know what to call it like a like a small (75:46 - 75:48)
Hannam a slash toy shop that's nothing (75:48 - 75:51)
but import stuff from Japan and they had (75:51 - 75:54)
a bunch of of Digimon and yugioh and (75:54 - 75:58)
Pokemon and one piece and Avatar just (75:58 - 76:04)
everywhere and they were and Nick (76:04 - 76:07)
actually went in because he was like (76:07 - 76:08)
they close at 9:00 (76:08 - 76:09)
and we didn't get we didn't get to that (76:09 - 76:11)
area until like 855 he went in and he (76:11 - 76:13)
asked if they could stay open a little (76:13 - 76:15)
later so we could look because they had (76:15 - 76:16)
dad some legit Pokemon stuff they even (76:16 - 76:19)
had the little monster hunter like (76:19 - 76:20)
figure statues and they did so they (76:20 - 76:24)
stayed open later and now now because (76:24 - 76:26)
they offered to sale open later because (76:26 - 76:28)
you know we're out of town and and they (76:28 - 76:31)
were about to close I was I felt (76:31 - 76:33)
obligated to buy something for them (76:33 - 76:35)
staying open later so I was looking and (76:35 - 76:38)
looking cuz they had all these great (76:38 - 76:40)
Pokemon things and I was like I want (76:40 - 76:41)
something that's not extremely (76:41 - 76:43)
overpriced (76:43 - 76:44)
but also something that I can't just (76:44 - 76:46)
jump on ebay for and and buy at the same (76:46 - 76:49)
overpriced price and I found a a music (76:49 - 76:55)
CD an album that was Howard how to draw (76:55 - 76:59)
a Pokemon and it was four songs and then (76:59 - 77:02)
a a small coloring book all in like this (77:02 - 77:05)
this audio case would teach you how to (77:05 - 77:09)
draw like a Pikachu and like a Voltorb (77:09 - 77:11)
and like a Jigglypuff like the easiest (77:11 - 77:13)
Pokemon the draw and there's just there (77:13 - 77:16)
maybe five songs but five really very (77:16 - 77:19)
Japanese very kids very poppy songs that (77:19 - 77:23)
I don't understand but I want to do (77:23 - 77:24)
something with it in the future because (77:24 - 77:26)
it was such a such a weird find and I (77:26 - 77:30)
think it's super fascinating and it came (77:30 - 77:32)
out within the first year of Pokemon (77:32 - 77:34)
debuting in Japan so it's very old very (77:34 - 77:38)
cool so I want to do something with that (77:38 - 77:39)
but that's just piggybacking off the (77:39 - 77:42)
whole audio CD slash music thing yeah (77:42 - 77:44)
let's do a couple more emails here this (77:44 - 77:46)

recommended to me I have I wrote to ask (78:34 - 78:37)
you guys two questions one what is your (78:37 - 78:39)
favorite type of trainer in the Pokemon (78:39 - 78:41)
series I feel like we just answered this (78:41 - 78:42)
and two if you were to get rid of one (78:42 - 78:45)
type of type which would you remove come (78:45 - 78:49)
on purely of that type would change to (78:49 - 78:52)
another type for example Dharma no tan (78:52 - 78:55)
would become fire fighting if it fire (78:55 - 78:57)
was removed kale masa says I like I feel (78:57 - 79:00)
like I read isn't getting enough love (79:00 - 79:02)
from the PKM caste community so hashtag (79:02 - 79:05)
team Irene thanks so much for the work (79:05 - 79:07)
and keep the tomb tube Warner warmers (79:07 - 79:10)
clean and keep the tube warmers clean in (79:10 - 79:13)
2017 Caleb a hash tag team Irene yeah I (79:13 - 79:18)
mean I read as my friend I mean that's (79:18 - 79:22)
even better than just podcast love I (79:22 - 79:26)
guess so raise your intentions no I'm (79:26 - 79:29)
kidding ah not again uh I would still go (79:29 - 79:34)
with pokey parents for the first (79:34 - 79:36)
question yeah hiker Phil oh I (79:36 - 79:39)
preschooler this time yeah a real cute (79:39 - 79:43)
oh they're pretty great and then you (79:43 - 79:45)
take their money ah question to which (79:45 - 79:47)
type would you remove from the game (79:47 - 79:48)
normal I don't I it's so silly to me (79:48 - 79:52)
that there is a normal type like ah that (79:52 - 79:56)
was my answer to I can see that but I (79:56 - 79:59)
was actually thinking ground okay all (79:59 - 80:02)
right I can see that because you have (80:02 - 80:03)
rock and you have mine yes deal all (80:03 - 80:06)
right that's good choice my to piggyback (80:06 - 80:08)
off Logan to have a type that is normal (80:08 - 80:12)
just seems so weird in the fact that no (80:12 - 80:14)
Pokemon are actually normal yeah nothing (80:14 - 80:18)
yeah normal just looking at the birds (80:18 - 80:21)
like Pidgeot or furo (80:21 - 80:22)
why are they normal flying did you could (80:22 - 80:25)
just keep me flying yeah because then (80:25 - 80:28)
they'd be Opie that's not my problem (80:28 - 80:30)
anymore maybe maybe in generation 1 they (80:30 - 80:33)
would have been just Opie but now that's (80:33 - 80:35)
that's not really an issue (80:35 - 80:37)
right yeah I think it's totally fine to (80:37 - 80:39)
remove normal cuz I mean like Steve (80:39 - 80:41)
saying everything should be able to be (80:41 - 80:45)
in a type I mean normal doesn't make any (80:45 - 80:47)
sense maybe replace that with sound type (80:47 - 80:50)
yeah that's all I'm talking about good (80:50 - 80:53)
yeah yeah it just feels like each (80:53 - 80:56)
Pokemon should have strengths and (80:56 - 80:59)
weaknesses and normal doesn't really (80:59 - 81:01)
benefit from that at all yeah it's so (81:01 - 81:04)
weird like ghosts can't hit right at I (81:04 - 81:08)
don't know it isn't like that makes (81:08 - 81:10)
sense (81:10 - 81:10)
the go is the normal like okay cool I (81:10 - 81:13)
get it yeah but something like delcatty (81:13 - 81:16)
which is just a normal cat Pokemon no no (81:16 - 81:20)
one's ever gonna use delcatty dope (81:20 - 81:22)
Kenny's great super cute would love to (81:22 - 81:25)
use it make it ice or something or Dirk (81:25 - 81:30)
I don't know I mean like you if you made (81:30 - 81:32)
it I see you'd have to pretty (81:32 - 81:33)
significantly change its design but yeah (81:33 - 81:36)
I don't know there's probably an answer (81:36 - 81:37)
in there somewhere but I just don't like (81:37 - 81:39)
the I just don't like that there's a (81:39 - 81:40)
normal type alright I said that was the (81:40 - 81:42)
last one but we'll do one more yeah no I (81:42 - 81:44)
just don't want to fall too behind on (81:44 - 81:46)
these yeah (81:46 - 81:47)
it's doing alder one oh this is the one (81:47 - 81:49)
I was referencing earlier the scheme (81:49 - 81:51)
those are those will stir up a debate (81:51 - 81:53)
joseph Wrightson titled fan games and (81:53 - 81:56)
fossils hey everyone semi longtime (81:56 - 81:58)
listener I never never completed a (81:58 - 82:00)
Pokemon game gasps but I am still a huge (82:00 - 82:02)
fan of the series I have two questions (82:02 - 82:04)
that I hope will spark spark some (82:04 - 82:05)
discussion first first you may have (82:05 - 82:08)
heard of a few months ago about a an (82:08 - 82:09)
unexpected takedown of a fan game six (82:09 - 82:11)
years in the making called pokemon (82:11 - 82:13)
uranium only a few days after Atlanta (82:13 - 82:15)
launched last fall they were contacted (82:15 - 82:17)
by Nintendo lawyers in order to take it (82:17 - 82:19)
down with no warning or consider my (82:19 - 82:21)
entry into the Pokemon universe a (82:21 - 82:23)
browser MMO called Pokemon Omega that (82:23 - 82:26)
was ordered to cease indices after years (82:26 - 82:28)
of building a thriving community shortly (82:28 - 82:30)
before the release of Omega Ruby alpha (82:30 - 82:33)
sapphire for obvious reasons on the (82:33 - 82:35)
other hand I'm sure you've heard of (82:35 - 82:36)
pixelmon minecraft mod which allows you (82:36 - 82:39)
to catch train and battle blocky Pokemon (82:39 - 82:41)
in your Minecraft world this is (82:41 - 82:42)
obviously still up and running after (82:42 - 82:44)
after an equally illusionists history (82:44 - 82:48)
despite not being affiliated with (82:48 - 82:51)
all so question 1 what do you think (82:51 - 82:53)
about the way Nintendo and Game Freak is (82:53 - 82:55)
are handling their intellectual (82:55 - 82:56)
properties regarding fan games and other (82:56 - 82:58)
things like these on the other hand (82:58 - 83:00)
copyright law is very much a thing but (83:00 - 83:01)
on the other hand it's worth much (83:01 - 83:03)
mentioning how much free advertising (83:03 - 83:05)
games can be from from this afterall I (83:05 - 83:08)
was drawn to the series through a fan (83:08 - 83:09)
game and question 2 (83:09 - 83:11)
on a completely different note how do (83:11 - 83:12)
you feel about their no new fossils in (83:12 - 83:14)
Sun and Moon I've always been a fan of (83:14 - 83:16)
fossil Pokemon and I'm a little (83:16 - 83:17)
disappointed that Game Freak missed what (83:17 - 83:19)
could be a neat opportunity in gen 7 (83:19 - 83:21)
considering the island theme sorry for (83:21 - 83:23)
the long email but I thought it would be (83:23 - 83:24)
a good discussion to have from you guys (83:24 - 83:25)
and maybe you could do a fossil Pokemon (83:25 - 83:27)
the week sometime Mastodon thanks for (83:27 - 83:30)
all the great work you do Joe so just (83:30 - 83:33)
from a purely legal perspective and (83:33 - 83:35)
you'll have to forgive me a little bit (83:35 - 83:37)
because it's been at least 15 years (83:37 - 83:40)
since I've looked at the stuff legally (83:40 - 83:43)
um there's a world of and these are (83:43 - 83:46)
distinct legal terms trademark copyright (83:46 - 83:48)
and trade secret that you have to (83:48 - 83:52)
protect in different ways I don't think (83:52 - 83:54)
you can ever lose copyright but (83:54 - 83:57)
trademarks which tend to be characters (83:57 - 84:00)
that are emblematic of the brand that (84:00 - 84:03)
you are selling you have to continually (84:03 - 84:05)
legally protect or you lose them so the (84:05 - 84:09)
classic example of this is people (84:09 - 84:11)
complain when the Disney Company sues (84:11 - 84:14)
daycare centers that have Disney (84:14 - 84:16)
characters painted on their walls but (84:16 - 84:18)
the thing is if Disney did not sue those (84:18 - 84:21)
daycare centers then anybody could put (84:21 - 84:24)
Disney characters anywhere because you (84:24 - 84:27)
know the other people can say well you (84:27 - 84:29)
let these people have it in their area (84:29 - 84:31)
and so if you're letting them do it for (84:31 - 84:34)
free then we can do it for free yeah (84:34 - 84:36)
it's the same with like Nintendo and (84:36 - 84:39)
that Metroid game that they took down (84:39 - 84:40)
yeah fans complain that this Nintendo (84:40 - 84:44)
should have just bought it and they (84:44 - 84:45)
should incorporate it and then turn it (84:45 - 84:47)
into an actual Metroid game like the (84:47 - 84:48)
game was done they could just do that (84:48 - 84:50)
but if they were to agree and they were (84:50 - 84:52)
to do that then they're not actually (84:52 - 84:56)
protecting their IP and therefore in the (84:56 - 85:00)
future like will said with the Disney (85:00 - 85:02)
the next person could come along (85:02 - 85:04)
and make a Metroid game and call it (85:04 - 85:06)
Metroid and Nintendo couldn't do (85:06 - 85:10)
anything to that they couldn't (85:10 - 85:11)
cease-and-desist it they couldn't ask (85:11 - 85:13)
for it take down because they initially (85:13 - 85:15)
didn't protect their copyright the first (85:15 - 85:18)
time and so that's why a lot of the (85:18 - 85:20)
times you see companies that that go (85:20 - 85:22)
like don't don't send us fan stuff like (85:22 - 85:25)
we can't look at it because if we look (85:25 - 85:27)
at it and we we somehow get inspiration (85:27 - 85:30)
from that then you can you can claim (85:30 - 85:33)
that it was yours and blah blah blah and (85:33 - 85:34)
so it's just like this very messy (85:34 - 85:36)
situation so the easiest thing for a (85:36 - 85:40)
company do to is just say hey remove (85:40 - 85:42)
that yeah and also in this Pokemon (85:42 - 85:45)
uranium version from what I can see it's (85:45 - 85:47)
they literally use the Pokemon font and (85:47 - 85:50)
the Pokemon word of uranium version and (85:50 - 85:53)
if all of the gameplay and everything is (85:53 - 85:56)
based on the same mechanics or pay maybe (85:56 - 86:00)
like a reverse engineered version of the (86:00 - 86:02)
games then that's just theft but yeah I (86:02 - 86:08)
mean ah it's it's like a beautiful (86:08 - 86:10)
little love letter but I mean okay (86:10 - 86:14)
Pokemon uranium from what I know about (86:14 - 86:16)
it which is not much but they had one (86:16 - 86:18)
good idea which is that there's a well I (86:18 - 86:20)
I don't know they could have lots of (86:20 - 86:22)
good ideas but one idea that I thought (86:22 - 86:24)
was very interesting was they have an (86:24 - 86:25)
additional type in it which is like (86:25 - 86:27)
radioactive type something huh so no not (86:27 - 86:31)
this time (86:31 - 86:32)
but radioactive which radioactive is (86:32 - 86:34)
like super effective against all types (86:34 - 86:36)
and all types are super effective (86:36 - 86:38)
against it which I thought was a very (86:38 - 86:41)
interesting little mechanic but yeah (86:41 - 86:44)
this is literally just Pokemon you can't (86:44 - 86:46)
just steal you can't just read the title (86:46 - 86:50)
and then release that it's also (86:50 - 86:52)
something where they're you know like (86:52 - 86:55)
free advertising is kind of up in the (86:55 - 86:56)
air because it's not really if you play (86:56 - 86:59)
through this game you like this was this (86:59 - 87:02)
was released around the same time as (87:02 - 87:04)
similar graphical stuff was being put (87:04 - 87:07)
out like black and white to I think is (87:07 - 87:09)
that correct I don't know any (87:09 - 87:11)
I know he came out 2016 last year yeah (87:11 - 87:15)
are you serious okay well they were (87:15 - 87:16)
working on it for a long time then six (87:16 - 87:18)
um yeah but it looks exactly like like a (87:18 - 87:24)
black and white - or something (87:24 - 87:25)
so if somebody play's that they're (87:25 - 87:28)
actually less likely to want to go pick (87:28 - 87:30)
up another Pokemon game unless it like (87:30 - 87:32)
really struck them but for most people (87:32 - 87:33)
it's going to just scratch that itch and (87:33 - 87:35)
they're done and they won't spend any (87:35 - 87:36)
money on I'm talking about stuff in (87:36 - 87:38)
addition to all the stuff that will end (87:38 - 87:40)
Steve listed which is you've got to (87:40 - 87:42)
protect your own copyright or everybody (87:42 - 87:44)
can just have it (87:44 - 87:46)
yeah and that's like the worst thing III (87:46 - 87:49)
think we can all agree that's the worst (87:49 - 87:51)
thing about intellectual property law is (87:51 - 87:53)
it puts the burden on the person who's (87:53 - 87:56)
intellectual property is being abused to (87:56 - 88:00)
defend it or they lose it rather than (88:00 - 88:02)
putting a punishment that on somebody (88:02 - 88:05)
who's clearly infringing intellectual (88:05 - 88:07)
property well they're I mean there's (88:07 - 88:09)
there's tons of bad things about (88:09 - 88:10)
electoral property law but well no I of (88:10 - 88:13)
course and it always favorable it it's (88:13 - 88:15)
never gonna be clear-cut then I I just (88:15 - 88:17)
there is no way intellectual property (88:17 - 88:20)
law is ever going to be clear-cut it (88:20 - 88:21)
will always have to be debated and there (88:21 - 88:23)
will always be hurt feelings I don't you (88:23 - 88:25)
know how the the pixel mod 'minecraft (88:25 - 88:29)
works and why it's why it's still a (88:29 - 88:31)
thing I mean it's probably it's probably (88:31 - 88:35)
extremely different enough - yeah (88:35 - 88:39)
it's like I mean the battle system might (88:39 - 88:41)
mimic Pokemon but it is not literally (88:41 - 88:43)
two creatures facing off against each (88:43 - 88:45)
other with HP bars and stuff I mean yo (88:45 - 88:47)
for making Lois it's crummy minecraft (88:47 - 88:52)
right the quality yeah there's not I (88:52 - 88:54)
mean I recently had this discussion with (88:54 - 88:57)
one of my co-workers because I and I (88:57 - 88:59)
apologized I know many people in our (88:59 - 89:02)
community are huge Minecraft fans I (89:02 - 89:05)
cannot comprehend why anyone would spend (89:05 - 89:09)
more than two minutes playing Minecraft (89:09 - 89:12)
so it's like us except that they're you (89:12 - 89:16)
don't touch I mean I hold what you're (89:16 - 89:19)
saying to me when people say it's just (89:19 - 89:20)
Legos is like that there could be a (89:20 - 89:22)
virtual knitting game where I'm like (89:22 - 89:24)
make (89:24 - 89:25)
virtual blankets and clothes for people (89:25 - 89:28)
through knitting action no you know what (89:28 - 89:30)
I knit because I make something real (89:30 - 89:32)
it's it's more like it's like like (89:32 - 89:35)
Photoshop is what you're looking for (89:35 - 89:36)
there and lots of people love Photoshop (89:36 - 89:38)
like the ganic but then you can print (89:38 - 89:40)
the photos if I was a kid though that my (89:40 - 89:43)
biggest problem as a kid and I'm just (89:43 - 89:45)
trying to play devil's advocate here is (89:45 - 89:47)
that I never had enough Legos and so to (89:47 - 89:51)
have a computer game that could give me (89:51 - 89:54)
unlimited Lego so I could build you know (89:54 - 89:57)
a 2 million piece Pikachu as tall as I (89:57 - 90:02)
want like that's something I could never (90:02 - 90:04)
actually do in real life because my (90:04 - 90:05)
parents were poor and racist as we (90:05 - 90:07)
learned (90:07 - 90:09)
everybody knows races do not get like is (90:09 - 90:11)
I mean maybe I'm just just from two (90:11 - 90:15)
different of perspectives having you (90:15 - 90:18)
know spent my childhood in Hawaii most (90:18 - 90:20)
of the time it was very comfortable and (90:20 - 90:22)
easy to be outdoors and I did outdoors (90:22 - 90:24)
stuff and I wasn't sitting there (90:24 - 90:27)
although I did have Legos but I just (90:27 - 90:29)
wasn't spending all my time playing with (90:29 - 90:31)
piles of Legos you know I'd be out in (90:31 - 90:33)
the pool or walking around the (90:33 - 90:35)
neighborhood doing jump rope with my (90:35 - 90:36)
friends it was also the 70s we didn't (90:36 - 90:38)
have computers Oh as a kid who didn't do (90:38 - 90:43)
a lot of stuff outside and pretty much (90:43 - 90:45)
only played video games I think there's (90:45 - 90:47)
a lot of like you said you can you can (90:47 - 90:50)
print out the thing that you made on (90:50 - 90:52)
Photoshop like (90:52 - 90:54)
you can also not I mean I don't think (90:54 - 90:57)
that anything needs to have a physical (90:57 - 90:58)
component to be worthwhile or fun I mean (90:58 - 91:01)
that's that's a huge division between us (91:01 - 91:03)
right i I if I'm going to spend my time (91:03 - 91:07)
and this is specifically if I'm going to (91:07 - 91:09)
spend my time building something if I'm (91:09 - 91:12)
going to spend my time doing creation I (91:12 - 91:14)
want there to be a physical (91:14 - 91:15)
manifestation of it so you don't want to (91:15 - 91:17)
stay really hard and lost and you took (91:17 - 91:21)
do something build something you would (91:21 - 91:24)
want compensation no I would want to be (91:24 - 91:27)
able much like the Pokemon art that I (91:27 - 91:29)
have hanging on the walls of my house (91:29 - 91:31)
and the Destiny art that I have I want (91:31 - 91:33)
to be able to frame it and hang it on my (91:33 - 91:35)
wall like I do and I can look over and (91:35 - 91:37)
I'm like oh look at that cute but art of (91:37 - 91:40)
a guru an azure remark that somebody (91:40 - 91:42)
made and I have framed hanging right (91:42 - 91:44)
there that I can look at and touch if I (91:44 - 91:46)
want to touch it (91:46 - 91:47)
that's not like you can't be turned off (91:47 - 91:50)
when the computer gets turned off well (91:50 - 91:51)
see it's weird because sure you don't (91:51 - 91:54)
have exactly that but in a way you can (91:54 - 91:57)
share it with many many many other (91:57 - 91:59)
people in the world and they can (91:59 - 92:00)
experience it in a way they wouldn't be (92:00 - 92:02)
able to from just a photograph in (92:02 - 92:03)
Minecraft like if you shares anything I (92:03 - 92:06)
hate it is sharing I got to not like to (92:06 - 92:10)
share let's I just say like clear that (92:10 - 92:13)
so just like yesterday somebody posted a (92:13 - 92:16)
video where somebody someone had made (92:16 - 92:18)
all of Hogwarts in Minecraft and you (92:18 - 92:23)
know like if you want to you can go you (92:23 - 92:26)
can download that world and walk around (92:26 - 92:28)
at Hogwarts and that's a thing that a (92:28 - 92:31)
you couldn't do because it's cost (92:31 - 92:32)
prohibitive (92:32 - 92:33)
how many Lego bricks it would take be (92:33 - 92:35)
there would only be one version of it so (92:35 - 92:38)
nobody apply for a job at Legoland and (92:38 - 92:41)
make a Legoland hogwarts model yeah but (92:41 - 92:44)
ran so the order one others might might (92:44 - 92:47)
file intellectual property rights and (92:47 - 92:49)
then you'd have to take the leg goes (92:49 - 92:51)
down no it's it's like isn't like a land (92:51 - 92:53)
in like Germany they have no (92:53 - 92:54)
intellectual property lawyers now (92:54 - 92:56)
there's a Legoland in California's (92:56 - 92:58)
they're not I don't know (92:58 - 93:00)
never been before now I'm pretty sure (93:00 - 93:01)
there is I think here's a Legoland and (93:01 - 93:03)
it's somewhere the United States the (93:03 - 93:05)
second question here is (93:05 - 93:07)
how do you feel about no fossils being (93:07 - 93:09)
in Sun Moon there are fossils in sun and (93:09 - 93:12)
moon letting go to the guy you gotta the (93:12 - 93:14)
jurassic park trailer guy yeah it was oh (93:14 - 93:17)
wow that's fine yeah can I'm not I'm not (93:17 - 93:21)
in love with with fossils or the brush (93:21 - 93:24)
yeah you know they couldn't fit him they (93:24 - 93:26)
couldn't fit him and I wouldn't want (93:26 - 93:27)
something forced into the game of like (93:27 - 93:30)
oh we need to have fossil cuz every (93:30 - 93:32)
other game has had fossils I take when I (93:32 - 93:35)
go deep floor for you guys oh go for it (93:35 - 93:37)
right no fossils in Hawaii there are no (93:37 - 93:40)
fossils in Hawaii because they're (93:40 - 93:41)
volcanic islands and they are relatively (93:41 - 93:45)
new land quote quote geologically (93:45 - 93:47)
speaking so that there would not be (93:47 - 93:49)
sedimentary fossils found in the (93:49 - 93:51)
sediment of the islands boom will with (93:51 - 93:54)
the science on you ending on that (93:54 - 93:57)
volcano note ah let me run down Pokemon (93:57 - 94:01)
the week real quick again no Travis (94:01 - 94:04)
Logan's a little bit competitive so if (94:04 - 94:06)
you want to chime in you're more than (94:06 - 94:07)
welcome to this is it one of those six (94:07 - 94:09)
pokémon that are on my team right now (94:09 - 94:11)
no it's not it's not agate link we might (94:11 - 94:14)
have done this one before but I picked (94:14 - 94:16)
gastro down this week Gaston is is in (94:16 - 94:22)
the top something of competitive good (94:22 - 94:25)
old my confidence right there the top (94:25 - 94:27)
something I know gas drums still being (94:27 - 94:28)
used it was used in the past (94:28 - 94:29)
competitively so I figured it would be a (94:29 - 94:32)
okay choice for those interested in (94:32 - 94:33)
using gastro down the move said I have (94:33 - 94:36)
here from our slack community shout out (94:36 - 94:39)
to Kevin for providing this Kevin always (94:39 - 94:41)
on top of the moves or the the move the (94:41 - 94:45)
the loadouts don't know if they're 100 (94:45 - 94:47)
percent accurate or not but I trust his (94:47 - 94:49)
judgment we have a sassy nature 252 and (94:49 - 94:52)
HP 104 in defense 152 in special defense (94:52 - 94:57)
C when you split it like that I feel (94:57 - 94:59)
like they know what they're talking (94:59 - 95:01)
about (95:01 - 95:01)
I insurance it's built a survive a (95:01 - 95:05)
specific attack from a specific one yeah (95:05 - 95:07)
they cal count the amount of damage that (95:07 - 95:09)
it's like biggest threat is going to do (95:09 - 95:10)
and then that's why you can that's why (95:10 - 95:13)
you can trust these move sets uh idle (95:13 - 95:15)
moves leftovers ability as storm drain (95:15 - 95:18)
with the moves (95:18 - 95:19)
scold toxic and Rick (95:19 - 95:21)
and then for your fourth move you have (95:21 - 95:23)
you have a couple options you can either (95:23 - 95:25)
go with secret power you can go with ice (95:25 - 95:28)
beam you can go with sludge bomb or you (95:28 - 95:30)
can go with earth power so whichever (95:30 - 95:32)
whichever ones fits your loadout a (95:32 - 95:34)
little bit of customization there but (95:34 - 95:36)
the first three are scold toxic and (95:36 - 95:38)
recover and again this this will be able (95:38 - 95:41)
to be used in double battles Kevin's (95:41 - 95:43)
right up is gastro down is a special (95:43 - 95:44)
tank the first three moves served cause (95:44 - 95:47)
status and keep living the last move can (95:47 - 95:50)
be brought in for coverage for can be (95:50 - 95:52)
brought in for coverage or you could (95:52 - 95:53)
just default to protect storm drains (95:53 - 95:55)
heals you if you are hit by a water (95:55 - 95:57)
types so he is also great if you have a (95:57 - 96:00)
fire type Pokemon like our k9 and you (96:00 - 96:02)
think you're going to get slammed by a (96:02 - 96:03)
water type move the storm drain sucks in (96:03 - 96:06)
all the water abilities so it keeps (96:06 - 96:07)
Pokemon like our k9 safe yeah so I think (96:07 - 96:11)
if somebody tries to attack you with (96:11 - 96:12)
water then the water actually diverts (96:12 - 96:14)
and goes over to gastro Don and then (96:14 - 96:16)
gastrin on heals get forces all single (96:16 - 96:18)
target water moves to strike the book (96:18 - 96:20)
Mountains ability and rather than doing (96:20 - 96:22)
damage it heals them and if you get a (96:22 - 96:24)
shiny gastro Don it is a puke green who (96:24 - 96:28)
are both of them because there's two (96:28 - 96:31)
different colors of gastro Don yeah (96:31 - 96:33)
there's a pink and a blue yeah depending (96:33 - 96:35)
on which side of the island you get it (96:35 - 96:36)
from there's a pink and a blue both (96:36 - 96:38)
their tops so like the pink one has a (96:38 - 96:41)
brown top and the blue the blue one has (96:41 - 96:42)
a green top both their tops turn into (96:42 - 96:45)
like this puke brown greenish color yeah (96:45 - 96:48)
it's really not for him it's really (96:48 - 96:51)
really not I mean they're slugs so I (96:51 - 96:53)
guess it kind of works like but I mean (96:53 - 96:55)
the pink one just gets strictly worse as (96:55 - 96:58)
yeah that's true that's true why I would (96:58 - 97:01)
say they both get worst look cuz they're (97:01 - 97:03)
both the blue and the pink are really (97:03 - 97:04)
vibrant and then they just get so muted (97:04 - 97:06)
it looks like it looks like they were (97:06 - 97:08)
plushies that you sat in the Sun for a (97:08 - 97:10)
very long time at some trivia here all (97:10 - 97:14)
according to an interview it with (97:14 - 97:17)
Nintendo Power Ken Sugimori (97:17 - 97:18)
shallows and gastro Don were originally (97:18 - 97:21)
intended for pokemon ruby and sapphire (97:21 - 97:23)
but were not implemented due to time (97:23 - 97:25)
constraints both the shallows and gastro (97:25 - 97:28)
Don have early sprites within the game (97:28 - 97:30)
data of diamond and pearl however there (97:30 - 97:32)
are no front sprites these forms (97:32 - 97:35)
in pokemon diamond and pearl no in-game (97:35 - 97:36)
trainer uses East Sea gastro Don in (97:36 - 97:39)
battle even on the side of Mount Cornett (97:39 - 97:42)
and pokemon platinum all trainers east (97:42 - 97:44)
side of Mount Cornett have East Sea (97:44 - 97:46)
gastro Don prior two generations six (97:46 - 97:50)
gastro Don's body style was this aunt (97:50 - 97:53)
looking thing I don't know that means (97:53 - 97:58)
it's probably to see it use good ol (97:58 - 98:03)
Bobby pedia (98:03 - 98:05)
but there yeah that's it let some gastro (98:05 - 98:08)
done love if you're going into some (98:08 - 98:10)
competitive's might be a good choice so (98:10 - 98:11)
to speak more on that okay so first of (98:11 - 98:13)
all I'm you guys always talk about calyx (98:13 - 98:16)
I don't know if everybody listening (98:16 - 98:19)
actually understands what that actually (98:19 - 98:21)
it's from or means can I go into that (98:21 - 98:23)
for a little bit sure so if you you can (98:23 - 98:26)
just search Pokemon calculator on Google (98:26 - 98:27)
but it's Pokemon showdown comm slash (98:27 - 98:29)
damage calc and it has basically the a (98:29 - 98:33)
bunch of selectors where you can select (98:33 - 98:36)
your Pokemon or the Pokemon that you're (98:36 - 98:37)
going to Train and then the Pokemon you (98:37 - 98:40)
want to survive their attack from so (98:40 - 98:42)
anybody who's currently top of the meta (98:42 - 98:44)
like so maybe you want to survive type (98:44 - 98:46)
of cuckoos thunder this isn't a good (98:46 - 98:48)
example for gastro Don um what about (98:48 - 98:51)
taboo bulu you want to survive an attack (98:51 - 98:54)
from taboo bulu because you get rain or (98:54 - 98:56)
something right like because you're (98:56 - 98:58)
you're four times weak to that as gastro (98:58 - 99:00)
Don and but maybe there's a build (99:00 - 99:01)
because he's pretty tanky maybe there's (99:01 - 99:03)
a build where you still end up with 1 hp (99:03 - 99:05)
this is all based on math and the (99:05 - 99:08)
Pokemon can do a little bit more a (99:08 - 99:09)
little bit less whenever it hits with an (99:09 - 99:10)
attack but you can make your V's that (99:10 - 99:15)
you give to your Pokemon such that it (99:15 - 99:18)
has just like 1 hp more than the maximum (99:18 - 99:21)
amount that taboo bula can do and the (99:21 - 99:24)
way to plan that out is to go to this (99:24 - 99:26)
damage calculator and put the foot both (99:26 - 99:29)
hook'em on in against each other and (99:29 - 99:31)
then it shows like all their moves and (99:31 - 99:32)
what they would do to the other one it's (99:32 - 99:34)
it's a super handy tool and when people (99:34 - 99:36)
make very specific builds like those (99:36 - 99:38)
DUHS that Eevee spread that that Steve (99:38 - 99:41)
listed for this one that's where they (99:41 - 99:42)
get these from it's it's a very specific (99:42 - 99:45)
amount of EVs that are trying to make (99:45 - 99:48)
your Pokemon survive versus whatever (99:48 - 99:52)
specific hit yes and if you are confused (99:52 - 99:55)
earlier about the trivia East Sea gastro (99:55 - 99:58)
downs are blue and green West sea gastro (99:58 - 100:02)
downs are pink and brown yeah there's I (100:02 - 100:04)
don't think there's any difference in (100:04 - 100:05)
the rain just knitting ah just yeah how (100:05 - 100:08)
they look and I didn't even realize it (100:08 - 100:10)
but body style is actually a thing you (100:10 - 100:12)
can search on in your pokedex when (100:12 - 100:14)
