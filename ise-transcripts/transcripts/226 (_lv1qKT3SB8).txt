and we are back from our break I have a (0:00 - 0:06)
special guest with with us today (0:04 - 0:08)
actually you guys probably already know (0:06 - 0:09)
cuz I probably would have said it in the (0:08 - 0:12)
intro here but the magic of recording I (0:09 - 0:14)
am inserting this into our episode but I (0:12 - 0:17)
have Dan Reichert here from Giant Bomb (0:14 - 0:21)
more importantly Pokemon expert Pokemon (0:17 - 0:24)
expert 101 Dan record my business card (0:21 - 0:28)
says yeah the number one Pokemon fan at (0:24 - 0:33)
Giant Bomb right I mean maybe I don't (0:28 - 0:34)
know how many Pokemon fans there are (0:33 - 0:37)
there I don't talk about it a lot I (0:34 - 0:38)
don't know well you guys have been (0:37 - 0:39)
talking about it a little bit more (0:38 - 0:41)
because of Pokemon go yeah of course I (0:39 - 0:43)
mean we can't be video game podcast and (0:41 - 0:45)
they ignore that phenomenon so obviously (0:43 - 0:47)
it's been coming up recently but as far (0:45 - 0:49)
as the the classic games I don't know if (0:47 - 0:52)
we have like a major Pokemon editor (0:49 - 0:54)
Austin Walker I believe played some of (0:52 - 0:56)
the old games but I may be the most (0:54 - 0:58)
experienced Pokemon editor now I'm not (0:56 - 1:00)
sure that's awesome I have a ton of (0:58 - 1:02)
questions for you but before we go into (1:00 - 1:04)
this do you want to just give a little (1:02 - 1:07)
summary of who you are besides the fact (1:04 - 1:09)
that you work at Giant Bomb who is Dan (1:07 - 1:14)
record boy to serve that kind of a (1:09 - 1:18)
all-purpose Internet idiot lots of I (1:14 - 1:20)
mean if you I'm sure just a Google (1:18 - 1:22)
search my name would come up with dozens (1:20 - 1:24)
and dozens of just dumb things I've done (1:22 - 1:26)
whether on my own or when I worked a (1:24 - 1:29)
Game Informer now I work a Giant Bomb (1:26 - 1:31)
written a few books a couple of them (1:29 - 1:34)
were super silly books one of them was (1:31 - 1:36)
more of a serious one and now I'm kind (1:34 - 1:37)
of working on a more autobiographical (1:36 - 1:41)
one of kind of funny stories I'm a pro (1:37 - 1:43)
wrestling manager here in Northern (1:41 - 1:45)
California I'm a bad guy tag team (1:43 - 1:48)
manager that's kind of the broad strokes (1:45 - 1:52)
that say okay alright uh I I prepped you (1:48 - 1:54)
earlier but we were gonna start off with (1:52 - 1:56)
some Pokemon questions and then we'll (1:54 - 1:58)
probably go way off topic from that but (1:56 - 2:00)
that's totally cool that's er anytime we (1:58 - 2:02)
interview somebody like when we (2:00 - 2:03)
interviewed Austin creator only we (2:02 - 2:05)
interviewed J wits it was rarely about (2:03 - 2:07)
Pokemon but if we're talking about (2:05 - 2:09)
Austin Creed if I can direct some of (2:07 - 2:11)
your listeners if you just say YouTube (2:09 - 2:13)
it was on his show up up down down (2:11 - 2:15)
I played against him in Soul Calibur (2:13 - 2:18)
with some stakes for the losers so if (2:15 - 2:20)
you want to look up Dan record versus (2:18 - 2:22)
Austin Creed's Soul Calibur I'm pretty (2:20 - 2:24)
happy with how that turned out okay all (2:22 - 2:24)
right (2:24 - 2:26)
did you guys ever do your Mario Kart (2:24 - 2:29)
Double Dash thing no he backed out okay (2:26 - 2:32)
he a year prior to PAX East told me that (2:29 - 2:34)
he had requested off and everything he (2:32 - 2:36)
was set for Boston he was ready to go (2:34 - 2:38)
but then he had to go become one of the (2:36 - 2:41)
biggest acts in the company and instead (2:38 - 2:42)
it's a little harder to get off work (2:41 - 2:44)
when we were the tag team champions and (2:42 - 2:46)
incredibly popular so we had to go over (2:44 - 2:48)
to Europe and he missed facts East I (2:46 - 2:50)
when I spent the day with him I forgot (2:48 - 2:51)
to bring that up because I feel like I'm (2:50 - 2:53)
also pretty good at double dash and I (2:51 - 2:54)
feel like I could even take him I don't (2:53 - 2:56)
know what his his double dash skills are (2:54 - 2:58)
though well he's good yeah here's the (2:56 - 3:02)
thing he man he has made this whole (2:58 - 3:04)
campaign about how I'm lying about what (3:02 - 3:06)
happened WrestleMania weekend San (3:04 - 3:08)
Francisco last year but the (3:06 - 3:10)
honest-to-god truth story this is not an (3:08 - 3:13)
act is that we set up a Mario Kart (3:10 - 3:15)
Double Dash tournament at a video game (3:13 - 3:17)
bar here near where Wrestlemania was (3:15 - 3:19)
last year in the Bay Area and we set up (3:17 - 3:22)
16 players me Austin Creed we're in (3:19 - 3:26)
there one of the WWE referees Jason (3:22 - 3:27)
hires and then a bunch of random people (3:26 - 3:29)
that we found at the bar I asked Roddy (3:27 - 3:32)
Piper I asked a hacksaw jim duggan that (3:29 - 3:35)
they benefit but but yeah in the finals (3:32 - 3:38)
it was there were four of us and me and (3:35 - 3:41)
Austin were in the finals and I won at (3:38 - 3:45)
the double - yes I beat Xavier / Austin (3:41 - 3:48)
that is the true story there and I don't (3:45 - 3:50)
claim to be necessarily great at that (3:48 - 3:52)
game I played a ton of it in college I (3:50 - 3:54)
played all the mario cards to death but (3:52 - 3:56)
the fact of the matter is I did beat him (3:54 - 3:58)
but we didn't have it on tape or (3:56 - 3:59)
anything we weren't streaming it so he (3:58 - 4:01)
was it was very easy for him to go on (3:59 - 4:02)
Twitter and twitch in a show and (4:01 - 4:05)
everything and say never happened okay (4:02 - 4:06)
right now honestly got a true story I (4:05 - 4:09)
beat him all right all right we'll keep (4:06 - 4:12)
record here let's dive into things yeah (4:09 - 4:15)
since you are since you are the Pokemon (4:12 - 4:17)
expert let's I want to test your (4:15 - 4:18)
knowledge real quick with one question (4:17 - 4:20)
how many Pokemon do you think there are (4:18 - 4:23)
currently eight hundred Wow actually (4:20 - 4:25)
you're pretty close right yeah there are (4:23 - 4:26)
720 (4:25 - 4:29)
one officially and so far the Pokemon (4:26 - 4:32)
company has shown up 25 new ones so (4:29 - 4:33)
probably when the new games come out (4:32 - 4:36)
we'll have 800 at that point okay so I (4:33 - 4:37)
was kind of ballpark I know about that (4:36 - 4:40)
you know the 150 slice 151 early on and (4:37 - 4:42)
I know they've added on with all the the (4:40 - 4:44)
different ones so I actually had to (4:42 - 4:46)
research a bunch of Pokemon stuff (4:44 - 4:49)
recently because my girlfriend told me a (4:46 - 4:51)
story about when she was in like fifth (4:49 - 4:53)
or sixth grade or something she had a (4:51 - 4:55)
bunch of holographic Pokemon cards and (4:53 - 4:57)
like two sleeves folding so there's 18 (4:55 - 5:00)
of them and some kid in her class stole (4:57 - 5:01)
them she took them from class to to show (5:00 - 5:03)
em off cuz she was so proud of all of (5:01 - 5:05)
her holographic cards and they got (5:03 - 5:07)
stolen and I was so like devastated (5:05 - 5:08)
hearing that us I mean who could do that (5:07 - 5:10)
to you when your instance and isn't a (5:08 - 5:11)
little kid like I was so mad about that (5:10 - 5:14)
story so I like kinda stealthily was (5:11 - 5:15)
asking her about the different cards she (5:14 - 5:16)
had because I didn't know enough about (5:15 - 5:18)
Pokemon and so I was writing while down (5:16 - 5:20)
secretly without telling her and I went (5:18 - 5:22)
to all these different eBay sellers and (5:20 - 5:23)
everything and I bought them one by one (5:22 - 5:25)
and about a couple sleeves and I and I (5:23 - 5:27)
returned her stolen Pokemon card Stuart (5:25 - 5:32)
such an amazing story she was very happy (5:27 - 5:35)
how many you do you have all the Pokemon (5:32 - 5:37)
amiibos oh man they're right in the (5:35 - 5:40)
other room I've got actually you know (5:37 - 5:42)
what yeah I think I do I might not have (5:40 - 5:45)
a loose sorry oh I have Jigglypuff I (5:42 - 5:49)
have a Pikachu Charizard greninja I'm it (5:45 - 5:51)
greninja faced the corner because I (5:49 - 5:53)
think he looks stupid (5:51 - 5:56)
what else are there I think loose REO (5:53 - 5:57)
might be knowing when I don't have it I (5:56 - 5:59)
might even have that I've kind of think (5:57 - 6:02)
I think you named him aww yeah Mewtwo (5:59 - 6:07)
Charizard Jigglypuff lucario lucario no (6:02 - 6:09)
that's alright I the the the joke on the (6:07 - 6:11)
show is I butcher a lot of pokémon names (6:09 - 6:14)
so my listeners use that against me (6:11 - 6:16)
well I've heard from drying bomb fans (6:14 - 6:17)
that I mispronounced even the word (6:16 - 6:20)
Pokemon I think I say pokemons and it (6:17 - 6:23)
says it technically Pokemon how do I say (6:20 - 6:26)
it Pokemon poster okay and I say pokey (6:23 - 6:29)
yeah yeah so I'll probably mess that up (6:26 - 6:30)
throughout that's all right you can't (6:29 - 6:31)
can't win them all what what's your (6:30 - 6:34)
what's your favorite Pokemon do you have (6:31 - 6:34)
one (6:34 - 6:37)
oh man like the longest time the only (6:34 - 6:38)
ones I knew at all who were from Smash (6:37 - 6:40)
Brothers (6:38 - 6:42)
I favor one it would have to be (6:40 - 6:43)
something from smash four because I'm in (6:42 - 6:45)
charge are it's pretty cool I like him (6:43 - 6:46)
yeah yeah you can't go wrong with a (6:45 - 6:50)
dragon yeah yeah my sister is a big (6:46 - 6:51)
Pokemon fan and she told me that there's (6:50 - 6:53)
one that's just a literal pile of trash (6:51 - 6:56)
now is it gruba sh4 trubbish trubbish (6:53 - 7:00)
yeah and it evolves into garbo odor okay (6:56 - 7:01)
maybe that one that's kind of funny to (7:00 - 7:05)
me no that's really cool pile of trash I (7:01 - 7:07)
don't know I would say probably (7:05 - 7:09)
Charizard I mean I like Pikachu as well (7:07 - 7:11)
he's a you know if you play games at all (7:09 - 7:12)
you got to be somewhat familiar with (7:11 - 7:14)
Pikachu even if you don't play pokemon (7:12 - 7:16)
games i like Snorlax he seems like a (7:14 - 7:18)
cool guy yeah do you know there's a (7:16 - 7:21)
there before Snorlax there's a pokémon (7:18 - 7:24)
called munchlax and all he does is eat (7:21 - 7:25)
and then eventually evolves into Snorlax (7:24 - 7:28)
is he like a skinny version or is he fat (7:25 - 7:30)
from the beginning uh he's a little (7:28 - 7:32)
chubbier but he's he's really tiny (7:30 - 7:34)
compared to snow relax okay so it's like (7:32 - 7:36)
once he gets it's like that's the (7:34 - 7:38)
Pokemon version of catching diabetes do (7:36 - 7:39)
you eat too much and you get too big and (7:38 - 7:41)
then you become a Snorlax (7:39 - 7:43)
right yeah and then all you do is sleep (7:41 - 7:46)
and eat and sleep just being instead of (7:43 - 7:48)
just eating that sounds alright (7:46 - 7:52)
thumbs up America pretty well yeah move (7:48 - 7:53)
on to some more serious questions the (7:52 - 7:56)
first one starting so you're at Giant (7:53 - 7:57)
Bomb now you mentioned before you were (7:56 - 7:59)
at Game Informer yeah you moved across (7:57 - 8:02)
the country for that so how different is (7:59 - 8:05)
life it's a tremendously different uh (8:02 - 8:06)
you know we talked a little bit before (8:05 - 8:07)
we started recording here you're from (8:06 - 8:10)
the Midwest as well you know I grew up (8:07 - 8:13)
in Kansas I moved to Minnesota for for (8:10 - 8:14)
Game Informer and so I was very much (8:13 - 8:17)
used to that kind of like semis suburban (8:14 - 8:18)
but still kind of close to a big enough (8:17 - 8:22)
city you know area and so moving out (8:18 - 8:25)
here to San Francisco where everything (8:22 - 8:26)
is different I mean it's I'm looking at (8:25 - 8:28)
the ocean right now on my window which (8:26 - 8:29)
is crazy because I didn't see the ocean (8:28 - 8:31)
ever till I was like 26 years old or (8:29 - 8:32)
something now I see it every morning (8:31 - 8:35)
when I wake up you know I just I sold my (8:32 - 8:36)
car within like two months and moving (8:35 - 8:38)
out here because I've never lived in an (8:36 - 8:41)
area with public transportation and now (8:38 - 8:42)
it's like I lived here for a couple (8:41 - 8:44)
months since I'm not driving anywhere I (8:42 - 8:47)
might as well just sell it and take the (8:44 - 8:49)
bus everywhere so that's a totally new (8:47 - 8:51)
thing but it's it's a lot of changes (8:49 - 8:53)
some good some bad (8:51 - 8:55)
but overall I mean I wouldn't take back (8:53 - 8:57)
the decision in a million years I love (8:55 - 8:59)
working a Giant Bomb I've come to love (8:57 - 9:00)
San Francisco (8:59 - 9:02)
well maybe love is a strong word I love (9:00 - 9:04)
my life in San Francisco I've got a (9:02 - 9:05)
really good job I've got a good friend (9:04 - 9:07)
Circle got this and this girlfriend that (9:05 - 9:10)
I'm in love with here it's just it's a (9:07 - 9:12)
good life right now so I'm very happy (9:10 - 9:12)
here (9:12 - 9:14)
that's awesome can you talk about the (9:12 - 9:16)
first time you met Jeff and the rest of (9:14 - 9:18)
the giant bomb crew I don't know if that (9:16 - 9:20)
story was ever told but obviously you (9:18 - 9:22)
moved across the country so you must (9:20 - 9:25)
have had some good relationship with (9:22 - 9:27)
Jeff before that happened yeah I did the (9:25 - 9:31)
technical first time I met him was III I (9:27 - 9:33)
want to say Oh 8:00 and there's actually (9:31 - 9:35)
a picture of me meeting him because at (9:33 - 9:37)
this time you know I was not in the (9:35 - 9:39)
industry I was a college student I was (9:37 - 9:41)
writing for my towns like kind of (9:39 - 9:43)
college paper reviewing videogames and (9:41 - 9:45)
paying my way out to e3 every year just (9:43 - 9:46)
trying to get connections and see all (9:45 - 9:48)
the new games and report on him and so I (9:46 - 9:50)
was just a fan you know I knew Jeff from (9:48 - 9:52)
the GameSpot days and everything and (9:50 - 9:55)
this was right after the whole I came in (9:52 - 9:56)
Lynch controversy and everything the (9:55 - 9:58)
whole firing from GameSpot and he was (9:56 - 10:00)
just starting up Giant Bomb at this time (9:58 - 10:02)
when I first met him and there's a (10:00 - 10:04)
picture of me and my dorky Lawrence calm (10:02 - 10:06)
shirt and I got a fan picture with him (10:04 - 10:07)
and I went up to him and I said oh (10:06 - 10:08)
you're a great girl (10:07 - 10:11)
he was like actually Jeff Carson I (10:08 - 10:15)
screwed up mixed up Greg Kesava and in (10:11 - 10:18)
him so screwed up right away but yeah (10:15 - 10:20)
just a quick picture with him and that (10:18 - 10:22)
was that until later on once I started (10:20 - 10:24)
working a GameInformer and I got on (10:22 - 10:25)
Twitter so this would have been like (10:24 - 10:28)
late oh nine and I was tweeting about (10:25 - 10:30)
how much I loved Waluigi back then and (10:28 - 10:34)
he he saw that him and Ryan Davis saw me (10:30 - 10:35)
talking about (10:34 - 10:37)
Waluigi and they followed me like (10:35 - 10:39)
basically like to grief me to make fun (10:37 - 10:40)
of me for liking this terrible character (10:39 - 10:43)
and so that's how this all started I (10:40 - 10:45)
came to know Jeff and Ryan and John bond (10:43 - 10:47)
crew thanks to tweeting about Waluigi (10:45 - 10:49)
and then going forward as I went to all (10:47 - 10:52)
these industry events and III s and all (10:49 - 10:53)
this stuff I I would always run into (10:52 - 10:55)
Jeff and you know since we talked all (10:53 - 10:57)
the time on Twitter we would hang out at (10:55 - 11:00)
these shows and Jeff and Ryan started in (10:57 - 11:02)
inviting me on to the bomb cast during (11:00 - 11:04)
e3 so got a little bit of experience (11:02 - 11:05)
actually working with the guys on (11:04 - 11:07)
podcasts and (11:05 - 11:09)
and when the time came when I was ready (11:07 - 11:11)
to get out of Minnesota and move on (11:09 - 11:14)
career-wise that had all worked out (11:11 - 11:16)
cool yeah that's a great story actually (11:14 - 11:18)
I didn't know the whole beginning part (11:16 - 11:20)
of you know just being a fan oh yeah (11:18 - 11:23)
yeah mm eh it was such a long time ago (11:20 - 11:25)
now yeah yeah I've been doing III since (11:23 - 11:28)
oh six so I guess this year was my tenth (11:25 - 11:29)
one actually well no I guess it'll be my (11:28 - 11:31)
ninth one cuz I missed the one in (11:29 - 11:33)
between Game Informer and guy bomb I was (11:31 - 11:34)
getting ready for the move oh right (11:33 - 11:38)
right yep yeah you have a ton of fans (11:34 - 11:42)
and you're also a huge fan of uh well I (11:38 - 11:44)
think it's okay for me to say this (11:42 - 11:45)
you're a huge fan of wrestling and (11:44 - 11:48)
wrestlers oh yes and in if you look at (11:45 - 11:50)
the other side of the coin you have a (11:48 - 11:52)
lot of fans because of Giant Bomb how do (11:50 - 11:54)
you handle both situations of your fans (11:52 - 11:56)
and then also being a fan I mean I've (11:54 - 11:59)
never stopped considering myself a fan (11:56 - 12:01)
in general even if just like the gaming (11:59 - 12:03)
industry like I I kind of just feel (12:01 - 12:05)
lucky to be here every morning so yeah I (12:03 - 12:08)
don't know I it is weird to stop and (12:05 - 12:10)
think that like yes I have fans and you (12:08 - 12:11)
know much followers on Twitter and all (12:10 - 12:13)
that stuff because I still just feel (12:11 - 12:16)
like a lucky kid who gets to play video (12:13 - 12:18)
games at work you know I don't 33 years (12:16 - 12:20)
old now but I mean I honestly feel like (12:18 - 12:21)
like a kid that won some toys-r-us (12:20 - 12:23)
contests and now I'm getting paid to (12:21 - 12:25)
play video games or something so yeah (12:23 - 12:27)
it's it's I consider myself a fan first (12:25 - 12:29)
and foremost a fan of video games a fan (12:27 - 12:31)
of wrestling I mean those are the two (12:29 - 12:33)
things that I've been absolutely in love (12:31 - 12:35)
with since the first time I encountered (12:33 - 12:38)
both of them so I'm a fan first I'd say (12:35 - 12:41)
okay I want to move into the book you (12:38 - 12:44)
wrote which I've read I loved I actually (12:41 - 12:47)
when we when we started talking on (12:44 - 12:49)
Twitter I told you that you know I don't (12:47 - 12:51)
experience anxiety but my girlfriend (12:49 - 12:53)
really does and you wrote a book called (12:51 - 12:58)
anxiety as an ally and about two or (12:53 - 13:00)
three years ago and so being a big fan (12:58 - 13:03)
of you and Giant Bomb I would I would be (13:00 - 13:05)
in situations where I would come home (13:03 - 13:08)
and my girlfriend would be nowhere to be (13:05 - 13:10)
found her car would be in the garage her (13:08 - 13:13)
phone would be on the table and she just (13:10 - 13:14)
I couldn't find her and I would end up (13:13 - 13:17)
fine walking into like our walk-in (13:14 - 13:19)
closet and her just on the floor crying (13:17 - 13:24)
and not being able to explain what went (13:19 - 13:27)
wrong and to me I always felt like what (13:24 - 13:28)
did I do I like I just got home I don't (13:27 - 13:31)
why are you upset and so it was very (13:28 - 13:34)
hard for me you know and I've been with (13:31 - 13:38)
her for over five years now and I didn't (13:34 - 13:39)
know how to deal with that and I (13:38 - 13:41)
actually read your book I got it because (13:39 - 13:44)
of your stories on giantbomb and it (13:41 - 13:46)
everything almost made sense to me so I (13:44 - 13:48)
kind of wanted to talk about the book (13:46 - 13:50)
and why you wrote it well it's (13:48 - 13:51)
interesting that what you described is (13:50 - 13:54)
it's kind of exactly why I wrote it is I (13:51 - 13:56)
wanted people kind of two reasons I (13:54 - 13:57)
wanted people with anxiety to kind of (13:56 - 14:00)
see the ways that I've kind of helped (13:57 - 14:02)
make it a lot easier for myself and I (14:00 - 14:04)
don't have nearly as much anxiety as I (14:02 - 14:07)
used to but also what you described is (14:04 - 14:10)
is for people that have loved ones you (14:07 - 14:11)
know people in their family or (14:10 - 14:13)
significant others or friends that have (14:11 - 14:15)
anxiety disorders and I'm not talking (14:13 - 14:19)
about like standard you know stressors (14:15 - 14:20)
and things like that like everyone gets (14:19 - 14:22)
stressed everyone feels anxiety you know (14:20 - 14:24)
like overwork or tests or school or (14:22 - 14:26)
whatever it is I'm talking about like (14:24 - 14:27)
you know disorders like what you're (14:26 - 14:29)
describing with your girlfriend and what (14:27 - 14:31)
I have because it's a it's an impossible (14:29 - 14:34)
thing to describe because a lot of times (14:31 - 14:35)
people will just be like Oh what do you (14:34 - 14:36)
have to worry about what's going on why (14:35 - 14:38)
don't we why would you be nervous right (14:36 - 14:40)
now what's making you anxious and that's (14:38 - 14:41)
the frustrating thing is like there's (14:40 - 14:44)
never or a lot of times there is no (14:41 - 14:47)
actual thing that's causing it it's just (14:44 - 14:49)
it just happens because you have a (14:47 - 14:51)
disorder it's an illness and it was (14:49 - 14:53)
extremely frustrating for me growing up (14:51 - 14:55)
trying to explain this to certain people (14:53 - 14:57)
in my family namely my father my father (14:55 - 14:59)
back then you know I talked about this (14:57 - 15:00)
in the book but he would just be like (14:59 - 15:01)
chill out just chill out what he have to (15:00 - 15:02)
worry about come on way to quit being (15:01 - 15:04)
weird just you know chill out and I (15:02 - 15:06)
would try to explain like no dad you (15:04 - 15:08)
don't understand like I am feel like man (15:06 - 15:09)
you know my heart rate is going crazy my (15:08 - 15:11)
breathing is nuts I feel like something (15:09 - 15:13)
terrible's about to happen and logically (15:11 - 15:16)
you know I knew that that there was (15:13 - 15:17)
nothing there's no danger there's no (15:16 - 15:19)
imminent danger it's just this (15:17 - 15:21)
fight-or-flight reflex that was kicking (15:19 - 15:24)
in at inappropriate times so I wanted to (15:21 - 15:26)
write a book for for people like you (15:24 - 15:28)
that have significant other so you can (15:26 - 15:30)
read it and have kind of a better idea (15:28 - 15:32)
of what they're going through in fact my (15:30 - 15:33)
dad (15:32 - 15:34)
read the book after came out and he (15:33 - 15:36)
called me to apologize he's like wow (15:34 - 15:38)
okay now that I've read this book I I (15:36 - 15:39)
see where you're going through and I and (15:38 - 15:42)
I I see that it was a very real thing so (15:39 - 15:44)
so it's that I wanted people like you to (15:42 - 15:46)
be able to read it and understand people (15:44 - 15:48)
in your life that have anxiety disorders (15:46 - 15:50)
yeah I think I started listening to (15:48 - 15:53)
Giant Bomb two to three weeks before you (15:50 - 15:55)
actually came on I remember the whole (15:53 - 15:59)
Vinny moving to New York and them (15:55 - 16:01)
setting up Giant Bomb East and then when (15:59 - 16:03)
you came on Giant Bomb I was just like (16:01 - 16:05)
who is this guy (16:03 - 16:06)
because I remember like your hot dog (16:05 - 16:09)
story in college and all the crazy food (16:06 - 16:13)
you eat and I was like this get Ike is (16:09 - 16:17)
are you a real person yeah yeah I'm (16:13 - 16:20)
pretty sure you know that's that's a (16:17 - 16:22)
thing I get a lot just because you know (16:20 - 16:24)
I do tell a lot of crazy stories and I (16:22 - 16:28)
yes ah I maybe I play things up at times (16:24 - 16:31)
you know I play I play dumb a decent (16:28 - 16:33)
amount for I guess entertainment (16:31 - 16:36)
purposes but the important thing to me (16:33 - 16:39)
is that I never lie you know I all the (16:36 - 16:41)
stories I tell you know the hot dog (16:39 - 16:42)
stories are the egg-white stories (16:41 - 16:43)
whatever those are all I do percent (16:42 - 16:43)
truth (16:43 - 16:46)
but yeah it's kind of hard to describe (16:43 - 16:49)
it's not something I consciously do it's (16:46 - 16:50)
not like when I see the red light on a (16:49 - 16:52)
camera or when the podcast starts and (16:50 - 16:53)
I'm like okay time to turn into dumb Dan (16:52 - 16:56)
it's it's not like that it's just I (16:53 - 16:58)
don't know it's just kind of you play (16:56 - 17:00)
things up you go back to wrestling like (16:58 - 17:01)
an analogy is you always hear about the (17:00 - 17:04)
the best pro wrestling characters are (17:01 - 17:06)
just real-life like who the wrestler is (17:04 - 17:09)
as a real person turned up to 11 like to (17:06 - 17:11)
a cartoonish degree like Stone Cold (17:09 - 17:12)
Steve Austin it really is a (17:11 - 17:14)
beer-swilling redneck you know the rock (17:12 - 17:16)
really is this kind of you know cocky (17:14 - 17:19)
charismatic dude so it yeah it is just (17:16 - 17:22)
my real personality in real stories but (17:19 - 17:24)
yeah things are played up to a certain (17:22 - 17:26)
extent I would say but but yes I think (17:24 - 17:27)
I'm a real person (17:26 - 17:30)
well after you know the your your egg (17:27 - 17:31)
whites or your hot dog story (17:30 - 17:34)
I don't know when when you I can't (17:31 - 17:36)
remember the exact time when you started (17:34 - 17:38)
talking about your book or your anxiety (17:36 - 17:41)
on giantbomb but it really to me it was (17:38 - 17:43)
like a right time right time and place (17:41 - 17:46)
situation and when I talked earlier (17:43 - 17:47)
about like (17:46 - 17:49)
always asking my girlfriend like what do (17:47 - 17:50)
you have to worry about we have two good (17:49 - 17:53)
jobs you know we have we have a savings (17:50 - 17:55)
we have three cats like life is good (17:53 - 17:57)
nothing's going we don't have medical (17:55 - 18:00)
bills like I don't get why you're (17:57 - 18:01)
worrying or why you're so anxious and (18:00 - 18:04)
for me it was like you have this (18:01 - 18:07)
cartoonish character on giantbomb which (18:04 - 18:10)
is a compliment like I think the whole I (18:07 - 18:11)
think you're amazing I think John Baum (18:10 - 18:13)
is amazing but then for you to go like (18:11 - 18:14)
almost a hundred and eighty degrees of (18:13 - 18:16)
having these egg-white stories to now (18:14 - 18:18)
having a book on anxiety I was so (18:16 - 18:21)
compelled to buy it and read it and my (18:18 - 18:23)
girlfriend read it and she loved it and (18:21 - 18:27)
that opened up a window I think in my (18:23 - 18:29)
life to go like now I understand things (18:27 - 18:32)
better but that leads me to my second (18:29 - 18:35)
question is you spent a bit of time just (18:32 - 18:37)
a couple weeks ago on giantbomb talking (18:35 - 18:40)
about a book called 10% happier yeah and (18:37 - 18:43)
you were just recently on the 10% (18:40 - 18:45)
happier podcast which was fantastic (18:43 - 18:48)
thank you I think that's like you've now (18:45 - 18:50)
opened up a second window in my life to (18:48 - 18:52)
meditation and I kind of wanted to talk (18:50 - 18:54)
about that so 10% happier isn't a book (18:52 - 18:56)
that like teaches you about meditation (18:54 - 18:59)
it's just a book that informs you is (18:56 - 19:00)
that would you agree like just lets you (18:59 - 19:03)
know that it exists I think it just (19:00 - 19:05)
serves as kind of a gateway for people (19:03 - 19:08)
that you don't know anything about (19:05 - 19:11)
meditation like I considered myself kind (19:08 - 19:12)
of one I mean you know I've been doing (19:11 - 19:14)
it for a long time but I started out (19:12 - 19:17)
very skeptical about it because it just (19:14 - 19:18)
seemed to me like back when I didn't (19:17 - 19:19)
know anything about it that it was just (19:18 - 19:21)
this new agey thing with a bunch of (19:19 - 19:23)
people sitting around chanting or (19:21 - 19:25)
whatever like I didn't know if it was a (19:23 - 19:29)
religious thing or was but once I (19:25 - 19:31)
started doing it I realized that it's (19:29 - 19:33)
just it's exercise for your mind the (19:31 - 19:34)
same way that that physical exercise (19:33 - 19:35)
works for your body it doesn't have to (19:34 - 19:38)
come with any of the spiritual things if (19:35 - 19:39)
you don't want it to and that's what the (19:38 - 19:42)
book is targeting as Dan Harris is a guy (19:39 - 19:44)
he's a anchor for Good Morning America (19:42 - 19:46)
and for Nightline and he had a panic (19:44 - 19:48)
attack on the air while he was hosting (19:46 - 19:50)
Good Morning America and so that led him (19:48 - 19:53)
and he's very naturally skeptical about (19:50 - 19:57)
you know those new agey type things it (19:53 - 19:58)
led him into looking about meditation (19:57 - 20:00)
and learning about it (19:58 - 20:03)
and so basically it's just taking the (20:00 - 20:05)
skeptics perspective the meditation and (20:03 - 20:07)
just okay okay I'm just a regular guy (20:05 - 20:09)
I'm not like somebody who's you know (20:07 - 20:10)
chanting you're collecting healing (20:09 - 20:13)
crystals or you know talking about (20:10 - 20:14)
chakras or you know all these things (20:13 - 20:16)
that make meditation seem impenetrable (20:14 - 20:18)
if that's all you hear about it his book (20:16 - 20:19)
was just a way of kind of boiling it (20:18 - 20:21)
down to like hey here's what it is (20:19 - 20:23)
when it comes down to it it's following (20:21 - 20:25)
your breath it just it helps anxiety (20:23 - 20:27)
there's just been a million scientific (20:25 - 20:29)
studies on this stuff that you know this (20:27 - 20:31)
is a real thing you can take it to the (20:29 - 20:33)
super religious degree if you want to or (20:31 - 20:35)
you can just you know meditate every day (20:33 - 20:36)
the way you would get on the elliptical (20:35 - 20:39)
every day so that's what really led me (20:36 - 20:40)
to that book and then got me way more in (20:39 - 20:43)
a meditation than I already was is it's (20:40 - 20:44)
a great resource it's a great entry way (20:43 - 20:46)
for people that that kind of don't know (20:44 - 20:49)
what meditation is so yeah after I read (20:46 - 20:52)
anxiety as an ally I don't think a lot (20:49 - 20:54)
of listeners know this about me but I (20:52 - 20:56)
think everyone has struggles in their (20:54 - 20:59)
life especially you know as you grow (20:56 - 21:01)
older and things change but at one point (20:59 - 21:04)
that that book kind of opened a window (21:01 - 21:07)
and I my girlfriend suggested that I (21:04 - 21:10)
should go to therapy and I don't know if (21:07 - 21:12)
you've ever been to therapy or or what (21:10 - 21:15)
not but I remember when you told the (21:12 - 21:17)
meditation story and you were you were (21:15 - 21:18)
like I originally thought it was like (21:17 - 21:20)
for hippies or like this new age kind of (21:18 - 21:22)
thing and I I thought the same thing of (21:20 - 21:23)
therapy I was like I'm not and I told my (21:22 - 21:25)
girlfriend I'm like I'm not crazy I (21:23 - 21:27)
don't need help I'm perfectly sound like (21:25 - 21:29)
I wake up every day I go to work I work (21:27 - 21:31)
I come home I do this I do that like why (21:29 - 21:33)
would I need therapy and I ended up (21:31 - 21:36)
going going for about six weeks six or (21:33 - 21:38)
eight weeks a couple sessions once a (21:36 - 21:40)
week and kind of just walk through (21:38 - 21:42)
things and things were things just got (21:40 - 21:45)
so much better instantly and it was (21:42 - 21:47)
funny because I told my mom that and (21:45 - 21:49)
she's the same thing I originally (21:47 - 21:51)
thought she's like what are you crazy do (21:49 - 21:52)
you need help it's like do we need to (21:51 - 21:54)
check you into a mental institute and I (21:52 - 21:57)
was like no mom like yeah it was like if (21:54 - 21:58)
you're sick you go to the doctor if you (21:57 - 22:00)
need and I and I save like if you need (21:58 - 22:03)
advice like you can go to a therapist (22:00 - 22:05)
like it's kind of the same thing but it (22:03 - 22:08)
did help a lot and then on the bomb cast (22:05 - 22:10)
you started talking about 10% happier I (22:08 - 22:12)
ended up going through that whole book (22:10 - 22:13)
and (22:12 - 22:15)
and I recently started meditating I do (22:13 - 22:17)
10 minutes a day and I've done that for (22:15 - 22:19)
the about the past two weeks and it's (22:17 - 22:21)
it's like day and night different my (22:19 - 22:25)
days yeah and that's I that's mostly to (22:21 - 22:27)
you and how you've kind of broken things (22:25 - 22:29)
down and I don't know if if other (22:27 - 22:31)
listeners have told you that but you (22:29 - 22:33)
know you go from like anxiety to an ally (22:31 - 22:35)
to you promoting 10 percent happier to (22:33 - 22:38)
you saying that meditation is great and (22:35 - 22:40)
that's you were right in every one of (22:38 - 22:42)
those aspects I appreciate that and (22:40 - 22:45)
that's part of what I want to do is you (22:42 - 22:46)
know you talk about you know the way (22:45 - 22:48)
some people react when you say you're (22:46 - 22:50)
going to therapy is you know you're (22:48 - 22:51)
crazier like I did it's just silly to me (22:50 - 22:55)
that there's still a stigma among some (22:51 - 22:57)
people about like you know people that (22:55 - 22:58)
meditate oh you're a hippie or Oh people (22:57 - 23:00)
that go to therapy oh you must be crazy (22:58 - 23:02)
like no there shouldn't be a stigma (23:00 - 23:04)
attached to that whether you know the (23:02 - 23:05)
most serious mental illness or just (23:04 - 23:07)
everyday stress and in normal anxiety (23:05 - 23:10)
you know it's there's no problem with (23:07 - 23:11)
that like there should be no shame and (23:10 - 23:14)
admitting that you know you could you (23:11 - 23:16)
could talk so you could use someone to (23:14 - 23:18)
talk to or you could use you know (23:16 - 23:19)
looking into something like meditation (23:18 - 23:21)
to kind of improve things you know it's (23:19 - 23:23)
I think it's just absolutely silly to be (23:21 - 23:25)
to be ashamed of something like that (23:23 - 23:26)
it's like being ashamed of getting a (23:25 - 23:29)
cold I just don't understand why people (23:26 - 23:30)
would think that way and so I I want to (23:29 - 23:32)
open up the conversation as much as (23:30 - 23:33)
possible you know I've got a lot of (23:32 - 23:35)
followers and I have these platforms (23:33 - 23:37)
where a lot of people can hear me and I (23:35 - 23:39)
kind of want to do what I can to help (23:37 - 23:41)
bring that stigma down and and show that (23:39 - 23:42)
it's not just for crazy people and (23:41 - 23:45)
hippies or whatever you said after your (23:42 - 23:47)
dad read your book he kind of apologized (23:45 - 23:50)
when it came to the anxiety thing what (23:47 - 23:52)
was his reaction to you telling him like (23:50 - 23:54)
you you meditate was it still the like (23:52 - 23:57)
oh oh you're doing this hippy thing or (23:54 - 23:59)
was he more understanding of that I mean (23:57 - 24:01)
by the time I was talking a lot about (23:59 - 24:03)
meditation that was kind of round the (24:01 - 24:06)
time like it was just a couple years ago (24:03 - 24:08)
that I really started talking about (24:06 - 24:10)
meditation a lot and by that time my dad (24:08 - 24:14)
had already kind of understood that he (24:10 - 24:16)
was wrong to kind of blow it off earlier (24:14 - 24:18)
in my life so it's not like we talked (24:16 - 24:19)
about meditation or anything like that (24:18 - 24:20)
or it's it's certainly not something (24:19 - 24:23)
that that he would ever try himself but (24:20 - 24:26)
he's never given me any grief for it you (24:23 - 24:26)
know if (24:26 - 24:29)
if I talked about it 10 years ago I bet (24:26 - 24:31)
he would have but by the time I was like (24:29 - 24:33)
really talking about it a lot he he was (24:31 - 24:35)
a used kind of grown out of that I think (24:33 - 24:38)
for for people listening to this and (24:35 - 24:41)
curious because on the show we don't (24:38 - 24:43)
really get to you know specific and (24:41 - 24:45)
topic besides Pokemon but like as (24:43 - 24:47)
serious as a topic as this isn't (24:45 - 24:48)
something I wanted to talk to you about (24:47 - 24:50)
because it's was such an influence on my (24:48 - 24:52)
life how did you start meditating (24:50 - 24:54)
because I think that it's something that (24:52 - 24:58)
anyone or everyone could do even if they (24:54 - 25:02)
don't have anxiety or that they're not (24:58 - 25:04)
going to therapy I still think it's a (25:02 - 25:06)
valuable tool that somebody could do (25:04 - 25:08)
every day how did you start (25:06 - 25:12)
I started in 2002 it was right before I (25:08 - 25:15)
went to college and I had a psychology (25:12 - 25:17)
class I did this thing where the summer (25:15 - 25:18)
before you start your freshman year you (25:17 - 25:20)
take a couple classes on campus to kind (25:18 - 25:21)
of get used to how college works blah (25:20 - 25:23)
blah blah but one of them was a (25:21 - 25:25)
psychology class and I had this teacher (25:23 - 25:28)
named buddy and he had us meditate in (25:25 - 25:32)
class and prior to that I had never ever (25:28 - 25:34)
thought about meditation whatsoever I (25:32 - 25:35)
mean I would have just blown it off it's (25:34 - 25:37)
like the hippie thing or whatever and (25:35 - 25:39)
this is also prior to me you know really (25:37 - 25:41)
developing my anxiety disorders and in (25:39 - 25:45)
full force so he told us as a class he's (25:41 - 25:47)
like all right I'm gonna show you guys (25:45 - 25:50)
something and if you do this for an hour (25:47 - 25:53)
day I promise you it will change your (25:50 - 25:54)
life and he got like way more like (25:53 - 25:56)
serious and like adamant about this and (25:54 - 25:57)
I had ever seen him in class he was like (25:56 - 25:59)
I'm telling you right now I'm not gonna (25:57 - 26:02)
I can't force you to do this but if you (25:59 - 26:03)
do this for now or your life will change (26:02 - 26:03)
for the better (26:03 - 26:05)
I never go okay when this is gonna get (26:03 - 26:08)
weird what is this about and he had us (26:05 - 26:09)
do 10 minutes of meditation he had us (26:08 - 26:12)
all close our eyes and just do the most (26:09 - 26:14)
basic meditation 101 you can imagine you (26:12 - 26:16)
know focus on the breath you know when (26:14 - 26:17)
thoughts come in you know acknowledge (26:16 - 26:18)
that you had a thought and then just (26:17 - 26:19)
kind of let it go and don't beat (26:18 - 26:21)
yourself up for for getting off track of (26:19 - 26:22)
the breath you know it was just the most (26:21 - 26:25)
starter meditation thing ever but yeah (26:22 - 26:27)
and after 10 minutes just the the (26:25 - 26:30)
feeling that I had was and you have to (26:27 - 26:31)
remember that at this point in my life I (26:30 - 26:34)
had not had anxiety disorders before but (26:31 - 26:36)
even then I just noticed that just from (26:34 - 26:38)
my baseline normal how I went about my (26:36 - 26:40)
day to 10 minutes (26:38 - 26:43)
later the difference was so so (26:40 - 26:45)
noticeable that I kind of realized that (26:43 - 26:48)
okay wow this is not just some weird (26:45 - 26:50)
hippy thing this is this is a real thing (26:48 - 26:51)
like I feel noticeably different right (26:50 - 26:53)
now and I even went into that thing (26:51 - 26:55)
really skeptical and just went along (26:53 - 26:57)
with it because I was is what my teacher (26:55 - 26:58)
is telling me I need to do right now I (26:57 - 27:01)
guess I'll do it and it totally worked I (26:58 - 27:03)
felt completely different after that ten (27:01 - 27:05)
minutes and that's what got me (27:03 - 27:06)
interested in continuing that going (27:05 - 27:09)
forward I remember my first time (27:06 - 27:11)
attempting to meditate it wasn't with an (27:09 - 27:13)
app it wasn't with you know any help it (27:11 - 27:15)
was just assuming what I knew about (27:13 - 27:17)
meditation and after listening to ten (27:15 - 27:20)
percent happier and I tried it for 10 or (27:17 - 27:22)
15 minutes and it didn't I was (27:20 - 27:24)
frustrated that like I didn't feel any (27:22 - 27:26)
better our I didn't think it worked and (27:24 - 27:30)
I was again slightly dismissive of it so (27:26 - 27:32)
I guess my question is eventually I (27:30 - 27:34)
found a groove I did use an app I use an (27:32 - 27:37)
app called a headspace I don't know I (27:34 - 27:40)
use that yeah yeah I scoured the (27:37 - 27:42)
Internet of what people suggested and (27:40 - 27:43)
the only complaint I found about (27:42 - 27:45)
headspace was it was expensive but that (27:43 - 27:49)
app helped me a lot some sessions feel (27:45 - 27:50)
really good and some don't and the app (27:49 - 27:53)
does tell you like hey sometimes it's (27:50 - 27:56)
harder on certain days and that's okay (27:53 - 27:59)
what would you say to somebody who you (27:56 - 28:01)
know gave it a try once or twice but (27:59 - 28:04)
didn't feel anything I remember you (28:01 - 28:06)
talking to Dan Harris and he said like (28:04 - 28:07)
the first time you pick up an instrument (28:06 - 28:10)
you're just not automatically good at it (28:07 - 28:11)
and you shouldn't let that discourage (28:10 - 28:14)
you yeah and just like physical exercise (28:11 - 28:15)
you know if you walk into a gym for the (28:14 - 28:16)
first time you're not gonna add (28:15 - 28:18)
benchpress 500 pounds you know that's (28:16 - 28:20)
not how it works like you know maybe I (28:18 - 28:22)
was lucky that that it works so well for (28:20 - 28:24)
the first time and I don't want to (28:22 - 28:26)
oversell my first time like I felt (28:24 - 28:29)
noticeably different enough to realize (28:26 - 28:30)
that it was a real thing and that really (28:29 - 28:32)
put me down the path of really wanted to (28:30 - 28:35)
dig deep on this stuff but yeah it is (28:32 - 28:37)
definitely improved over time like I'm (28:35 - 28:39)
doing an hour two hours not two hours at (28:37 - 28:41)
a time but two hours broken up (28:39 - 28:43)
throughout the day now and it's (28:41 - 28:44)
significantly better than that first ten (28:43 - 28:47)
minutes but yeah you know it's like you (28:44 - 28:50)
said it's not gonna work the first time (28:47 - 28:52)
like to this full extent it's not going (28:50 - 28:54)
to be the same as if you've been (28:52 - 28:55)
for ten years and you're doing it for an (28:54 - 28:58)
hour at a time hopefully if you really (28:55 - 29:00)
go for it you will at least feel (28:58 - 29:02)
something just enough to kind of show (29:00 - 29:03)
you that like hey this is a real thing (29:02 - 29:06)
but yeah don't don't expect your life to (29:03 - 29:07)
change you're not gonna get superpowers (29:06 - 29:10)
or anything you know that's I think (29:07 - 29:11)
that's the mistake a lot of people make (29:10 - 29:13)
is like oh I'm gonna start doing this (29:11 - 29:14)
all the time and it's gonna be like (29:13 - 29:16)
those superpower like you know that it's (29:14 - 29:17)
this whole different mental state and (29:16 - 29:20)
sick no it's not it just it gives you (29:17 - 29:22)
better perspective on things and it kind (29:20 - 29:25)
of puts a break in between like stimuli (29:22 - 29:26)
and reaction it gives you a second to (29:25 - 29:28)
kind of step back and be like okay wait (29:26 - 29:30)
how do I want to react this is this (29:28 - 29:32)
really worth getting mad about but don't (29:30 - 29:33)
expect all that stuff to come after ten (29:32 - 29:36)
minutes and most importantly don't get (29:33 - 29:38)
discouraged if you think you're bad at (29:36 - 29:40)
it because everyone is bad at it at (29:38 - 29:42)
first you know if you close your eyes (29:40 - 29:44)
and just try to follow the breath you're (29:42 - 29:46)
not gonna be able to do that for 10 (29:44 - 29:47)
minutes your first time you know there (29:46 - 29:49)
are plenty of times I can't do that when (29:47 - 29:51)
I'm sitting down for an hour so the (29:49 - 29:53)
whole practice of meditation is (29:51 - 29:55)
recognizing when your brain is going (29:53 - 29:57)
astray like you know if you're trying to (29:55 - 29:59)
focus on your your breath and then you (29:57 - 30:00)
notice other thoughts coming in (29:59 - 30:02)
meditation is all about noticing that (30:00 - 30:04)
those thoughts came in acknowledging (30:02 - 30:06)
that and not beating yourself up you (30:04 - 30:08)
just let it kind of float on by like I (30:06 - 30:09)
think one of those headspace animations (30:08 - 30:12)
said like you know picture your brain (30:09 - 30:14)
and it's like this the sky and every (30:12 - 30:15)
once in a while a clouds gonna come by (30:14 - 30:17)
and you don't get mad at the cloud you (30:15 - 30:19)
just kind of let it float by and some (30:17 - 30:21)
days are gonna be clearer than others so (30:19 - 30:23)
if you if you sit there the whole time (30:21 - 30:25)
and beat yourself up every time another (30:23 - 30:26)
thought comes into your head you're not (30:25 - 30:28)
gonna get anywhere with it so it's just (30:26 - 30:30)
a matter of kind of realizing that and a (30:28 - 30:32)
lot of that comes through practice how (30:30 - 30:34)
do you fit I know a lot of people are (30:32 - 30:37)
think they're their day is already too (30:34 - 30:39)
busy and when I first started meditating (30:37 - 30:41)
I was like I don't know how I would even (30:39 - 30:44)
fit this into my day and now I find it (30:41 - 30:47)
extremely easy to just take 10 minutes (30:44 - 30:48)
after lunch or that's what I've been (30:47 - 30:51)
doing it is after lunch to meditate and (30:48 - 30:53)
that helps me with the rest of my (30:51 - 30:55)
afternoon at work but you've been you (30:53 - 30:57)
meditate 1 to 2 hours a day so I'm sure (30:55 - 31:00)
people are dumbfounded of like how does (30:57 - 31:02)
he have that much time in the day I mean (31:00 - 31:04)
you you make time for the things that (31:02 - 31:06)
are important to you you know before I (31:04 - 31:07)
was doing an hour (31:06 - 31:09)
day of meditation you know back when I (31:07 - 31:11)
was doing you know ten minutes a day or (31:09 - 31:12)
just kind of slacking off and not doing (31:11 - 31:15)
a lot I mean I was easily spending more (31:12 - 31:16)
than an hour just messing around on (31:15 - 31:18)
Twitter or just you know clicking (31:16 - 31:20)
through the same you know links on my (31:18 - 31:22)
computer that I check every single day (31:20 - 31:24)
just going through those same cycles (31:22 - 31:26)
like then I found out that oh you know (31:24 - 31:27)
meditations make me feel way better than (31:26 - 31:30)
just kind of mindlessly browsing the (31:27 - 31:32)
Internet so I found time for it (31:30 - 31:34)
you know I wake up an hour earlier I go (31:32 - 31:36)
to work early I you know we're basically (31:34 - 31:37)
supposed to be on the clock at 10 (31:36 - 31:38)
o'clock (31:37 - 31:40)
so I get there by 9 o'clock every day (31:38 - 31:43)
and I said now and I do it at work for (31:40 - 31:46)
an hour so you just make time for it and (31:43 - 31:49)
I know it's easy for me to say has you (31:46 - 31:51)
know a guy with no kids and you know my (31:49 - 31:53)
only real responsibility is getting to (31:51 - 31:55)
work and doing my thing there but you (31:53 - 31:56)
know even if you have kids even if you (31:55 - 31:58)
have a lot of busy stuff going on in (31:56 - 32:00)
your life you can believe 10 minutes (31:58 - 32:02)
early can leave 15 minutes early try to (32:00 - 32:05)
find time for it it doesn't look I know (32:02 - 32:07)
I'm doing an hour to a day that's really (32:05 - 32:11)
kind of intensive meditation practice 10 (32:07 - 32:13)
minutes a day will help you tremendously (32:11 - 32:15)
just shave off 10 minutes of something (32:13 - 32:17)
else you're doing that maybe isn't (32:15 - 32:19)
making it feel great and put it towards (32:17 - 32:22)
this and before we wrap up the (32:19 - 32:24)
meditation part is there is there like (32:22 - 32:26)
an app or some or a book or something (32:24 - 32:28)
you would recommend to somebody you (32:26 - 32:29)
haven't wrote you haven't written a (32:28 - 32:31)
meditation book yet well I mean (32:29 - 32:33)
anxieties and a lie is is pretty heavily (32:31 - 32:36)
especially near the end about meditation (32:33 - 32:39)
it kind of talks about it covers several (32:36 - 32:40)
different things that are kind of helped (32:39 - 32:41)
me with my anxiety but I think the big (32:40 - 32:44)
takeaway of my book is is kind of how (32:41 - 32:46)
much meditation changed things for me so (32:44 - 32:49)
but yeah it's certainly not a how-to on (32:46 - 32:51)
meditation I'd say if you want to learn (32:49 - 32:54)
what kind of more of a how to check out (32:51 - 32:56)
wherever you go there you are by Jon (32:54 - 32:57)
kabat-zinn (32:56 - 32:59)
he is a he's a guy that kind of brought (32:57 - 33:01)
mindfulness meditation to the West back (32:59 - 33:03)
in I believe the 70s you know it's it's (33:01 - 33:05)
a little more kind of Flowery a little (33:03 - 33:07)
more hippyish way of speaking than like (33:05 - 33:10)
me or dan harris but all the advice is (33:07 - 33:11)
really good and it really does a good (33:10 - 33:13)
job of explaining the benefits of (33:11 - 33:16)
meditation as well as how how to do it (33:13 - 33:18)
awesome well let's let's move away from (33:16 - 33:21)
that heavy topic I I appreciate you (33:18 - 33:21)
taking (33:21 - 33:23)
the time and talking about that because (33:21 - 33:24)
that's something that's been you know a (33:23 - 33:26)
little bit newer to me and it was really (33:24 - 33:28)
because of your conversation that you (33:26 - 33:30)
guys had a giant bond that really sprung (33:28 - 33:32)
that forward well I'm glad to open up (33:30 - 33:34)
that conversation whenever I get a (33:32 - 33:36)
chance so it's cool to see people taking (33:34 - 33:37)
something out of it yeah and hopefully (33:36 - 33:40)
hopefully my listeners can get and get a (33:37 - 33:42)
takeaway from that I run a we have a (33:40 - 33:44)
patreon for the show and we have a slack (33:42 - 33:46)
community or some people use discord but (33:44 - 33:47)
it's pretty much the same thing but we (33:46 - 33:48)
have a slack community for people who (33:47 - 33:50)
who donate like a dollar a month and we (33:48 - 33:52)
have a we have a mindfulness channel in (33:50 - 33:54)
there and it's cool it's a it's a lot of (33:52 - 33:57)
people that oh you you you started (33:54 - 33:59)
meditating and I'm like yeah and this is (33:57 - 34:01)
the app I use and so far so good and so (33:59 - 34:02)
it's kind of been filling up with more (34:01 - 34:04)
people and like that's really cool for (34:02 - 34:06)
me to see because I was a little not (34:04 - 34:07)
embarrassed but I didn't know how to (34:06 - 34:10)
like pitch that to people like hey (34:07 - 34:12)
instead of going to like I'm going to a (34:10 - 34:15)
gym but not for my body for my mind (34:12 - 34:16)
right and a lot of people are gonna be (34:15 - 34:18)
skeptical going in obviously so it's (34:16 - 34:20)
cool that some people have joined up in (34:18 - 34:22)
your discord in your slack there I'd say (34:20 - 34:24)
if people have specific questions that (34:22 - 34:26)
to me about that stuff like I try my (34:24 - 34:29)
best to interact on Twitter you know as (34:26 - 34:31)
much as I can with people so yeah if you (34:29 - 34:32)
have any questions about meditation or (34:31 - 34:33)
book recommendations or anything like (34:32 - 34:36)
that you or any of your listeners can (34:33 - 34:38)
get ahold of me at Dan Reicher awesome I (34:36 - 34:40)
just have a couple more questions before (34:38 - 34:43)
we wrap up here you are a big gamer (34:40 - 34:46)
obviously working for Giant Bomb Austin (34:43 - 34:48)
when we asked him he said his his (34:46 - 34:50)
favorite game was Sonic 2 but what about (34:48 - 34:53)
you link to the past (34:51 - 34:55)
that's the all-time favorite a hundred (34:53 - 34:57)
percent always has been you know I (34:55 - 35:00)
played games before that you know I got (34:57 - 35:02)
my first NES and I was four years old (35:00 - 35:04)
this would've been about like 88 and you (35:02 - 35:05)
know my first memories are playing in a (35:04 - 35:10)
Mario and Megaman punch-out but it was (35:05 - 35:12)
linked to the past that I played that I (35:10 - 35:14)
knew like as soon as I played that game (35:12 - 35:18)
okay this is I need to focus my entire (35:14 - 35:19)
life on video games like this is (35:18 - 35:21)
everything to me I mean it already kind (35:19 - 35:24)
of was with the NES but I think Link to (35:21 - 35:25)
the Past is the thing that made me like (35:24 - 35:27)
decide that I had to do this for the (35:25 - 35:29)
rest of my life like as a career (35:27 - 35:32)
I saw you recently delete clash royale (35:29 - 35:34)
from your phone yes (35:32 - 35:37)
and I think I had the same journey of (35:34 - 35:40)
you of of loving that game but also (35:37 - 35:42)
being extremely frustrated with it well (35:40 - 35:45)
it as you see more and more what that (35:42 - 35:47)
game is you realize all the little (35:45 - 35:49)
tricks and dumb things it does to try to (35:47 - 35:50)
pull you in and get money from you and (35:49 - 35:52)
everything and I understand why they do (35:50 - 35:54)
it I mean video games are a business and (35:52 - 35:56)
companies need to make business you need (35:54 - 35:58)
to make money and obviously clash Royale (35:56 - 36:01)
is doing a very good job of that but we (35:58 - 36:03)
started noticing the little gameplay (36:01 - 36:06)
ways that they they always dangle that (36:03 - 36:07)
Kara but never quite give it to you (36:06 - 36:09)
hoping that you're gonna give money it (36:07 - 36:12)
does feel a little insidious and I just (36:09 - 36:14)
wanted to get out of that daily grind of (36:12 - 36:16)
I always have to have a chest unlocking (36:14 - 36:17)
I always have to have this going on oh (36:16 - 36:18)
I'm kind of tempted to buy some gems (36:17 - 36:20)
like I just I saw that there was no end (36:18 - 36:22)
in sight for that game you know there's (36:20 - 36:25)
no you don't beat that game it's it just (36:22 - 36:26)
keeps going like that and it never (36:25 - 36:30)
really feels good so yeah I've been (36:26 - 36:31)
feeling much better ever since I did get (36:30 - 36:34)
rid of that game I I felt a sigh a sigh (36:31 - 36:38)
of relief I as a freedom actually I say (36:34 - 36:39)
I'm afraid to play player but I (36:38 - 36:43)
accidentally press the $100 button at (36:39 - 36:45)
one point okay because I meant to do (36:43 - 36:46)
$5.00 I was getting ready to go out for (36:45 - 36:49)
the night you know how like at a certain (36:46 - 36:51)
time you get new cards that rotate in (36:49 - 36:53)
yeah and there's there was one card I (36:51 - 36:54)
wanted to buy I was like okay I can give (36:53 - 36:56)
if I want this card I'll give it $5.00 (36:54 - 36:59)
and I was getting ready to go out to an (36:56 - 37:01)
anniversary dinner and I I hit the (36:59 - 37:03)
button and it asked for my touch ID and (37:01 - 37:05)
I gave it to it and then it asked for my (37:03 - 37:06)
touch ID again and I was like that's (37:05 - 37:07)
that's weird (37:06 - 37:09)
look why is it asking twice so I I hit (37:07 - 37:11)
it again but my other my hand was (37:09 - 37:14)
hovering over the hundred so it charged (37:11 - 37:17)
me and and right away I asked for my (37:14 - 37:19)
money back right yeah so I'm in the car (37:17 - 37:21)
I asked for my money back and they they (37:19 - 37:23)
gave me my money back action so they (37:21 - 37:25)
gave me my money back really quick I cuz (37:23 - 37:27)
iTunes does that right iTunes like every (37:25 - 37:29)
what once a year it's like okay you made (37:27 - 37:31)
a mistake here's your money right and (37:29 - 37:33)
they didn't take the gems away from me (37:31 - 37:36)
Oh which I thought they were going to do (37:33 - 37:38)
and I assumed they were going to do so I (37:36 - 37:41)
had all these gems for almost two months (37:38 - 37:42)
I didn't want to spend them because I (37:41 - 37:44)
figured they were gonna eventually take (37:42 - 37:46)
them away and they and they didn't and (37:44 - 37:48)
so I had (37:46 - 37:50)
the like the luck or the niceness of (37:48 - 37:53)
like slowly spending gems and even then (37:50 - 37:56)
they still dangled that carrot in front (37:53 - 38:00)
of you and even by buying like the (37:56 - 38:01)
biggest chests and stuff I still didn't (38:00 - 38:02)
get a legendary I still didn't get the (38:01 - 38:04)
only thing I was able to do was like I (38:02 - 38:05)
can upgrade every one of my cards (38:04 - 38:07)
because I have enough gold to do this (38:05 - 38:09)
yeah and you always think that that next (38:07 - 38:10)
thing that next upgrade that next level (38:09 - 38:12)
for your towers that's gonna be the (38:10 - 38:13)
moment that like Oh finally I'm gonna (38:12 - 38:15)
like I'm gonna win so much more and it's (38:13 - 38:16)
gonna be so much fun it's gonna be great (38:15 - 38:18)
and then you get there and then you (38:16 - 38:19)
realize you're getting matched with (38:18 - 38:22)
people that are also there and it's just (38:19 - 38:25)
the same back and forth 50% infuriating (38:22 - 38:27)
stuff and people laughing at you with (38:25 - 38:29)
the emotes and stuff and the moats are (38:27 - 38:32)
terrible oh I never get mad about video (38:29 - 38:34)
games like any time I'm playing like a (38:32 - 38:35)
multiplayer shooter or anything (38:34 - 38:37)
whenever I die you know people always (38:35 - 38:38)
get mad and you know these videos on (38:37 - 38:39)
YouTube people cursing and screaming (38:38 - 38:41)
when they die I never get mad I'm just (38:39 - 38:44)
like oh yeah if you shot me I lost I did (38:41 - 38:46)
worse than that guy whatever clash (38:44 - 38:48)
Royale is like the only game that I get (38:46 - 38:51)
serious had or if I lose in some like (38:48 - 38:53)
total BS fashion I just need to put my (38:51 - 38:54)
phone facing down (38:53 - 38:55)
just because I know that they're gonna (38:54 - 38:57)
just spam that the Laughing King or the (38:55 - 38:59)
crying King or something and it's oh (38:57 - 39:00)
there's something about it that's so (38:59 - 39:03)
infuriating so another reason I'm glad (39:00 - 39:05)
to be done with that game yeah it's it's (39:03 - 39:07)
it's crazy because at it's a great game (39:05 - 39:09)
and even if like there was if I could (39:07 - 39:11)
just pay you know $60 for that game and (39:09 - 39:13)
just have everything and be done with it (39:11 - 39:14)
I think it would be great and I (39:13 - 39:16)
understood I understand their business (39:14 - 39:18)
model I understand they were you know (39:16 - 39:19)
they were the number one top grossing (39:18 - 39:22)
app in the App Store but Pokemon go kind (39:19 - 39:26)
of took that away from them yeah they (39:22 - 39:28)
did it in a totally like candy crush (39:26 - 39:30)
clash Royale clash of clans they all (39:28 - 39:32)
kind of follow this carrot on the stick (39:30 - 39:35)
and I don't feel like Pokemon go does (39:32 - 39:36)
that which is surprising because it's (39:35 - 39:38)
making more money than all of them it's (39:36 - 39:41)
I think Apple reported it was the most (39:38 - 39:43)
downloaded app of all time recently what (39:41 - 39:45)
were your as a you know you're not a big (39:43 - 39:46)
Pokemon guy but what were your thoughts (39:45 - 39:48)
on that especially in the aspect of it (39:46 - 39:50)
does it does mobile gaming totally (39:48 - 39:51)
different than everything up to this (39:50 - 39:55)
point yeah I mean I it I played it for a (39:51 - 39:57)
while you know I put a few hours into it (39:55 - 39:59)
before I deleted it I think it's genius (39:57 - 40:01)
I think it's such a smart thing (39:59 - 40:03)
you're taking this this property a (40:01 - 40:05)
Pokemon that you know there's a lot of (40:03 - 40:07)
people that are a lot of adults now they (40:05 - 40:08)
grew up with that and having much (40:07 - 40:10)
nostalgia towards it so the property (40:08 - 40:12)
spans several different generations of (40:10 - 40:15)
gamers at this point and then you make (40:12 - 40:17)
it free to download and it's on devices (40:15 - 40:18)
that everyone already has in their (40:17 - 40:21)
pockets like it's reaching audiences (40:18 - 40:23)
that you know maybe don't play games (40:21 - 40:25)
that often that they they're out and (40:23 - 40:27)
buying 3ds they're not buying Vitas and (40:25 - 40:29)
things like that but they used to play (40:27 - 40:31)
pokemon back in like elementary school (40:29 - 40:32)
and then when they see it's on the phone (40:31 - 40:33)
that they already have and they already (40:32 - 40:35)
carry everywhere and it's free that's a (40:33 - 40:36)
no-brainer (40:35 - 40:38)
so you're tapping into like the (40:36 - 40:39)
nostalgic people that have been out of (40:38 - 40:40)
games for a long time you're tapping (40:39 - 40:42)
into people that are hardcore gamers and (40:40 - 40:43)
keep up with everything (40:42 - 40:46)
I mean they've managed to reach every (40:43 - 40:49)
every type of person you can imagine I (40:46 - 40:51)
mean I live in a big city I take public (40:49 - 40:53)
transportation and I always see people (40:51 - 40:56)
playing it just constantly so I think (40:53 - 40:57)
it's genius I think they did a really (40:56 - 41:00)
really good job with it you know it's (40:57 - 41:02)
not for me I'm done with my time with it (41:00 - 41:04)
but kudos to them they did something (41:02 - 41:07)
really unique and they're they're (41:04 - 41:09)
reaping the rewards of it right now so (41:07 - 41:10)
and I think we'll be around for a while (41:09 - 41:14)
that kind of leads into just you know a (41:10 - 41:16)
couple other questions about Pokemon do (41:14 - 41:18)
you see how I started with Pokemon um (41:16 - 41:21)
and do you folks that's good you said (41:18 - 41:22)
prior to us recording you you were a (41:21 - 41:25)
little bit familiar with the more (41:22 - 41:28)
familiar with the spin-off titles was (41:25 - 41:29)
there anything that kind of stood out in (41:28 - 41:31)
your mind I feel like the go-to for (41:29 - 41:33)
everyone is pokemons net snap but I I (41:31 - 41:36)
believe you did a quick look with Jeff (41:33 - 41:38)
of poke and tournaments so their Pokemon (41:36 - 41:40)
has gone like every which direction with (41:38 - 41:42)
their spin-off titles yeah and I've I've (41:40 - 41:44)
dabbled with a lot of it yeah I loved (41:42 - 41:46)
you know Pokemon I have times people (41:44 - 41:48)
play pokemon snap but when red and blue (41:46 - 41:51)
and yellow came around I was in like (41:48 - 41:53)
eighth or ninth grade so I was in that (41:51 - 41:55)
like you know I'm 13 14 15 whatever (41:53 - 41:57)
years old however old you are there and (41:55 - 42:01)
it's at that age a lot of people that I (41:57 - 42:02)
went school with kind of viewed of those (42:01 - 42:04)
like oh that's that kiddie game that's a (42:02 - 42:06)
game for kids and and I probably kind of (42:04 - 42:07)
subscribed that mindset to like yeah (42:06 - 42:09)
this looks like some cartoon thing or (42:07 - 42:10)
whatever I'm 15 I'm gonna deal if I'm (42:09 - 42:12)
cool I'm gonna play metal gear you know (42:10 - 42:16)
which mode of your school is hell but (42:12 - 42:18)
so yeah I had a dumb attitude back then (42:16 - 42:20)
about Pokemon and that I just I wouldn't (42:18 - 42:22)
play it at all but I did play snap (42:20 - 42:24)
I enjoyed that like I had the younger (42:22 - 42:26)
sisters that were they were born in 93 (42:24 - 42:29)
so they were very much the right age for (42:26 - 42:31)
Pokemon so they would have it and I (42:29 - 42:32)
would see them playing snap or the (42:31 - 42:35)
minigames on Pokemon Stadium things like (42:32 - 42:37)
that so I played a lot of that stuff (42:35 - 42:40)
it wasn't until Pokemon X actually that (42:37 - 42:43)
I played one of the core games it was (42:40 - 42:46)
that Game Informer at the time and I got (42:43 - 42:48)
out of that you know phase of my life (42:46 - 42:49)
where's his desk kitty crab so I (42:48 - 42:52)
actually was open-minded about it and (42:49 - 42:55)
you know I worked at a game outlet so I (42:52 - 42:56)
had a free copy so it was like wait (42:55 - 42:58)
actually no no we only got a couple (42:56 - 43:00)
codes for that in the office and I (42:58 - 43:02)
didn't get one and I remember actually (43:00 - 43:04)
yeah so I bought that game I was curious (43:02 - 43:06)
enough about it and uh people were (43:04 - 43:07)
talking about it yeah you know what I'll (43:06 - 43:10)
buy this and I put probably ten or (43:07 - 43:13)
twelve hours under Pokemon X and you (43:10 - 43:14)
know what I had a good time I enjoyed it (43:13 - 43:16)
I think I actually wrote an article on (43:14 - 43:18)
Game Informer about it I'm not entirely (43:16 - 43:21)
sure yeah I forget at this point you (43:18 - 43:23)
know it's been thousands of things but (43:21 - 43:24)
I'm pretty sure it's like oh hey here's (43:23 - 43:27)
impressions of Pokemon X from a from a (43:24 - 43:29)
franchise new cover or something I think (43:27 - 43:30)
it was called and it was it was very (43:29 - 43:31)
positive (43:30 - 43:33)
I didn't wind up beating the game but (43:31 - 43:35)
but I'm never liking what I played and I (43:33 - 43:37)
see the appeal of it definitely I saw (43:35 - 43:40)
the excitement of every time some new (43:37 - 43:41)
Pokemon showed up its economic God I (43:40 - 43:43)
have to get this and you know waiting (43:41 - 43:44)
for the ball the clink shut and (43:43 - 43:46)
everything it's I totally see the appeal (43:44 - 43:48)
now I wish I wouldn't have been a dumb (43:46 - 43:51)
junior I close minded kid but yeah (43:48 - 43:53)
that's how it was back then but no I I (43:51 - 43:55)
totally appreciate Pokemon but I can't (43:53 - 43:58)
paint myself as some expert er or do you (43:55 - 44:02)
see yourself looking forward to Sun and (43:58 - 44:04)
Moon is that's something that my mom (44:02 - 44:06)
doesn't report on a lot of Pokemon stuff (44:04 - 44:07)
I think you guys have even said that on (44:06 - 44:09)
the last bomb cast but you guys looked (44:07 - 44:11)
at pokken tournament yeah Pokemon Sun (44:09 - 44:13)
and Moon probably really big cuz those (44:11 - 44:14)
games are always you know top three (44:13 - 44:17)
sellers of the year for you know systems (44:14 - 44:18)
but is that something you guys are gonna (44:17 - 44:22)
look at or probably not yeah I you know (44:18 - 44:24)
just personally look you know I can't (44:22 - 44:25)
say what our coverage plans are because (44:24 - 44:26)
we haven't talked about it yet but (44:25 - 44:27)
personally I think I would (44:26 - 44:30)
get that and play it I think the big (44:27 - 44:32)
thing for me is my girlfriend's a bit (44:30 - 44:34)
younger than me and so she was more of (44:32 - 44:36)
the right age for Pokemon when I first (44:34 - 44:38)
came out so she she's played Maul she (44:36 - 44:40)
loves Pokemon look as I said earlier (44:38 - 44:42)
with the cards and everything so yeah we (44:40 - 44:45)
went through a while recently where she (44:42 - 44:46)
was playing pokemon red every night in (44:45 - 44:49)
bed so like I would just be laying next (44:46 - 44:49)
to her and just kind of watching her (44:49 - 44:51)
play a little bit and talking her about (44:49 - 44:54)
the game and her enthusiasm was kind of (44:51 - 44:56)
infectious like I guess she was doing a (44:54 - 44:57)
thing where she was trying to get a (44:56 - 44:59)
bunch of Pokemon in red so she could (44:57 - 45:01)
level it up and bring it into Sun and (44:59 - 45:03)
Moon yeah I guess there's some way you (45:01 - 45:05)
can do that and quick aside she was (45:03 - 45:07)
showing me all the crazy things like the (45:05 - 45:09)
error what does it error no missing no (45:07 - 45:11)
missing no that's right yeah yeah she's (45:09 - 45:12)
telling me all about these crazy (45:11 - 45:13)
glitches and stuff and then getting (45:12 - 45:15)
those all unlock so really cool to see (45:13 - 45:18)
how deep that rabbit hole went but yeah (45:15 - 45:19)
just just through being with her and (45:18 - 45:21)
everything and talking about it more I (45:19 - 45:23)
am looking forward to checking out Sun (45:21 - 45:25)
and Moon like I'm sure you know she'll (45:23 - 45:26)
get one I'll get the other will do (45:25 - 45:28)
whatever trading we can do like that'll (45:26 - 45:30)
be fun to play alongside her yeah I (45:28 - 45:33)
think Pokemon a lot of games do this but (45:30 - 45:36)
Pokemon benefits from what kind of like (45:33 - 45:38)
the MMO aspect like no one plays an MMO (45:36 - 45:41)
by themselves and I think Pokemon (45:38 - 45:44)
follows that same mindset of it (45:41 - 45:46)
definitely helps when you're all your (45:44 - 45:48)
friends are also playing Pokemon for (45:46 - 45:51)
sure yeah yeah and I have to wonder the (45:48 - 45:53)
go phenomenon I wonder how much that's (45:51 - 45:55)
gonna impact sales the son of Moon you'd (45:53 - 45:56)
have to imagine it would have some (45:55 - 45:58)
impact yeah I would I would imagine to I (45:56 - 46:01)
mean I went down to one of the more (45:58 - 46:03)
popular parks in Milwaukee and there's (46:01 - 46:05)
there was you know four hundred five (46:03 - 46:06)
hundred people in this park playing and (46:05 - 46:09)
it and you overhear conversations and (46:06 - 46:10)
you hear people mispronouncing Pokemon (46:09 - 46:12)
names are going oh look at that circle (46:10 - 46:15)
pink thing and it's a Jigglypuff like (46:12 - 46:18)
come on but like clearly they knew a (46:15 - 46:19)
little bit about Pokemon and Pokemon go (46:18 - 46:21)
is just kind of this phenomenon that (46:19 - 46:24)
that brought everyone in surely my like (46:21 - 46:26)
my podcast has gotten way more listeners (46:24 - 46:28)
just because I'm sure people went to (46:26 - 46:30)
iTunes and typed in Pokemon go and and (46:28 - 46:33)
now they see 200 episodes I've recorded (46:30 - 46:35)
but I'm sure you guys have just been (46:33 - 46:37)
slammed with like media requests of (46:35 - 46:39)
Pokemon go this Pokemon go that and I (46:37 - 46:40)
wonder how (46:39 - 46:42)
wonder if that momentum will last to the (46:40 - 46:44)
summer into the fall when these new new (46:42 - 46:47)
3ds games come out yeah a lot of the (46:44 - 46:50)
longitude way of a go is is gonna be (46:47 - 46:51)
based on what they do to the game to add (46:50 - 46:53)
to it because you know I'm sure you've (46:51 - 46:54)
heard all the criticisms about how just (46:53 - 46:57)
the game aspects of Pokemon go aren't (46:54 - 46:59)
that you know there's not a lot to do (46:57 - 47:00)
from a videogame perspective it's more (46:59 - 47:02)
of this kind of crazy real-world (47:00 - 47:04)
scavenger hunt thing like the actual (47:02 - 47:06)
battling and stuff doesn't have a lot (47:04 - 47:08)
going on so yeah I'm kind of wondering (47:06 - 47:09)
what they add to that like they're gonna (47:08 - 47:11)
be making a ton of money so I have to (47:09 - 47:13)
wonder how big their team's gonna get (47:11 - 47:14)
how frequently they're gonna be doing (47:13 - 47:15)
updates and if they can roll this (47:14 - 47:18)
momentum into you know boosting the (47:15 - 47:20)
sales of the games even they're already (47:18 - 47:21)
talking about that movie they want to (47:20 - 47:24)
