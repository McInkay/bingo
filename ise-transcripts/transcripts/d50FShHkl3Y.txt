and that takes us there and then I turn off studio mode and I can stop this music even though I like to listen to in tourney a city in my ear as I stream what's up everyone welcome how I don't even know what episode this is why we don't do this stuff live 100 hundred sixteen sixteenth episode of the Pokemon podcast live on twitch here and this is not like the normal routine here we're just last week we did it because I was out of town this week we're doing it just because of the Sun and Moon news broke my name is SBJ i am your host on my left is the travis w I don't know why because I see your Twitter handle below your uh your face Travis is here with this so I thought everything was gonna so it so kind of I'm gonna bring our listeners back to when gen-6 was announced and the and the starters were revealed and froakie was the obviously best one but well was like uh it's croaky it's gonna evolve and do a ghost froakie's terrible chespin is or know you like fennekin didn't you regardless you liked one of the wrong ones and and but then but then I got my hopes up that you know we would be able to put these things beside and move on with this new generation because we both saw rowlett and realized yeah that's the right one and we'll get to that later but now you change your twitter picture to poly oh yeah is that how we're saying item that's uh Oh Papa supply it up like cuz lying in yo pop apply oh oh maybe I either way it's an abomination and and like I thought we were gonna be like teammates this time but I guess we're still gonna be mortal enemies in Gen Zevon well I mean you want to be lame stream I want to be cool and hip and papaya was the cool and hip way to go so it's about rel its fault it's the objectively better one so more people like it yeah so is twenty one pilots mmm art 21 pilot expert will is also here for those listening to the only audio version I'm only an expert in putting down twenty one pilots and their overplayed overhyped lack of imagination 21 papaleo yep now 21 rabbits pop y 0 is out well if I keep saying Papa Leo that I mean that's how it's written but I guess it's a sea lion pup lie oh that's weird and of course my mom was like oh I like that one cuz it's like a puppy I thought and she thought it was a dog she literally did what those enough to realize it wasn't a dog it's well let's just jump right into things uh what is today thursday on tuesday if i'm not mistaken was it tuesday yeah i'm yeah very off on dates here I'm Tuesday Pokemon announced their starters which they seem to do every may actually going back on my facebook timeline three years ago was when we got the X&Y stuff and then before that I think I think diamond and pearl is also stuff was also announced in may but I don't remember that period as well as the x and y pillars of the dark years we're not talking about ruby and sapphire here alright so but ruby and sapphire you said diamond diamond pro confused by your timeline def continue I don't remember diamond pro that well but it's diamond pearl is way better than Ruby and Sapphire was just right you're right yeah so they showed their starters here and I like being right on the show mmm I like to throw that in people's faces I'm sorry that doesn't happen so I it yeah it happens very rarely I was very confident that the names i read off last week with my cat when Travis wasn't here with Micah and well fairly confident those names were not going to be the English names because I butcher every Pokemon name but those names were very hard to say and we did get new names but what people speculated the animals that these Pokemon are based on or some being inanimate objects like vanilluxe the animals that people speculated we're pretty close to right we'll start with uh Lytton first which is the fire cat Pokemon did you start with like the worst of them all at least we can agree on that yeah have some fighting words here already the description we have some fire fighting words here that the pokemon company has provided the cool-headed Firecat Pokemon Lytton is the next choice for a first partner Pokemon next choice probably because I mixed up the order here Linton's fur is rich in oils and is immensely flammable it constantly grooms itself by licking its coat collecting loose fur in two balls it then ignites these hair balls to create fireball attacks when the time comes for a little tumult it burns off all of its fur in one glorious blaze cats don't molt well that's disgusting this one does it started from greasy it's starting to ember it's just a plain fire type and yeah well we'll get to we'll get to all of these in a second here we'll just kind of go through the second one I have on the list is pop Papa leo Pope Leo the Pope of Pope town Papa Leo Pope won't even eat the Popo the buff you know Vatican City Pope tone he's the puppet poke down oh he's the Pope of pokes it is the sea lion Pokemon straight water starting move water gun the third possibility is the this mean not turning off my text messages shameful is a sea lion Pokemon populi Oh populo can create balloons made of water from its nose and utilize them to create a variety of different strategies and attacks in battle this Pokemon is better at moving on in the water than on land it can swim at speeds over 25 miles per hour that is American for those listening on land it uses the electricity of this balloons to create it creates to perform jumps and our acrobatic stunts see it's name is just here's here's the magic its name is very similar to squirtle right because squirtle is a squirrel and a turtle that squirts and pop Leo is our pop y ou is a puppy and a sea lion that pops balloons it's perfect I squirtle supposed to be a squirrel it's in the squirrel tail dude yeah its tail's a squirrel tail for sure I guess I never made that connection I just thought it was squirt because it squirted and it was a turtle yes squirrel and it's hurdle and it squirts I mean okay we'll get we'll get back to all these will do it will go in depth with said Pokemon the last one is well she'll end up with gent one Pokemon because all of these names are new to me squirt a square what ah the last one is route rowlett is that how we're saying it romia Rao like it's an owl's it so roll it okay it's a round outlet Oh his name is Charlie I suppose the round would make sense it is the grass quill pokemon isn't not to derail here but is it quad Elian a quill it up one quill at it I'm getting there Oh Travis pull that up it is a grass flying-type pokemon i if I'm not mistaken it is the first duel type since Bulbasaur of at least a first stage right first stage starter because I Torchic was just pure fire even though it turned into a abomination of a fighting pokemon will attend was the spiny armor Pokemon okay is it's not gone ah rowlett is the first of okay again I got these out of orders rowlett this Pokemon can fly silently throughout the skies sneaking up on its opponent without being noticed it can attack its opponents using powerful kicks and it has no legs powerful kicks and it can also attack from a distance using its razor-sharp leaves that form parts of its feathers rowlett can survey its environment and turn its neck nearly 180 degrees from 180 degrees American for those measuring from front to back it can also see directly behind itself when in petal well it turns its head to face its trainer when waiting for instructions ah there you go what's cool about that is that there are species of owls that will like sneak up on prey and then eat them like yeah well I mean that's like what everything does but specifically this some species of all that sneak behind pray and then like slam into the back of the head of of either prey or things that are threatening to them like they do it to people sometimes they like will knock out the thing and so I think that's what they're supposed to be showing with rowlett kicking really hard that's a lot of assumption but sure gross i think because i think they kick i think that those owls do it by kicking too did you see the gift of the owl eating the rabbit you mean the right at oh no it's just uh no like a lopunny and now we'll eating a lopunny it's super gross because you only see the background on the love bunny house and they let me post it in the chat don't I probably now you cuz the link not that chat the skype chat so only you guys can see the horror nothing uh well if you post it in the twitch chat I'm Giroux can approve it drew is hanging up place but drew should not approve it uh uh let's let's go in depth with with these Pokemon where do you guys won do you just want to get ral it out of the way I feel like rally yeah I do all right well before we do that I ran a poll on our Twitter which Pokemon Sun and Moon starter is for you with 407 votes litton got thirty-seven percent rowlett got forty five percent and if you're counting American percentages Papa Leo that eighteen percent and cool pop Leo pop fly 00 polio Oh polio so I feel like there's there's a one Pokemon in every generation that kind of gets left behind I think we can all agree that Bulbasaur was that in generation one chart wig was that in generation three I feel Turtwig was a fourth trend starter Oh fourth gym sorry mmm they wrote a book about cast a popular seems to be the one left out here ah but I would argue though that last generation Generation X and Y 66 they all kind of had a really good balance but even before that generation 5 I feel like snivy was the one kind of left out yeah nobody wanted miss naívi so but I feel like that you're I think you're definitely right on that Gen 6 was pretty the starters were pretty equal in popularity like I really like froakie a lot of people really like chespin but then also a lot of people really liked um fennekin yes I think they each had their like strong mm-hmm fan bases and I think Jen five was similar i don't i don't think that many people hated snivy as much as like you know no one picks chikorita and jen to for example hey hey right you got like chikorita a lot it's probably a neighborhood of those three but i know a lot of people don't like it yeah I liked I liked chikorita to UM my first impressions when I I you know slept in I knew the Pokemon news was coming I wasn't like eager or like I need to wake up for this because I mean Pokemon podcast is not the first to deliver news and it's fine like where we we've gotten past that not the first delivered news but where you'd like talk about it which is more than you know okay this website posted the news you're done we're here to talk about it we're here to continue talking about it that's what we do I didn't rush to post the news so I woke up to a bunch of tweets and everything and the slack community very like like as soon as I started tweeting like the slack community was like a high-speed Jays tweeting witches was cool like yeah but I and right texted you and I was like dude what's up I was sleepin man okay so uh breaking news Pokemon podcasts not the first to deliver so I woke up to Irene texting me that there was a cat starter Pokemon and I was both excited like a kid on Christmas because I love cats I have three of them here at my house but I was also super scared because when i think of cat pokemon i think of / ugly and I know people like / ugly but prefer ugly is not for me sweet likes / ugly David tonight David really likes / ugly I like I think probably school yeah what as a cat lover you like and don't like certain types of cats like I don't like naked cats or those like hairless cats whatever they're called and I know people love lexus or whatever so if you if I was like oh man if the star pokemons a naked cat I'm sure people would flip out because people like those but I don't and like Prague we finally have why don't they have one of those why don't they have like a rex cat folk wanna be awesome like a little Egyptian theme I think of when I think kind of cans but yeah I can think like a ground-type yeah so when I saw Lytton I think the name is awesome even though some people were complaining that it's close to litleo and oh yeah Greg is telling me it's Fink's cat not Rex cat I got the it was a difference what is it Rep isn't a rex cat something to whatever I mean I live it but I don't know my my Laurent kids litton obviously kitten lit fire I don't know if there's any other puns in that name at all some people were upset that I saw that litton was very close to litleo and that not only in names but like we uh litleo evolves into a lie and minds are based on cats this is another cat lions are based on cats live your life animal lion what break you in a taste like cats were so big that you know they they came up with lions after that ah we are we going to top this with cat to lion ah my guess based on Linton's design is that Linton will evolve into more of a tiger than a lion we kind of have three lions at this point we have n ty we have pyroar and we have that new one which does not have a name we don't have any Tiger pokemon and tigers are very different than cats when I was a kid you know I always thought tigers were the female lions but they could do that actually I think it actually works yeah ligers everyone was like losing their minds over it when uh what is that movie that one about the vote for pedro or whatever with that movie man I holy dynamite yeah Napoleon Dynamite he talks about a lagger for like 10 minutes that may be so boring really know what is the what is the black cat calls Lytton oh no no no the black the big black one the big black one Persian like it's up its up there with pains and tigers Panthers do you mean like that you'll like that's what that's what Lytton is going to be a pant I would I get that but the market but the markings on lytton are kind of evocative tell your stripes yeah none the other people are speculating that Lytton will be a fire dark I mean I can see that it's black a lot of cats are black I think now it's not that nasty look in its eye it's like I mean it has like the stereotypical like I'm a smug cat look and I don't care yeah but like Esper didn't look smug and that's a cat yeah but Esper was like the derpy like Esper was like mean cat like to me this is like like stereotypical like black cat mm-hmm we can come back to that if we have more thoughts and lytton let's do rowlett here obviously the most popular the the Charmander of generation 7 clearly yes i'm trying to think of this might be the most popular grass starter of all time at this point even more than chest in well yeah I mean maybe just in terms of like the press like our poll is not really representative because our poll is of people that are already definitely into Pokemon because why would they be following us if they weren't that's what they like but like anyone who has any kind of close relationship to Pokemon might follow the Pokemon Twitter account and I think on their poll rowlett was like slightly ahead of lytton as opposed to NARS was a bigger margin polygon also ran a poll obviously that's just a general video game website and their percentages matched our percentages pretty closely but yeah I would assume the Pokemon Twitter would have more of a even top pull up those numbers so and so that I'm not just getting it out there i remember i didn't mention this but Rawat's starting move is leaf achai believe is a brand new move mmm that's correct translates as this leaf in Japanese from the Japanese okay not that leaf or exactly I thought it was this leaf I said not that leaf because it's this sort of the joke i was making so again for my first impressions well as i looked at it and I was not disappointed with what I saw I looked at Rao rowlett I was like wow that looks really cool like I actually didn't see the leaf boat I at first until somebody pointed it out and I saw populi Oh Papa Leo Popo and I was like it's fine and I moved on and I'll get back to that in a second but the amount of memes were internet gifs and well I guess you can't have gifs off the internet breaking news maybe you can't add softly net but I can um I was just surprised how much momentum came behind rowlett so fast and that's not a bad thing again like I'm glad like I'm actually happy that like a grass starters getting a lot of attention because I feel like the grass starters are the ones that are forgotten about and the flying-type started haha the and I'll throw it to you guys before I share my opinions but obviously I think will is both of you guys are on Team rowlett right I'm undecided I mean I really like that papaleo just because that little animation they showed and he's like he just like stands up and he like has this like proud smile on his face and then he's like I'm going to squirt at you and like Bree it's real cute I would like my relatives my definite favorite I would like pop bleh Oh more but there's Anna it's probably just me but there's something weird to me about how Papa Leah's snout is like perfectly conical I realize it's supposed to sort of be invoking like a party hat or whatever or like I don't know just the fact that see lines in like shows will like hairy balls on their noses or whatever but like that's what it is but it like when it's not moving and you can't see how it relates to the rest of its head it looks like I it looks like that's where its faces and all of its faces there and its nostrils are its eyes and it confuses me and so then therefore I don't it's it looks like an abomination to me and I don't like it you Wow I i think what what doesn't do I realize it's just me and Iran say but no I think I think you're right to some extent I think what doesn't do popular justice is its perspective like if you look at just its fins in the basic picture it looks like that it was drawn just quickly or poorly and like you look at rowlett and at least in the the default images I'm talking about you look at rowlett and he has like he's around he's like compact he's cute he has the shading like you get everything in one like you get that cute ball package and then you look at litton and you you he's like drawn out as a cat he's walked like he has that cat perspective and then you look at papaleo which is a combination of a sea lion and a puppy and you're like I kind to see the puppy and I kind of see the sea lion but like what's going on with its mermaid tail like it doesn't know it's a clown it just doesn't like his like lower half of his body just doesn't look finished and if you look at pop low and other pictures he actually looks a lot better than like the standard PNG picture that Pokemon provided everyone let's oh yes PNG a file format those only can I also exist on the internet PNG's it or know you and maybe in your internet um can you explain what you meant about rowlett shading what like his like shading I must as own now is I was nothing that is his like shading in his picture like like from his bowtie below it's darker and it gives you like a sense of him being more round and that's what I mean like with it it's just like more design it's just the perspective that they drew Papa Leo at I think doesn't do it justice to others I'm going backwards but I was talking about pokemons poll earlier the numbers there are 41 percent rowlett 38% Lytton 21-percent papaleo so the difference between relat and lytton with only three percent okay I'm popular had a little bit more because i think our poll is eighteen percent uh yeah so popular obviously the the odd man out here even polygon I don't know why we're bringing polygonal on well it's just me they ran like they did a whole article about the starter Pokemon and like they asked everyone that worked at poppy lot haha Polly Papalii gone plan is working well they're gonna love pop fly out what their favorites was and they pulled it up in rowlett one but I think only one or two people said pop Leo and it was just like look at populo he's just the joke of this generation and if you look it I hope that's not the case and it's it's funny because when you look at when you look at X and why I was so team chespin until I saw chestnut and until I saw delphox and also after i saw delphox i was like no fennekin a hundred percent and I I just not that I'm like rooting for a specific Pokemon this generation but I just hope that the final evolutions don't like ruin the image that we're seeing now like populo I don't think could get any worse oh we could get where you say that now did you see the internet art of pop y ou turning into a juggalo did you know how difficult it was for me to have to explain to my co-workers what a juggalo is because they had never heard of to thing oh I'm from Michigan so that there I live in their home turf you probably have a go in your refrigerator right now I don't cuz I don't really drink pop but if I did I probably would have fade you don't really drink soda I'm from Michigan I don't know if it's forgot that now I don't know no bueno here's the one upset the Juggalos man oh my god the purge [ __ ] you know like I actually like don't really know that much about what juggalos care about so do juggalos listen to the show are there any way we are Travis I want to delivery wrapped chocolate I want to know if there are any juggalo listeners to the show and I want to know what starter the enjoy so please like we know that down with a pop lie oh yeah I out yeah that's what I want to know ah the next the next this kind of just carries the conversation a little further uh I saw a lot on Twitter that like people weren't feeling these starters not a lot but you know it's it stands out when somebody's like like I don't like any of these starters or like we can go back to pop Leo and go like I hate popular those design like has I've been asked that question at like live shows like which Pokemon do you do you not like and that's very hard for me to answer because i don't know i like all like if I was the pick and probably be bascal in because I know the history of baskin I know bass k'lon was only created because they needed more water pokemon and that frustrates me because I think I want to believe that Pokemon puts a lot of thought in all their pokemon but we know baskin ahead 0 thought and it frustrates me so yes I i dislike bass Kalin but I don't know like I it's hard for me to dislike any of these pokemon it's hard for me to dislike like chikorita even though like trigger is not my favorite but what are you guys as thoughts um I actually saw the opposite on Twitter I saw a lot of people saying man I haven't liked all three starters in a long time and I think all three of these look really good and that like people are super excited that it's kind of a solid core for this new game it's hard for me to like it's difficult to judge from this group what the the feel of Pokemon designs is going to be for this generation I feel like I feel like Jen yeah it was gen 5 and did some extension six is good too but Jennifer in that sense to you but Jen five had a very strong design philosophy I feel like that all of those pokemon feel like with the exception of like heat more which feels like it belongs in a different universe pretty much all the general jun 5 Pokemon to me feel like they belong in the same region and I I and I can't like put a finger on what that commonality is but I haven't quite felt the same out of just and I mean I'm sure I'll change my mind when I see more pokemon in these three but I haven't really felt I'm gonna figure out what the common link is between I've I've heard like people talk about like oh maybe they'll all evolved into carnival like things like a tiger jumping through fire and it's gonna always yasir yes growl it with the bow tie is gonna be like ringleader but in terms of the design philosophy the entire generation it's obviously not we're going to have an entire generation of circus pokemon although that would be stellar hello and pokemon then confirmed yep although we already have one we do done no I hasn't donphan he's not like a real elephant like elephants are super big I mean like a normal type elephant yeah like I'm onion-like Mamoswine sighs I was about I was about to say elefante I mean I remember the deaths in neo pad speaking of Pokemon designs and I have to agree with Travis hundred percent i think pokemon designs are heavily based on the region they are this region which is officially confirmed is the ole ola myself like a like a like aloha which you would say to welcome or say goodbye to somebody in hawaii except it's a lo lot a lo lot so it's the aloe la región not confirmed hawaii but like basically but basically hawaii which now goes back to I so accessible to say Polynesia yeah okay which goes back to the the one-word answer of what to expect in the nice pokemon game which was that word was flowers I think Hawaii region fits that really well since I'm assuming this the the media of like when you get to why they give you flowers right away I'm I assume that still exists and some when they give you a lei yes yes sort of yes this is why I have you guys back me up we see some new characters we see obviously are our character both you know boy or girl and we see are you a boy or you girl we see our rival which I don't know if there's one or two but they only show a gentleman who is of darker-skinned who is your rival we everyone's assuming and we see somebody named holla and we see somebody named kooky am I saying those name Kukui Kukui uh oh wait who's holla how I was a bigger guy in the yellow shirt he's the one that all about the three of us yeah that's like the professor yeah so a lot of people thought I'm gonna what was that name koo koo koo koo e koo koo e everyone thought that was the professor because the lab coat kind of has like a professor Sycamore look a little bit looks like a little bit like jwittz if you follow hey whatz on twitter but i don't think he's the professor he'll he also calls you cousin in one of the trailers but uh yeah i think professor holla which is based off a tree it's actually based off a tree in hawaii if i'm not mistaken a hollow tree i'm not familiar with a hollow tree how does it spell this much sounds more like like a Jewish bread a day LA it could be the leaf on the tree but um yeah I mean not that I'm an expert in all things to lion but let's go to our resident button this button this will anderson I so if you if you type in halle tree in google it comes up with I'm just gonna slaughter this it comes up with the pandarus directory Oaks whatever you know scientific name you want that they are native plants in Hawaii holla is a choice tree for the essential Native Hawaiian landscape female trees with the characteristics of pineapple shaped fruit appear to be in more demand than the male trees now that I look at the picture of it yes that is a very familiar tree so I I did not know that it was called a holla but the scientific name for people who want to actually learn from our program is uh pandanus tect aureus there you go sounds like a dinosaur so you have oak Elm birch juniper Sycamore holla wait I got them all hey look at that if you want your child a Pokemon professor you have to change your last name to a tree why I'm dancing because I got all the Pokemon professor named successful thing I've done on this show so far I safe to say that the challah is the professor even though that's not confirmed but he gives you his pokemon and his name is based off a tree I think that's that's pretty pretty set here and he isn't sticking his belt he does have a stick what was I gonna say next let's talk about the legendaries here to legendaries the ones on the cover we have a giant white lion that looks like it's from power rangers and we have a giant purple bat that looks like it's from bayonetta what are your guys's yeah that's a fair I don't see Bayonetta in that I don't know in the colors and color sort of long like spindle e appendages I guess I guess hmm I like them both a lot I like the sort of negative space in the we don't know their names right there day I had no names no names I like some I know the other one is bat to batman batman bruce wayne uh I like Sir the how the shape of the bat makes sort of cool negative space but I i know that i'm getting sun so i have to by virtue of that I have to like the Sun one more so I like to lie in one more why are you why are you getting Sun because so do you want to see like what the sky look you see how like gray and gross that is that's I Michigan for like most of this country for a long time quick you know but you don't understand West West Michigan because we're right next to Lake Michigan it makes it such that unless it's like the middle of the summer it's it's never sunny so I need more Sun in my life so I'm buying Pokemon Sun I think that's a terrible reason I think it's the only reason than that uh speaking of which version you're getting I asked that on twitter as well based off the new legendary Pokemon which version of pokemon sun and moon are you getting 434 people answered thirty-three percent said Pokemon Sun twenty-nine percent said Pokemon moon thirty-eight percent are feeding right into Nintendo's marketing and getting booted a team Moon Man team moon uh I mean I resigned I've gotten both I've gotten both games of course I've fallen into that but as I've gotten older and less time in the world I can only realistic set it aside such childish thing yeah I have time one no good i think im gonna moments on just bit I the lion looks really cool i'll trade you a lion hahaha everybody's gonna get both it's just the one you get first it really matters that's when you actually pay attention to you while you're playing you're cheap you got me ah well you said you're getting moon d well what do you think of the designs though of these two pokeman oh I love the bat the bat that's incredible and that attack where it does and it's like all the light beams come from the little connectors that it's the yellow parts on the wings and then the light beams come and they focus on the middle and then a blast comes out from the middle of the bat you got to watch the video frame by frame like I've done um it's real good is real amazing it's almost as good actually it's actually better than oblivion wing and Oblivion wing had one of my favorite attack animations of all time so listen seriously like like the light comes and like swirls in and then it's like a blast from the center of the of the bat and the bat just like looks so glorious like rising up in this whatever that temple is where they find because you look in the background it's obviously like some sort of temple building and it just like rises up and its wings spread out and it's just like obviously this is pokemon moon and its glorious and you have to get that one a few I feel I was except that you don't accept I'm kidding I've committed to Pokemon Sun and the abilities bulbapedia has them I actually don't know where they got them from maybe just from the core core article but rowlett how will have over girl we'll have blazed and popular will have torrent I think these are all standard abilities for starters yeah nothing about any anything else hidden wise oh and that's actually that's pretty much all all the news that we got we can get to the elephant in the room of possibly this game having the elephant Ella elefante in the room where's the elephant of character in Steve's room not your right yes my cats are all named elephant the looks to be that we're going to get character customization again and poke that again in these games that were was first introduced in pokemon X&Y now if you look at the there there was two trailers that came out there was an English trailer and there was a Japanese trailer the Japanese trailer way better it does a lot with like playing with your emotions which oh dude I littered I cried because it reminded me when I like I cuz like I was um like five years old when I moved to Hawaii and it was like so much of me going to kindergarten like halfway through the year in going from New York to Hawaii and like having to meet new people and everything when I was just a little tiny little kid and there was no pokemon to Greece those deals so I was on my own my dad bought the wrong kind of sandals and that's like how many what thirty-eight years later I still remember that my dad bought the wrong kind of sandals and I was mocked at five years old in kindergarten for wearing weird Jesus shoes oh you got the I don't wear sandals sandals not see my dad being you know a New Yorker for his whole life when he went there and like called my mom and told her what to get us he said Oh everybody wears sandals in Hawaii what he meant was everybody wears flip-flops but the word flip-flop was not in his vocabulary yeah but anyways that Japanese commercial number one at no Japanese in it it actually had more english in it anything else and it's really moving yeah it did so the the Japanese video showed pretty much your your boy and your girl screen and then it showed different skin colors I'll and from what I remember it had a lot more variety in the color of the skin than x and y i did but i could be mistaken but i also read that it did have more variety that there were only three in x and y ok cool and then if then i watch the trailer over and over to see if that went more of an extent because a lot of people were like well you know skin color doesn't confirm character customization and the right but they're wrong and that's okay if in in the English trailer specifically the male protagonist is wearing a blue and white striped shirt which by the way in the Japanese trailer the little boy who's like the main star is wearing a blue and white stripes sure which I thought was a nice touch so the main protagonist is wearing a blue and white striped shirt he's wearing gray pants with red pockets and red cuffs there is one shot of the male protagonist in the English trailer who is wearing a black and white striped shirt and the same pants but the cuffs are instead lighter gray than the grayness of the pants which confirms that the pants are while the pants and the shorter exactly the same they're different colors now a lot of people were like oh that could have just been a mistake no it's absolutely not a mistake first off if you that same exact scene where the boy is wearing the black and white shirt is in the Japanese trailer the same exact scene except in the Japanese trailer this is turning into like a spare change documentary no this is like a conspiracy arrears that's what spare change clothes oh I was a document on the documentary about 911 write your notes machine was he's a herd of let me tell you about the elephant type pokemon that's coming so in the japanese trailer there is the same scene but he's wearing the normal blue and white shirt so i find it hard to believe that out of both trailers that one scene there was a mistake in colors especially when they already had that scene produced in the japanese trailer which what you're saying is jet fuel can't melt great oh my god i was gonna make that joke and you stole it from me dare you hundreds of said ah so you are daddy of hers pokemon podcast confirming character customization someone's correcting me that it's called loose change not spare change so and here's where you're wrong they just made it so that if you get the japanese version of the game you get a blue shirt and if you get the v english version of the game you get a black shirt and dad this generations version of vivian or however you know that doctor and whatever region you get you get a different color you did get you get the same gray pants but they're exited a different color ah i would be so surprised if character customization was not in these games yeah the fact that i mean the people sit who are resisting the conclusion that character creation is confirmed are doing so on the pretense that it's not a hundred percent confirmed and like sure i mean i guess that's that's correct right you could also make me I mean that like Hawaii is not confirmed or halle is not the professor but I mean right right it's a Pokemon game it's it's not that in depth and do you like it would be okay Game Freak in the pokemon company have made some interesting decisions before but to give us character customization in Gen 6 have that be like the most hated part of oris the fact that it's not there anymore and then bring it part of the way back in jan 7 which in this in the I mean like I think the ability to choose between different skin colors is probably the most important part of character customization in pokemon but to have just that one segment of it would be very strange by think people are always going to complain because you don't have that extent of character customization that you have in say like a destiny or the fallout or something like that or Final Fantasy 14 where you can like change the nose and change the chin and change the facial hair and team well then the Elder Scrolls where you can just make a nightmare creature isn't Elder Scrolls just the game where you steal things up people's tables yup that why are we talking about that garbage um so I mean people are always going to be dissatisfied because like even Monster Hunter has more customization than you'll typically find it yeah my game so I think that's that I think that's the standard and the voice we should have as fans of the series is to demand more right like I want that character like the fact that we're getting more shades of skin colors already like a super big plus like right and probably it is due to the fact that people were very disappointed when that didn't return in oras yeah as long as I can get haircuts I'm fine you know some people care about hair some people care about skin color but hopefully it has it both alright when I have my girl character i want to have cute outfits for her that's fair i want to have the cutest of outfits for everyone the last thing i want to talk about before we read i actually didn't think this show would go so long but you know it's for all week and to all a good week 11 to one more little thing one more little thing about character customization that which you may not notice that you have a full-sized trainer throughout like when you're walking around and in the battles which in x and y you kind of got the shrunk drown trainer in the overworld which is a term i can't believe i'm using so it makes character customization that much better you have for you have full size this is the second week in a row i'm making hamburger fingers yeah in the overworld as opposed to a shrunk down trainer so you get your character customization is more legit has more value yes ah it looks so we saw footage of the game it looks that it it looks like it's running the Omega Ruby alpha sapphire engine which was based off the black and white engine but it actually looks slightly different which could just mean a brand new engine I don't know why they would just change the character in the engine oh no did you also see the way that he like there's part where he's on a path and he's running up and at an angle like you would never have had that in x and y that mean that kind of like a curved up and angle so that's yeah that look at the watch live it's right after Kakui welcomes him to a lola and you can see he's like running past a trainer so he must have just had a trainer battle and he's slowing up a hill it's on a ridge there's water on the other side but it's definitely like a curved angular up like up and to the left up another come up with your lovely job that you guys have no III don't took me a second we got haha alright last thing i want to talk about is the abbreviation of sun and moon i see a lot of people using capital s lowercase u capital m lowercase oh that's awesome forces no no I'm not approving of this laying down the ban hammer wish the slack community saw today oh we don't call diamond and pearl died pie we don't call red blue and yellow red blue yet it's red blue yellow are be why diamond pearl is just DP sun and moon sm i can't say why that's wrong because this is a kid-friendly show see if you know why this is roll let's back it up let's back it up it is not s and M it's not Pokemon so boom it's not he's right he's right it's not you sit you D&P it's just D P and D P stands for a lot of bad things besides dr. pepper let me tell you are not tearing SNM I'm saying sm smooth milk Sun and Moon it's not Rhett it's not R&B and why it's RB why red blue yellow yeah yeah true one that's true hgss heartgold soulsilver it's not hng & S & S & S & S & hgss like what I don't this is what I'm putting down the ban hammer I don't know why people decided to put the and between Sen because the and was never there for the first now that's true kwani Pokemon games like no one ever put me and between gold and silver it was just always GAO su mo is clever cuz it's like it's clever work but we like we didn't need that for any other game like like I said diamond and pearl is not d IP you had to innovate before we add no idea what to do in black 2 and white 2 halo I will also be 2w to uh remind our listeners that this argument is coming from a man who got angry literally angry because the word Thunder exists when it's just the sound that lightning makes yes is a hot dog a sandwich you know what makes a chair chair button it yeah you're you're especially sad Travis is sitting in his bed Thunder I I don't I only chair was in this room of this releasing the argument was lightning makes a sound the sound of lightning like that statement is valid because lightning makes a sound but yeah but the sound of a foot hitting the ground does a stop like there's other there's other things that happen there's other aesthetic experiences that are purely sound that we make words for no no no I agree i'm just saying that it's it's not wrong for me to say lightning makes a sound because people correct you and they go you mean Thunder like well if anyone corrects you or something like that their parents and their annoying like you don't have to say it's lightning and thundering you could just say it there's lightning outside because because people actually don't say that they say it's thunder and lightning yeah but you don't Harry very right Thunder happens regardless of if you hear it or not migration to the choir did you just hear and talk over I like I don't even know if I'm pointing at spj I just point you have talked over my reference to UM that song oh my god what is the name of the song Bohemian Rhapsody what one hey Meenakshi has tested positive lightning my finding me Galileo oh hey you may have just cracked the code Thunderbolts thunderbolts are lightning Thunderbolt are lightning they're not the noise they are very very frightening I can't mean like a cat meows a dog barks let nning makes thunder but to say like that muse my only by only point was you you don't always have to say it's lightning and thunder like you'd like yes you see a dog you don't have to tell me that it barks I know that it barks I know that lightning makes a sound and I know that sounds Thunder so to say it's lightning and thunder thundering is redundant because lightning makes Thunder Thunder would not exist without lightning is running the show on that in next week's episode of it's super effective we read Friedrich Nietzsche's on truth and falsity in their extra moral sense join us then join us then I I think the I think the Sun and Moon conversation was productive I think we got a lot of the way I heard that there's going to be another snippet of news weather how big or small it is i'm assuming it's going to be on the smaller side that is supposed to come on friday so we will Travis will be out of town but will and I will probably record something on sunday as we do normally I don't know if this will go up now sumo is wrong Greg its SM SM if you want to put the end in there you know I'm not gonna I'm gonna laugh but SM is fine d p GS hgss 0 ras yeah you don't say or is you say horas because it's the thing you can say so it's where we've deviated before and I was trying to get oars to go through no no you don't ya because okay all right okay with breaking the rules then because that was clever then sumo is clever now no sumo is no no but there's no there's no point for the you or the oh there's just no yeah they really are pointless like if there was multiple Pokemon games that started with an S or an M and everybody's like sumo is a word you can pronounce you know what's another thing you can pronounce you could say smooth if you get in a ball you thought oh I'm bottle the bottle catch up and look as I don't want kids googling Pokemon SNM no one puts the and in there though that's that's the point I'm trying to make no one when you google heartgold soulsilver you don't Google Hg and SS you don't put the and in there right sumo sumo like when your surgical red blue know is you done to say and it's more fun to say than sm right well I now I posit this make it ms pokemon ms and just say ms like like it's it's an armed indicated indicative of whether it's married or single that's fine The Scream on biz that's it spoken we can reach that compromise it's miss pokemon right i mean like an x and y is a good example pokemon XY x and why hi guys what I'm just saying I think we as a community on the side on one term and I'm strongly behind this is a little higher but we can only decide on one term we cannot have multiple cannot have chaos and the universe has decided on Pokemon sumo I like the you are put the universe did decide on Pokemon sumo but there is a lot of debate of not using suma anymore as decided on the ever so popular reddit we have our / Nintendo our / 3ds and r / Pokemon all now getting rid of sumo because of the arguments I made today not I'm not saying I'm the leader behind this but I'm saying this never used an in the past we've never used a second characters of a Pokemon game as in you and oh in the past why are we using it now just because it's a fun word to say yes debate it also the only reason I'm bringing this up is because it's something to talk about so if you guys want a shorter show that's fine we're compliant you are complaining about had ants and who has now become the ultimate pet and I I mean if I didn't complain about something this be a pretty boring show now I'd be complaining about something so that's true that's true one of us has to have a sand in our something but at the end of there's a snake in my buddy at the end of the day I don't really care about it well I think never I think it wraps it up for your show if you want to follow Travis at d travis w on twitter if you want to follow will at wash in the sink if you want to follow me at dragonlake this if you missed the earlier part of the show it will be on iTunes later this week and we will be back to our sunday schedule coming up on Sunday so this has been another episode of its soup wait hold on messed that up this is why we don't do these things live this has been another episode of the Pokemon podcast and we are super effector sumos I got it in last yes it's there's a standby button here there
