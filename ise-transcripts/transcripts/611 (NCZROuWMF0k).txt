me is (0:24 - 0:29)
Hannah hello I I am here I did get a (0:25 - 0:32)
Raichu (0:29 - 0:34)
oh I wasn't completely sure at the (0:32 - 0:36)
beginning of the week but I feel like (0:34 - 0:39)
probably everyone did if if anyone who (0:36 - 0:43)
tried yeah I think it was well any (0:39 - 0:45)
before we get to the Pokemon sleep (0:43 - 0:50)
segment Bobby also here hello I am a (0:45 - 0:54)
sleep expert now thanks to Pokemon sleep (0:50 - 0:58)
so it's it's it's (0:54 - 1:04)
great it's one F perfect um yeah so we (0:58 - 1:06)
have uh we're going to start off with (1:04 - 1:08)
Pokemon sleep of course it's raicho week (1:06 - 1:09)
if you're listening to this there will (1:08 - 1:13)
be another week of raicho week uh there (1:09 - 1:14)
was a (1:13 - 1:18)
new Pokemon thingy found called Pokemon (1:14 - 1:20)
Works we're going to talk about that not (1:18 - 1:21)
that there's much to talk about there (1:20 - 1:24)
but uh I can I can Yap for a half hour (1:21 - 1:27)
about one sentence so possible uh (1:24 - 1:29)
there's some TCG news and Bobby knows (1:27 - 1:32)
all about that that with the temp (1:29 - 1:33)
temporal (1:32 - 1:36)
forces uh and then there's some new (1:33 - 1:39)
Pokémon Go stuff so that's our episode (1:36 - 1:44)
for the week um if you don't connect to (1:39 - 1:46)
the internet you'll still be able to (1:44 - 1:48)
have your mass outbreaks for (1:46 - 1:52)
babies uh that still go in uh although I (1:48 - 1:54)
don't (1:52 - 1:57)
know I I guess I guess we'll wake up (1:54 - 1:58)
tomorrow and see if there's a new Raid (1:57 - 2:02)
event or not but this up coming week is (1:58 - 2:04)
euic uh which is a pretty big tournament (2:02 - 2:06)
so I don't know if they would run a raid (2:04 - 2:08)
event over that but actually now that (2:06 - 2:10)
you say that they're like put everything (2:08 - 2:12)
yeah what are you talking about this is (2:10 - 2:15)
the company that puts everything (2:12 - 2:18)
together so I would I would assume if (2:15 - 2:20)
there is another sevenstar raid now that (2:18 - 2:23)
they're done with the like Kanto (2:20 - 2:25)
starters to celebrate Pokemon day it (2:23 - 2:26)
would probably be (2:25 - 2:29)
primarina uh because they were going in (2:26 - 2:30)
Elite 4 order I don't know if people (2:29 - 2:34)
notice that but Crispen had (2:30 - 2:37)
Blazin which was first and then what was (2:34 - 2:42)
her name amoris Amor she had um imp poon (2:37 - 2:43)
and (2:42 - 2:46)
so oh gosh what is her name the Clay's (2:43 - 2:47)
daughter (2:46 - 2:51)
uh not Lily it's not Lily but it starts (2:47 - 2:54)
with L yeah Lacy Lacy has primarina so (2:51 - 2:56)
should primarina should be next and then (2:54 - 2:59)
septile should be after that and then (2:56 - 3:02)
who knows when incin and the rest of (2:59 - 3:05)
those come but I I would assume they (3:02 - 3:07)
would finish the Elite 4 since they (3:05 - 3:09)
started the Elite 4 you'd think that (3:07 - 3:12)
would make sense yeah unless there's (3:09 - 3:15)
like day of the big wrestling cat coming (3:12 - 3:17)
up and they're (3:15 - 3:21)
gonna is that a national holiday in my (3:17 - 3:24)
house it (3:21 - 3:24)
is all right let's get to our Pokemon (3:25 - 3:30)
sleep news um all right I got a riko (3:27 - 3:32)
Hannah got a raicho the question of the (3:30 - 3:35)
hour is did Bobby who just started (3:32 - 3:38)
Pokemon sleep a week ago did you get (3:35 - 3:41)
raicho I did I did get a raicho as well (3:38 - 3:47)
nice yes yes yep I did um dang okay and (3:41 - 3:49)
no one used their master ball or did we (3:47 - 3:53)
I did I did use a Master oh you did wait (3:49 - 3:55)
so did you have enough points to buy the (3:53 - 3:58)
master ball yeah and then some so (3:55 - 4:00)
because like the intro of theame G gave (3:58 - 4:03)
you let me let's just start this whole (4:00 - 4:04)
thing off with I have not spent any (4:03 - 4:07)
money on this game cuz I know that that (4:04 - 4:09)
was a question important clarification (4:07 - 4:12)
yes so I have spent zero dollar on this (4:09 - 4:14)
game however I did sign up for the (4:12 - 4:19)
premium like trial on last Sunday good (4:14 - 4:24)
time to sign up yeah so optim optimized (4:19 - 4:27)
Bobby um and and if I'm being honest (4:24 - 4:29)
once the two weeks is up I will probably (4:27 - 4:31)
continue (4:29 - 4:33)
at least like the first like six months (4:31 - 4:36)
for the premium cuz I do I am actually (4:33 - 4:38)
excited about playing this game which I (4:36 - 4:40)
was not sure if I would be but after (4:38 - 4:43)
playing for a couple weeks now uh I I (4:40 - 4:44)
think it actually made it on my home (4:43 - 4:47)
screen the app is on my home screen so (4:44 - 4:49)
say way after you barely gave it the (4:47 - 4:51)
time of day when it first came out I I (4:49 - 4:53)
had a very bad first experience with (4:51 - 4:54)
that game when it first came out because (4:53 - 4:58)
of the way that I slept or something and (4:54 - 5:00)
the the Pokeball Plus or the Pokemon go (4:58 - 5:03)
Plus+ like messed up and it just gave me (5:00 - 5:06)
a bad first experience so uh yeah um but (5:03 - 5:09)
yeah I did use a Master biskuit for for (5:06 - 5:10)
my (5:09 - 5:13)
REO CU you got the the free incense or (5:10 - 5:14)
whatever well everyone got a free (5:13 - 5:17)
incense yes so free incense free free (5:14 - 5:20)
REO biscuit right we got that for the (5:17 - 5:22)
that was because of the bug where it was (5:20 - 5:24)
only giving you like the onear Sleep (5:22 - 5:26)
style or something like that yeah okay (5:24 - 5:29)
so we had we had two bugs yeah the F (5:26 - 5:31)
okay so I want to (5:29 - 5:33)
we have Pokemon go later on in the show (5:31 - 5:36)
I do want to say that like this is the (5:33 - 5:37)
thing I've been thinking about more and (5:36 - 5:40)
more often and I don't play Cafe remix (5:37 - 5:43)
enough to know how buggy that game is (5:40 - 5:45)
right like I I like I I do know that the (5:43 - 5:49)
economy in Cafe remix is more atrocious (5:45 - 5:52)
than Pokemon go like Pokemon go say what (5:49 - 5:54)
you will about (5:52 - 5:57)
it maybe remote raid remote raid pass is (5:54 - 5:59)
a little expensive pokeballs expensive (5:57 - 6:00)
but like (5:59 - 6:04)
the Eon like it doesn't feel like you (6:00 - 6:06)
things are that expensive like if you (6:04 - 6:08)
wanted to upgrade your bag or if you (6:06 - 6:10)
wanted to upgrade your inventory or you (6:08 - 6:12)
wanted to buy like a 10 pack of (6:10 - 6:14)
incubators whenever they have certain (6:12 - 6:15)
sales (6:14 - 6:20)
like but when Pokemon go has an issue (6:15 - 6:24)
which is often their compensation (6:20 - 6:30)
is awful awful terrible if it exists mhm (6:24 - 6:32)
like we joke about like so what okay so (6:30 - 6:35)
go flipping back to Pokemon sleep the (6:32 - 6:37)
first issue was on Sunday night for a (6:35 - 6:41)
lot of non-asian people you couldn't (6:37 - 6:43)
collect ingredients or berries if you (6:41 - 6:46)
did the game would give you an error and (6:43 - 6:48)
then it would kick you (6:46 - 6:51)
out and it was a server side issue I (6:48 - 6:53)
think it had to do with like how Asia (6:51 - 6:56)
already was getting Rao but America and (6:53 - 6:57)
UK didn't so that's where that issue (6:56 - 7:01)
came in and (6:57 - 7:04)
uh you could you could still like give R (7:01 - 7:06)
you could still give Snorlax dinner and (7:04 - 7:08)
go to bed you just couldn't click (7:06 - 7:10)
collect berries or ingredients so when (7:08 - 7:13)
you woke up it was fixed they without an (7:10 - 7:15)
update or anything they fixed it server (7:13 - 7:21)
side and um they gave everyone a premium (7:15 - 7:24)
biscuit in the game which is a good (7:21 - 7:26)
reward especially for raicho week that (7:24 - 7:27)
was their compensation but when they (7:26 - 7:30)
fixed it they made a new issue which was (7:27 - 7:32)
you could only get one of the Sleep (7:30 - 7:35)
style of raicho because there's three (7:32 - 7:39)
sleep Styles the funny thing is 99% of (7:35 - 7:41)
people wouldn't have been able to get (7:39 - 7:43)
the second sleep style unless they were (7:41 - 7:46)
like a hardcore whale but instead (7:43 - 7:48)
because like you need to be like rank (7:46 - 7:49)
nine master rank nine to get the first (7:48 - 7:51)
one you need to be like master rank what (7:49 - 7:53)
15 to get the second one and then master (7:51 - 7:57)
rank 19 to get the third one so in like (7:53 - 7:59)
a 24-hour period that would have been (7:57 - 8:02)
like possible unless you just kept (7:59 - 8:04)
buying whistles I (8:02 - 8:09)
guess maybe not impossible but yeah so (8:04 - 8:11)
but they compensated everyone with (8:09 - 8:15)
another biscuit and a raicho incense (8:11 - 8:17)
like the compensation and this is like (8:15 - 8:19)
they have had a really good history of (8:17 - 8:21)
like when they have an issue which (8:19 - 8:24)
is not uncommon like I feel like there (8:21 - 8:26)
has been quite a few issues in Pokemon (8:24 - 8:29)
sleep it's just like people don't care (8:26 - 8:31)
as much because their (8:29 - 8:35)
Rewards or they like I'm sorry is good (8:31 - 8:36)
it's like a good I'm sorry and it (8:35 - 8:38)
doesn't really cost them anything and (8:36 - 8:42)
it's quick too so I mean I think so (8:38 - 8:45)
there was I think one of the (8:42 - 8:47)
bugs they actually cre decided to create (8:45 - 8:51)
an event so isn't it like the 30th and (8:47 - 8:54)
the 31st of March is going to be 1.5 dry (8:51 - 8:57)
power 1.5 times drowsy power for one of (8:54 - 8:59)
those things and that happened immed (8:57 - 9:00)
they immediately announced that they (8:59 - 9:03)
were like we're sorry here's a thing (9:00 - 9:06)
we're going to do in a week right and it (9:03 - 9:08)
was like (9:06 - 9:10)
immediately recording this on Saturday (9:08 - 9:13)
yeah and even then with the raicho (9:10 - 9:15)
biscuit and the incense I don't even (9:13 - 9:17)
know if I saw that they announced it I (9:15 - 9:19)
just happened to click something and it (9:17 - 9:21)
was like wait what I I have a raicho (9:19 - 9:23)
biscuit and a raicho incense like I (9:21 - 9:25)
didn't I didn't buy these and then I (9:23 - 9:27)
realized that they I was like oh they (9:25 - 9:29)
must have given these for the the Sleep (9:27 - 9:32)
Style incident that like you said I (9:29 - 9:34)
don't know if anybody would have noticed (9:32 - 9:36)
if they had just hadn't said something I (9:34 - 9:38)
mean maybe someone did maybe one of the (9:36 - 9:41)
people the whales that bought bajillion (9:38 - 9:44)
whistles did say like this is weird but (9:41 - 9:46)
it was it was cool how quickly it (9:44 - 9:48)
happened because to your point with (9:46 - 9:50)
Pokemon go just because that's the other (9:48 - 9:54)
game I play uh not only does it is it (9:50 - 9:57)
are the apologies or like what they give (9:54 - 9:59)
it's not even that they need to give you (9:57 - 10:01)
a bunch of stuff but it's like the (9:59 - 10:03)
acknowledgement that something went (10:01 - 10:06)
wrong and then how quickly they want to (10:03 - 10:08)
fix that or how quickly they want to (10:06 - 10:11)
like give people something and you know (10:08 - 10:13)
as an apology or something it's just not (10:11 - 10:17)
nearly there with Pokemon go um so it (10:13 - 10:18)
was cool to see it like I was like oh it (10:17 - 10:20)
can happen like this in a game like (10:18 - 10:24)
games can actually have a good a good uh (10:20 - 10:26)
response to a bug that affects a bunch (10:24 - 10:29)
of people interesting like with with (10:26 - 10:31)
Niantic (10:29 - 10:31)
they would establish so much Goodwill (10:32 - 10:37)
like let's say let's say like there was (10:35 - 10:40)
like uh this week is tapu Lele let's say (10:37 - 10:42)
for whatever reason tapu Lele got turned (10:40 - 10:43)
off (10:42 - 10:45)
which the Shina got turned off people (10:43 - 10:48)
went out they did it they know which (10:45 - 10:50)
people participated in raids at what (10:48 - 10:52)
time right like they know that and in (10:50 - 10:53)
the past that has happened and their (10:52 - 10:56)
reward is like oh sorry trainers here's (10:53 - 11:00)
two raid passes and five silver pinap (10:56 - 11:02)
berries actually five silver pinap (11:00 - 11:03)
berries would be incredibly generous (11:02 - 11:05)
from n that's a lot not even a good (11:03 - 11:08)
reward but like in like instead they (11:05 - 11:11)
could just do a good reward like hey we (11:08 - 11:14)
saw that the average person did or like (11:11 - 11:16)
we saw you did three raids we're (11:14 - 11:18)
doubling it as an apology here's six (11:16 - 11:22)
raid passes it costs them nothing to (11:18 - 11:24)
like do that and to like reestablish (11:22 - 11:27)
that Goodwill because it's not like with (11:24 - 11:28)
Pokemon (11:27 - 11:30)
sleep (11:28 - 11:32)
99% of that game can be done from your (11:30 - 11:35)
bed but with like Pokemon go it's like (11:32 - 11:37)
requiring you to like go to a mall go to (11:35 - 11:40)
a park like drive somewhere walk (11:37 - 11:42)
somewhere wait what 1% of Pokemon sleep (11:40 - 11:45)
can't be done from your bed oh you know (11:42 - 11:46)
if you're doing you could be doing in (11:45 - 11:48)
the car too like you know driving yeah (11:46 - 11:51)
but you can 100% 100% play that game (11:48 - 11:54)
from your bed sure yeah I (11:51 - 11:57)
guess I don't like to commit 100% to my (11:54 - 12:00)
bed Bobby I'm you know I'm you got to do (11:57 - 12:01)
a little bit outside the (12:00 - 12:04)
[Laughter] (12:01 - 12:06)
bed but yeah it's like the Pokemon sleep (12:04 - 12:10)
team is trying to not be what Niantic (12:06 - 12:14)
is yeah it's almost like it's (12:10 - 12:14)
intentional but like there's so many (12:15 - 12:20)
instances where Pokemon go breaks and (12:17 - 12:21)
their reward (12:20 - 12:23)
compensation that first off it's like (12:21 - 12:25)
are they even going to apologize or (12:23 - 12:27)
acknowledge it yeah exactly are they (12:25 - 12:29)
going to acknowledge it are they going (12:27 - 12:30)
to acknowledge in a place where people (12:29 - 12:32)
can see it are they going to do anything (12:30 - 12:34)
about it and is that going to (12:32 - 12:39)
be good at all yeah I will I do like (12:34 - 12:42)
that the updates so I know this is kind (12:39 - 12:44)
of common with most of the games that (12:42 - 12:46)
are like Pokemon mobile games I think I (12:44 - 12:49)
think Pokemon go is kind of unique in (12:46 - 12:52)
this way that most of the games give you (12:49 - 12:54)
update notifications when you open the (12:52 - 12:56)
game right most Pokemon games do that (12:54 - 12:58)
Pokemon home does it poke it's not (12:56 - 12:59)
really Pokemon game but Pokemon home (12:58 - 13:01)
does it Pokemon sleep does it Pokemon (12:59 - 13:03)
duel used to do it Pokemon cafe remix (13:01 - 13:06)
does it Pokemon Master does it Masters (13:03 - 13:09)
does it like so when you open that game (13:06 - 13:11)
you're seeing those notifications update (13:09 - 13:13)
like there was a there was a bug update (13:11 - 13:17)
here's a apology whatever Pokemon go (13:13 - 13:19)
it's like you have do you have an X (13:17 - 13:21)
account because otherwise you have no (13:19 - 13:24)
idea that they're apologizing to you (13:21 - 13:26)
even you know even when like somebody (13:24 - 13:29)
sends a gift like somebody sent me the (13:26 - 13:32)
grout on raid thingy and this is part (13:29 - 13:34)
part of my fault I'm not going to blame (13:32 - 13:35)
Niantic on this but if you like click (13:34 - 13:38)
through too fast CU you're like opening (13:35 - 13:41)
the app you can't ever see who gifted (13:38 - 13:44)
you that gift it's like gone forever (13:41 - 13:45)
like when you would think that going (13:44 - 13:47)
into your inventory clicking the ticket (13:45 - 13:50)
would be like here pop the ticket up (13:47 - 13:52)
again the animation of like you're (13:50 - 13:54)
invited to groud on raid from so and so (13:52 - 13:57)
but it doesn't even do that to Bobby's (13:54 - 13:59)
point of like I didn't even see that (13:57 - 14:01)
they announced but I saw the raicho (13:59 - 14:04)
biscuit and the incense there's like a (14:01 - 14:09)
spot in both Pokemon Masters and Pokemon (14:04 - 14:13)
sleep where it'll say like bug (14:09 - 14:16)
compensation or like compensation of we (14:13 - 14:19)
had an issue sorry like we're sorry (14:16 - 14:21)
there's like no spot for that in Pokemon (14:19 - 14:24)
go um at (14:21 - 14:26)
all and I guess if there was a spot it (14:24 - 14:29)
would be frequently clicked on have so (14:26 - 14:32)
many issues but again I feel like now (14:29 - 14:35)
that we have Pokemon Masters is another (14:32 - 14:36)
good one they do have issues and they do (14:35 - 14:37)
have like bug compensation and they (14:36 - 14:39)
usually do it with gems and gems is what (14:37 - 14:42)
you just the currency in the game to (14:39 - 14:45)
just buy stuff but I I almost feel like (14:42 - 14:47)
there is a little bit of Goodwill for (14:45 - 14:49)
Niantic this these last couple months (14:47 - 14:52)
because they've like revive all um (14:49 - 14:55)
switched the Buddy easier like they they (14:52 - 14:58)
have been doing a lot of quality of life (14:55 - 15:00)
improvements but I think the biggest (14:58 - 15:02)
quality of life Improvement is just like (15:00 - 15:06)
look at these other games and copy that (15:02 - 15:07)
especially because like out of all of (15:06 - 15:10)
them Pokemon sleep is or Pokemon go is (15:07 - 15:12)
the one that makes the most money it's (15:10 - 15:15)
still like top 10 in the App Store um in (15:12 - 15:17)
the Android store Google Play Store (15:15 - 15:21)
sorry like it's very OB like even if you (15:17 - 15:23)
aren't looking at (15:21 - 15:25)
the statistics that like third parties (15:23 - 15:27)
pull on the back end if you just open (15:25 - 15:29)
your phone and look at the top grossing (15:27 - 15:31)
apps like Pokemon go is always in like (15:29 - 15:34)
top 10 and if it's not in the top 10 (15:31 - 15:36)
it's like top 20 and it just it's just a (15:34 - 15:39)
slow week and a soon as they do like I (15:36 - 15:40)
I'm sure it's top 10 because Mewtwo is (15:39 - 15:44)
this weekend and people love Mewtwo um (15:40 - 15:46)
so it's it's like I don't think I've (15:44 - 15:48)
ever seen Pokemon sleep in the top 10 or (15:46 - 15:50)
Pokemon like definitely not Pokemon (15:48 - 15:52)
Masters no well maybe that's why Pokemon (15:50 - 15:54)
go doesn't feel they have to apologize (15:52 - 15:57)
yeah we're so popular yeah they're so (15:54 - 15:59)
popular they don't have to show that (15:57 - 16:01)
little bit of extra respect for the (15:59 - 16:03)
people who use their app MH because (16:01 - 16:05)
that's what it feels like it feels like (16:03 - 16:08)
the other apps respect their users and (16:05 - 16:11)
the difference is that Pokemon go yes it (16:08 - 16:13)
does but not not in the same way and not (16:11 - 16:14)
as (16:13 - 16:17)
much yeah um I will say just kind of (16:14 - 16:19)
going back to the cafe remix uh thing (16:17 - 16:21)
that you said earlier when it comes to (16:19 - 16:24)
the cafe remix like economy and I I (16:21 - 16:27)
haven't played sleep enough to know if (16:24 - 16:28)
it does it in this same way and I (16:27 - 16:29)
haven't played the other games nearly (16:28 - 16:32)
enough either but I will say the thing (16:29 - 16:34)
about Pokemon go that is a little (16:32 - 16:37)
different and I know people are angry (16:34 - 16:39)
about they're like frustrated about how (16:37 - 16:41)
everything is pay right these days so (16:39 - 16:43)
every event has an extra ticket you can (16:41 - 16:46)
buy every event has all this stuff but (16:43 - 16:49)
it's all kept in one place so you (16:46 - 16:51)
actually have to kind of like seek it (16:49 - 16:53)
out to go pay money with Pokemon go (16:51 - 16:55)
whereas something like Pokemon cafe (16:53 - 16:58)
remix it's constantly like shoving those (16:55 - 16:59)
things in your face like you go to do (16:58 - 17:00)
something and it's like oh do you want (16:59 - 17:03)
to spend $9 to get Altaria no okay how (17:00 - 17:06)
about $7 to get Mew how about $6 to get (17:03 - 17:07)
this it's like no I just want to get to (17:06 - 17:09)
the game like I don't want to click (17:07 - 17:12)
through skip skip skip with Pokemon go (17:09 - 17:13)
they at least keep it where it's like if (17:12 - 17:16)
I want to spend money or I go to a (17:13 - 17:18)
specific place in the game it's not (17:16 - 17:20)
constantly popping up with like do you (17:18 - 17:22)
want to buy this ticket right now like (17:20 - 17:24)
it at least always have remote raid (17:22 - 17:26)
passes in your bag or always have raid (17:24 - 17:28)
passes in your bag cuz there there are (17:26 - 17:30)
moments in Pokemon go where if you don't (17:28 - 17:32)
have a raid pass it is do you want to (17:30 - 17:33)
buy a raid (17:32 - 17:37)
pass click on a raid right yeah right so (17:33 - 17:39)
my like I'm saying like right is if (17:37 - 17:41)
you're going to do a raid it's going to (17:39 - 17:42)
ask you if you want to but you have to (17:41 - 17:44)
your your action is like going to do (17:42 - 17:45)
something that you know is going to cost (17:44 - 17:46)
money unless you have a free raid pass (17:45 - 17:48)
with you whereas like with Cafe remix if (17:46 - 17:50)
I'm just going to play the normal game (17:48 - 17:53)
any version of the normal like just go (17:50 - 17:55)
play a puzzle it's like well hold on do (17:53 - 17:56)
you want this and it's like no I don't (17:55 - 17:58)
want to spend any money I just want to (17:56 - 17:59)
play the puzzle (17:58 - 18:02)
and it you know um I would understand (17:59 - 18:05)
that if I was out of whatever their Cafe (18:02 - 18:07)
remix's currency is to play the puzzle (18:05 - 18:09)
right but it's like no I have plenty of (18:07 - 18:11)
that I I just want to go play the puzzle (18:09 - 18:12)
but it's like well how about this (18:11 - 18:14)
costume how about that thing and you (18:12 - 18:17)
want this extra thing it's yeah not a (18:14 - 18:19)
not a fan not a fan of that when Pokemon (18:17 - 18:22)
duel was on its way out oh gosh gosh we (18:19 - 18:23)
haven't talked about Pokemon duel in (18:22 - 18:25)
forever there was a great game by the (18:23 - 18:27)
way I I I installed that was the first (18:25 - 18:28)
time I installed it cuz I was like I (18:27 - 18:31)
need to see these microtransactions cuz (18:28 - 18:33)
it was very obvious that like oh the (18:31 - 18:36)
writing is on the wall here and I can't (18:33 - 18:37)
remember what one of them was it was (18:36 - 18:41)
like $35 for like something $17 a month (18:37 - 18:43)
was the subscription that they had like (18:41 - 18:45)
on their way out the $17 a month (18:43 - 18:47)
subscription yeah there was like a like (18:45 - 18:50)
a $35 welcome packet or something maybe (18:47 - 18:51)
I'm misremembering I swear I'm not (18:50 - 18:53)
though but I remember popping up being (18:51 - 18:55)
like do you want to buy this and I was (18:53 - 18:57)
like whoa whoa whoa whoa I I like I (18:55 - 18:59)
haven't even played the game yet and (18:57 - 19:01)
asking me if I want to like buy this (18:59 - 19:03)
like I just installed it and I'm like (19:01 - 19:04)
I'm trying to navigate through your (19:03 - 19:07)
menus and I said No and then it gave me (19:04 - 19:09)
a popup of like do you want to buy and (19:07 - 19:10)
it was the same thing but like they (19:09 - 19:12)
slashed the price and it was like (19:10 - 19:16)
cheaper yeah yeah I will say Pokemon (19:12 - 19:18)
unite feels like that sometimes Pokemon (19:16 - 19:20)
unite does feel like that sometimes when (19:18 - 19:23)
you're getting started with it um but (19:20 - 19:25)
Cafe remix is probably even more (19:23 - 19:28)
so but going back to anotomy like I do (19:25 - 19:32)
think that Pokemon Masters in a is a (19:28 - 19:33)
pretty good place for its economy I (19:32 - 19:37)
think Pokemon go fun fact today's the (19:33 - 19:40)
oneye anniversary of the increased price (19:37 - 19:43)
of remote raid passes in Pokemon go I do (19:40 - 19:45)
think though overall Pokemon Go's (19:43 - 19:48)
economy is pretty good like there are (19:45 - 19:50)
things that outly like the zero ticket (19:48 - 19:53)
being $8 is like kind of expensive but (19:50 - 19:56)
like um but Steve you get a SE dot out (19:53 - 19:59)
of that I did catch my SE dot thank you (19:56 - 20:02)
very much but like compared to Pokemon (19:59 - 20:04)
sleep it's (20:02 - 20:08)
$5 or not $5 it's $10 it's 500 gems (20:04 - 20:11)
which is $10 for a good camp ticket (20:08 - 20:15)
which is one week so like if you are a (20:11 - 20:17)
good camp ticket every week which some (20:15 - 20:20)
people are and I wish I could be you I (20:17 - 20:22)
ain't got my wallet ain't that deep but (20:20 - 20:25)
you're spending $10 a week on a good (20:22 - 20:28)
camp ticket whereas there's nothing in (20:25 - 20:34)
Pokemon go that is $10 a week I guess (20:28 - 20:36)
unless you're like buying incubators or (20:34 - 20:39)
Raid passes yeah like I mean you can get (20:36 - 20:43)
there you can get there sure but like (20:39 - 20:45)
even even when you want to buy Pokeballs (20:43 - 20:49)
or Great Balls they're super expensive (20:45 - 20:51)
and in Pokemon go you could be like well (20:49 - 20:53)
pokeballs are expensive in Pokemon go (20:51 - 20:55)
too you're right they are and like (20:53 - 20:57)
there's no secret that Niantic (20:55 - 20:59)
artificially boosted the price of Pok (20:57 - 21:01)
ball so you just force you to go out and (20:59 - 21:02)
get them for free like I get that (21:01 - 21:04)
psychology of like oh these are so (21:02 - 21:06)
expensive why would I pay for these when (21:04 - 21:08)
I could just spend 10 minutes and refill (21:06 - 21:11)
um like in eight years or it's going to (21:08 - 21:13)
be eight years of Pokemon go I've never (21:11 - 21:17)
bought a Pokeball ever but also I live (21:13 - 21:19)
in big cities like Milwaukee was like (21:17 - 21:23)
what the 26th biggest city in the US uh (21:19 - 21:24)
Twin Cities is like the 24th biggest (21:23 - 21:28)
city in the US like I can get 400 like I (21:24 - 21:29)
this is not me bragging but I can (21:28 - 21:31)
literally go from zero to 400 pokeballs (21:29 - 21:34)
in less than an hour at Mall of America (21:31 - 21:36)
again very privileged best place indoor (21:34 - 21:39)
place to play like I'm sure if you live (21:36 - 21:41)
in the middle of nowhere you're like I (21:39 - 21:45)
have to buy Pokeballs I get that um but (21:41 - 21:47)
like I I still think that Pokemon (21:45 - 21:51)
sleep's store is so overpriced that the (21:47 - 21:55)
really the only like good value I think (21:51 - 22:01)
is $10 a month uh for the the (21:55 - 22:03)
subscription even that is like when you (22:01 - 22:05)
really think about it it's like that's (22:03 - 22:08)
$10 a month that's still $10 a month (22:05 - 22:10)
like that is still that's still higher (22:08 - 22:14)
than most other sleep apps yeah I mean I (22:10 - 22:16)
guess you know Pokemon go doesn't have (22:14 - 22:19)
any type of subscription I I guess (22:16 - 22:21)
they're they sort of try to do things (22:19 - 22:22)
with these these like they probably (22:21 - 22:24)
would if they could figure out how to (22:22 - 22:27)
program it I think the codee's already (22:24 - 22:31)
in the game seen subscription stuff yeah (22:27 - 22:33)
and I it's not a subscription it (22:31 - 22:35)
definitely like I'm not saying this is a (22:33 - 22:38)
subscription but it's closer to it with (22:35 - 22:40)
like the seasonal tickets that they're (22:38 - 22:42)
doing with like pay $5 a month (22:40 - 22:43)
throughout the season and you're going (22:42 - 22:45)
to get this kind of stuff you know like (22:43 - 22:47)
I feel like it's almost like they are (22:45 - 22:50)
like slowly stepping into what could be (22:47 - 22:52)
a subscription and seeing if like they (22:50 - 22:55)
do get people to purchase these things (22:52 - 23:00)
along the way uh but you know $10 a (22:55 - 23:04)
month to have extra things in a sleep (23:00 - 23:07)
tracking app you know is not actually (23:04 - 23:09)
abnormal to have a sleep tracking you (23:07 - 23:11)
technically it's a game that encourages (23:09 - 23:14)
good behavior Bobby don't don't call it (23:11 - 23:17)
a sleep tracking app sure okay great (23:14 - 23:20)
well that costing $10 a month you know (23:17 - 23:22)
that is that's that's expensive like (23:20 - 23:24)
that is expensive when it you think (23:22 - 23:27)
about other games where now to be fair (23:24 - 23:29)
you can obviously not pay $10 a month (23:27 - 23:31)
and still play the game just fine um (23:29 - 23:35)
yeah but like I guess just just like I (23:31 - 23:37)
feel like (23:35 - 23:39)
they're I don't know I don't know why I (23:37 - 23:41)
feel like they're like they could have a (23:39 - 23:43)
tier with like $5 a month or something (23:41 - 23:44)
like I just feel like $10 a month is a (23:43 - 23:46)
big jump from nothing like nothing or (23:44 - 23:50)
$10 a month seems like a big jump for um (23:46 - 23:52)
a Pokemon mobile game just because I (23:50 - 23:53)
don't I feel like I haven't seen (23:52 - 23:55)
something quite like that before but (23:53 - 23:57)
again like I don't play all the like all (23:55 - 23:59)
the different Pokemon mobile games and (23:57 - 24:01)
Pokemon smile does not have a (23:59 - 24:03)
subscription so I wouldn't know (24:01 - 24:05)
otherwise Pokemon Masters has a (24:03 - 24:09)
subscription and it's kind of bad um is (24:05 - 24:10)
it (24:09 - 24:12)
expensive it's not like terribly (24:10 - 24:14)
expensive but it requires you to log in (24:12 - 24:15)
in order to collect it it's like it's (24:14 - 24:18)
like a Pokemon unite thing like Pokemon (24:15 - 24:20)
unite is also similar where it's like (24:18 - 24:23)
you need to log in to collect your like (24:20 - 24:25)
your gems and stuff I've always felt (24:23 - 24:27)
weird about when you pay for something (24:25 - 24:29)
and then but you still have to like (24:27 - 24:30)
especially with Pokemon Pokemon go does (24:29 - 24:34)
this the worst like so you pay for uh a (24:30 - 24:35)
research or something but if you don't (24:34 - 24:38)
open the app in the time that then it (24:35 - 24:39)
just goes away like you just can't get (24:38 - 24:43)
it like it's very weird to me that that (24:39 - 24:46)
happens like how will paid for (24:43 - 24:50)
the go ticket and didn't open his app on (24:46 - 24:52)
the day for Victini so just I do Wonder (24:50 - 24:54)
looking back like how much money have (24:52 - 24:56)
they made on people who paid for a (24:54 - 24:59)
research ticket and then did didn't open (24:56 - 25:03)
the app in time for it to to pop up and (24:59 - 25:05)
it doesn't happen with every research (25:03 - 25:07)
obviously but there have been I know (25:05 - 25:08)
there have been some in the past where (25:07 - 25:10)
it does (25:08 - 25:12)
and it seems especially when you buy it (25:10 - 25:14)
beforehand so it's like you bought it (25:12 - 25:16)
before the event but now you have to (25:14 - 25:18)
remember to open it during the event or (25:16 - 25:21)
else you just spent you know five bucks (25:18 - 25:23)
or 10 bucks to get nothing which is just (25:21 - 25:25)
like buying incubators (25:23 - 25:27)
anyway yeah (25:25 - 25:29)
I (25:27 - 25:30)
like I I don't think Pokemon sleep is (25:29 - 25:32)
perfect I think they're very good at (25:30 - 25:34)
apologizing and making up for stuff I (25:32 - 25:37)
think their economy is not great whereas (25:34 - 25:39)
like Pokemon (25:37 - 25:43)
go you can do so much for free and (25:39 - 25:45)
they're like like their economy is (25:43 - 25:47)
pretty like low level of like I just (25:45 - 25:49)
want to buy one raid pass or I just want (25:47 - 25:50)
to buy one incubator and it doesn't feel (25:49 - 25:52)
like you're breaking the bank or like (25:50 - 25:53)
Pokemon sleep you can't even buy (25:52 - 25:55)
anything like oh I just want to spend (25:53 - 25:56)
like $2 like what are you going to get (25:55 - 25:59)
for $2 like a whistle (25:56 - 26:01)
I don't even think the whistle is as (25:59 - 26:02)
much as that yeah yeah the whistle is (26:01 - 26:03)
like (26:02 - 26:06)
$4 yeah that's and they gave three (26:03 - 26:08)
whistles as well as an apology that was (26:06 - 26:11)
also part of theiry that was cool yeah (26:08 - 26:14)
um but yeah whistles are like (26:11 - 26:16)
it's maybe the rewards in Pokemon sleep (26:14 - 26:19)
feel so good because like everything in (26:16 - 26:22)
their store feels so expensive that's (26:19 - 26:24)
what it is that's price things higher to (26:22 - 26:26)
make things feel to make it feel better (26:24 - 26:29)
the only things that you can get for $2 (26:26 - 26:31)
are the upgrades to the bag the (26:29 - 26:34)
ingredients pocket so the Pokemon box (26:31 - 26:35)
the ingredients pocket and the items (26:34 - 26:38)
pocket so the upad that's the only thing (26:35 - 26:39)
those are the cheapest things the same (26:38 - 26:42)
thing from Pokemon go because it's $2 to (26:39 - 26:44)
upgrade your bag or your Pokemon storage (26:42 - 26:46)
in Pokemon go as well right yeah (26:44 - 26:49)
yep oh wait the energy pillow the energy (26:46 - 26:52)
pillow is L that that is like buying a (26:49 - 26:56)
that's like buying revives in Pokemon (26:52 - 26:58)
sleeve when you're someone who doesn't (26:56 - 27:00)
get enough (26:58 - 27:04)
sleep uh yep me me too sometimes you (27:00 - 27:06)
could do you can get a Pokemon with (27:04 - 27:10)
energy bonus or what that gold skill (27:06 - 27:13)
energy that works it does work it does (27:10 - 27:15)
but also sometimes you need to swap back (27:13 - 27:17)
in a Pokemon to your team that doesn't (27:15 - 27:20)
have its energy at full there are a few (27:17 - 27:22)
different situations I feel like I'm (27:20 - 27:23)
very blessed to have a super good (27:22 - 27:25)
Wigglytuff so my like energy never drops (27:23 - 27:28)
below like 80% cuz that Wigglytuff (27:25 - 27:32)
always popping off Queen I don't know if (27:28 - 27:34)
my energy ever hit (27:32 - 27:36)
80% yeah the I think uh I don't know how (27:34 - 27:39)
the game calculates energy but I feel (27:36 - 27:40)
like the (27:39 - 27:42)
higher like I feel like I never drop (27:40 - 27:44)
below 80% on green grass but if I go to (27:42 - 27:48)
lapis it feels like it takes more energy (27:44 - 27:51)
I think something with like how I could (27:48 - 27:52)
be completely wrong but it feels like (27:51 - 27:54)
the higher rank you go up the more (27:52 - 27:56)
energy it's like consuming I mean it's (27:54 - 27:58)
also harder to like fill the gauge the (27:56 - 28:01)
higher you go up too so what's the like (27:58 - 28:03)
what is the energy you have a wiggly tff (28:01 - 28:05)
you said that's really good so you it (28:03 - 28:08)
gives you energy yeah uh Wiggly tffs (28:05 - 28:09)
there's like three Pokemon that give (28:08 - 28:12)
it's called energy for everyone so (28:09 - 28:15)
you'll see on like the subred like e e I (28:12 - 28:17)
have an iggly buff that has energy for (28:15 - 28:20)
everyone s at level one yeah yep so it's (28:17 - 28:22)
it's Wiggly it's the wiggly tough line (28:20 - 28:24)
the r line and then Espeon I think are (28:22 - 28:27)
the three that can do that um when I say (28:24 - 28:29)
RS line I mean G of War Gade as actually (28:27 - 28:31)
something (28:29 - 28:35)
different but um it's a skill Pokemon so (28:31 - 28:38)
if your Igglybuff has like skill Trigger (28:35 - 28:40)
or main skill up as a nature that's (28:38 - 28:41)
really good because that pairs with it (28:40 - 28:44)
but ultimately it gives energy to (28:41 - 28:47)
everyone on your team uh when it pops (28:44 - 28:50)
whereas some Pokemon like Leafeon is (28:47 - 28:52)
like it'll give energy to a random (28:50 - 28:54)
Pokemon which isn't particularly good (28:52 - 28:55)
and then there's like a poke there's (28:54 - 28:57)
like ekins which gives energy to itself (28:55 - 28:59)
which is like okay (28:57 - 29:02)
um selfish selfish but like if it's a (28:59 - 29:04)
Pokemon that's like Gathering berries (29:02 - 29:06)
over and over like giving energy back to (29:04 - 29:08)
yourself is pretty good so you can keep (29:06 - 29:10)
that up I think there's like a hidden (29:08 - 29:12)
mechanic in Pokemon sleep where like (29:10 - 29:15)
your Pokemon I could be I again I could (29:12 - 29:15)
be wrong I have to look this up I don't (29:15 - 29:17)
have numbers in front of me because like (29:15 - 29:19)
everything in Pokemon sleep is hidden (29:17 - 29:20)
like they have so many like hidden (29:19 - 29:23)
calculations and stuff but I think that (29:20 - 29:26)
if your Pokemon is over 80% energy it (29:23 - 29:30)
will work 20% harder and then when it (29:26 - 29:34)
hits at 80 and Below or I guess 79 and (29:30 - 29:36)
below it like significantly slows down (29:34 - 29:38)
because you don't get that like boost (29:36 - 29:40)
that 20% boost so by keeping your (29:38 - 29:44)
Pokemon always above 80% they're working (29:40 - 29:45)
way more (29:44 - 29:47)
efficiently so and that's why like (29:45 - 29:50)
people put Wiggly tough or Espeon on (29:47 - 29:52)
their team no matter what berries there (29:50 - 29:55)
are because it's it the payoff is so (29:52 - 29:58)
great so my iggly buff has the energy (29:55 - 30:01)
for everyone El but the it's energy (29:58 - 30:04)
recovery is down is that oh that's fine (30:01 - 30:06)
that's fine it doesn't okay yeah what (30:04 - 30:11)
what is it main scale up no it's um I (30:06 - 30:13)
just closed the app it's (30:11 - 30:15)
uh I have another complaint about this (30:13 - 30:16)
app in a (30:15 - 30:20)
second it's uh speed of help up uh oh (30:16 - 30:22)
that's that's (30:20 - 30:25)
okay do does any of the like do you have (30:22 - 30:29)
main skill trigger on the 1025 (30:25 - 30:33)
in the sub skills sub skills uh I have (30:29 - 30:35)
what is it called main skill yeah main (30:33 - 30:37)
skill trigger smaller medium just skill (30:35 - 30:40)
trigger I have skill level up S for (30:37 - 30:45)
level 10 that's okay that's not bad yeah (30:40 - 30:46)
yeah skill trigger skill trigger is a (30:45 - 30:48)
good one yeah I don't have skill trigger (30:46 - 30:51)
on that but throw it away it's not (30:48 - 30:56)
good so one thing I don't this is a (30:51 - 30:58)
common thing with a lot of Pokemon (30:56 - 30:59)
mobile games I feel like other than (30:58 - 31:04)
Pokémon go is uh how often going from (30:59 - 31:06)
one place to another place in the app (31:04 - 31:09)
needs loading so like you click on (31:06 - 31:11)
something and then it's like now loading (31:09 - 31:12)
and then it gets to that and then you (31:11 - 31:14)
click on the next thing now loading and (31:12 - 31:15)
so when you're trying to move around the (31:14 - 31:17)
app quite a bit there's a lot of like (31:15 - 31:19)
click loading click loading and I feel (31:17 - 31:21)
like the same with that's the same with (31:19 - 31:23)
home that's the same with remix that's (31:21 - 31:25)
was the same with duel that's the same (31:23 - 31:27)
with even Pokemon smile like all these (31:25 - 31:29)
apps like have and and maybe it's a (31:27 - 31:30)
bigger thing with apps but then with (31:29 - 31:33)
Pokémon go you just go do things and it (31:30 - 31:36)
just Pokémon go is super fast quickly (31:33 - 31:38)
works like just go from place to place (31:36 - 31:41)
whereas with like a lot over atantic (31:38 - 31:43)
yeah a lot of these other games it's (31:41 - 31:45)
just a lot of there's a lot of loading (31:43 - 31:49)
screens to go from one thing Masters is (31:45 - 31:52)
pretty fast relative to the rest of them (31:49 - 31:53)
but yeah that's the whole reason I don't (31:52 - 31:55)
transfer Pokemon in Pokemon sleep (31:53 - 31:56)
because I never want to go through all (31:55 - 31:59)
of those loading screens (31:56 - 32:00)
yeah it's that's the same thing with (31:59 - 32:03)
like Pokemon home is there's a lot of (32:00 - 32:04)
just trying to go from one place to the (32:03 - 32:06)
other it's like okay here and then and (32:04 - 32:07)
you go to the wrong place and I'm like (32:06 - 32:08)
no no no I have to go back oh no now (32:07 - 32:11)
it's loading again go back over here it (32:08 - 32:13)
just uh I just feel like it takes a lot (32:11 - 32:16)
longer they did speed up the cooking at (32:13 - 32:19)
one point the cooking was like three (32:16 - 32:21)
times slower and they like sped up the (32:19 - 32:24)
fan yeah the when you like fan the the (32:21 - 32:26)
the fire it used to be super slow and (32:24 - 32:28)
they that was like a one point two (32:26 - 32:30)
update or something like they're like we (32:28 - 32:31)
made it (32:30 - 32:34)
faster wow yeah you know but that's not (32:31 - 32:36)
the loading screens not the loading (32:34 - 32:39)
screens but um that's okay I still like (32:36 - 32:42)
the app it's good it's fun how do we go (32:39 - 32:44)
30 minutes without talking about riko (32:42 - 32:46)
[Laughter] (32:44 - 32:49)
uh I I got my (32:46 - 32:53)
riko I used two ense the first one I (32:49 - 32:55)
used three biscuits the second one I (32:53 - 32:58)
used two biscuits I didn't get raicho (32:55 - 33:01)
hungry unfortunately would been nice if (32:58 - 33:03)
he was hungry (33:01 - 33:08)
um I'm like ready to get a second one uh (33:03 - 33:10)
but I I guess I'm like (33:08 - 33:12)
waiting cuz I I was waiting to get to (33:10 - 33:15)
master rank 19 if possible to try to get (33:12 - 33:18)
that sleep style because (33:15 - 33:21)
like I'm thinking in the (33:18 - 33:23)
future (33:21 - 33:26)
if I get to master rank 19 there's still (33:23 - 33:29)
like a very rare chance he spawns to I (33:26 - 33:31)
can't even get Den to spawn and den is (33:29 - 33:34)
not even a legendary Pokemon I've been (33:31 - 33:36)
I've been like Master ranked two since (33:34 - 33:38)
day one like I got the master rank (33:36 - 33:41)
really quick I'm like almost this (33:38 - 33:43)
morning I caught my second to wow was it (33:41 - 33:46)
good no but my first one was good so (33:43 - 33:50)
that's fine that's fine then that's (33:46 - 33:55)
okay so like I'm not in a rush to use (33:50 - 33:57)
that also raicho is just not good it's (33:55 - 34:01)
like not particularly like helpful but (33:57 - 34:03)
it's raicho and that's all that matters (34:01 - 34:05)
the the problem with like electric (34:03 - 34:07)
Pokemon right now is there's no electric (34:05 - 34:09)
Pokemon that gather (34:07 - 34:12)
ingredients so you need like a Blastoise (34:09 - 34:14)
or a Venusaur or a Gengar on your team (34:12 - 34:16)
to get ingredients and as soon as you (34:14 - 34:19)
start replacing electric Pokemon raicho (34:16 - 34:22)
becomes more and more useless and it's (34:19 - 34:24)
not even like the free raicho that bad (34:22 - 34:27)
it's like there it could be way worse is (34:24 - 34:29)
what I would say there there are way (34:27 - 34:32)
worse Ros out there so like I do think (34:29 - 34:34)
it's like nice that they gave like a (34:32 - 34:37)
pretty okay REO but like I've seen so (34:34 - 34:39)
many people post their second raicho and (34:37 - 34:40)
they're like oh this is like (34:39 - 34:42)
significantly (34:40 - 34:47)
worse completely unusable yeah so like I (34:42 - 34:49)
don't know like I I told everyone last (34:47 - 34:51)
week not to use their master ball makes (34:49 - 34:52)
sense for Bobby though (34:51 - 34:55)
since like I mean I don't know I am (34:52 - 34:56)
really curious if you could have gotten (34:55 - 34:59)
it without the master ball yeah I can (34:56 - 35:00)
I'll get into I can get into it when I (34:59 - 35:03)
talk about myo if you want to finish go (35:00 - 35:06)
ahead go ahead thing okay so I got my (35:03 - 35:09)
first raicho so once we got the free (35:06 - 35:13)
incense and the free biscuit I went in (35:09 - 35:15)
and I bought a master biscuit with a (35:13 - 35:18)
points or whatever for um you know the (35:15 - 35:21)
4,000 points or whatever and then um (35:18 - 35:23)
used the incense and got raicho just (35:21 - 35:26)
used the master biscuit and then so I (35:23 - 35:28)
haven't used any raicho Main or anything (35:26 - 35:30)
like that or I hadn't I hadn't used any (35:28 - 35:34)
so then last night I bought a raicho (35:30 - 35:37)
incense to get a second one today and (35:34 - 35:41)
then I used my two free biscuits or my (35:37 - 35:43)
two raicho biscuits so I it's not I (35:41 - 35:45)
haven't caught it or anything yet but (35:43 - 35:47)
like I am on my second one now so I I (35:45 - 35:49)
definitely could have gotten it without (35:47 - 35:51)
the master biscuit because at this point (35:49 - 35:53)
I still (35:51 - 35:57)
have 300 raicho Main and I haven't done (35:53 - 35:59)
any I haven't put any diamonds into like (35:57 - 36:00)
the bundle or anything like I just (35:59 - 36:04)
that's just from and I don't and I was (36:00 - 36:06)
um to the the whole thing with like (36:04 - 36:09)
getting Reich comain from your friends I (36:06 - 36:11)
haven't been (36:09 - 36:13)
because actually I've gotten one and it (36:11 - 36:15)
was from Steve and it was the other day (36:13 - 36:16)
that was it I've gotten that was it but (36:15 - 36:19)
like I have like 20 some odd friends and (36:16 - 36:21)
I haven't gotten any raich comain except (36:19 - 36:25)
for the one so that's all just been from (36:21 - 36:27)
what I collected in the you know waking (36:25 - 36:30)
up and then I think did they give us (36:27 - 36:33)
raicho main at some no maybe they didn't (36:30 - 36:34)
give us any Romain but you bought one of (36:33 - 36:38)
the boxes with gems right well I didn't (36:34 - 36:40)
but I haven't done I haven't bought any (36:38 - 36:41)
of those or I haven't done any of the (36:40 - 36:42)
bundles or anything like that I thought (36:41 - 36:44)
you I haven't done any bundles either (36:42 - 36:47)
yeah so just from waking up collecting (36:44 - 36:49)
it with the research and then the (36:47 - 36:52)
missions just completing the missions (36:49 - 36:58)
yeah to like 350 or so raicho main so (36:52 - 36:59)
and was still a week to go with there (36:58 - 37:01)
was still like eight days to go with (36:59 - 37:04)
this event so yeah I would have no (37:01 - 37:05)
problem (37:04 - 37:07)
catching one possibly two without (37:05 - 37:10)
actually using a master biscuit so but I (37:07 - 37:12)
mean I just wanted to just get the first (37:10 - 37:14)
one caught just to which I think a lot (37:12 - 37:15)
of people did right that a lot of people (37:14 - 37:17)
wanted to get that first one caught but (37:15 - 37:19)
uh see that's why I wasn't in a rush cuz (37:17 - 37:22)
I was like it's so it I I caught it and (37:19 - 37:23)
then I still didn't put in my team cuz (37:22 - 37:25)
the Pokemon I have on my team are just (37:23 - 37:28)
so much better well okay so but for you (37:25 - 37:30)
it makes sense cuz you've just literally (37:28 - 37:32)
started playing if I'm being completely (37:30 - 37:35)
honest you have that moment of like oh (37:32 - 37:36)
it can be (37:35 - 37:38)
shiny and then you know it's like well (37:36 - 37:40)
let me get one to spawn oh it's not (37:38 - 37:42)
shiny all right well let me catch this (37:40 - 37:45)
and then uh let me see if you know I can (37:42 - 37:46)
get another one to be shiny or something (37:45 - 37:48)
so there's that yeah well fun fact if (37:46 - 37:50)
you gave it like a (37:48 - 37:52)
biscuit like and it comes back it can (37:50 - 37:54)
come back shiny like they are they they (37:52 - 37:57)
do roll every time even if you like fed (37:54 - 37:59)
them yeah I figured that but once I had (37:57 - 38:00)
it in front of me I was like well now I (37:59 - 38:01)
just want to catch it now I just want to (38:00 - 38:04)
get this first one out of the way so and (38:01 - 38:06)
I I thought it was (38:04 - 38:08)
cool because I was already going to get (38:06 - 38:09)
the master biscuit anyway like I had (38:08 - 38:12)
already kind of planned to do that like (38:09 - 38:13)
I thought I was like oh I'll just do (38:12 - 38:16)
this and then I still have I still had (38:13 - 38:18)
like the raicho biscuits and everything (38:16 - 38:19)
so I could like for a second one if I (38:18 - 38:22)
wanted to do that but um like to your (38:19 - 38:25)
point a lot of people I've seen have (38:22 - 38:27)
been like oh the second one's terrible (38:25 - 38:28)
so (38:27 - 38:31)
so that's why I like even if there was (38:28 - 38:32)
an electric (38:31 - 38:36)
Island it's like until they release an (38:32 - 38:38)
electric ingredient finder it's like (38:36 - 38:40)
really hard to (38:38 - 38:43)
justify raicho as a Pokemon right now (38:40 - 38:46)
even if you got like God roll raicho (38:43 - 38:46)
it's (38:46 - 38:49)
like you you got to live off apples or (38:46 - 38:51)
something cuz like all cuz like that's (38:49 - 38:53)
all electric Pokemon are bringing in how (38:51 - 38:55)
was your experience (38:53 - 38:59)
Hannah um I got my so my first Raichu (38:55 - 39:01)
was hungry so it only took two times (38:59 - 39:05)
seeing it and only took three biscuits I (39:01 - 39:06)
think then that makes sense yeah three (39:05 - 39:09)
Raichu biscuits to get it I got the (39:06 - 39:10)
standard one that everyone has and I (39:09 - 39:12)
haven't worked super hard at getting (39:10 - 39:14)
another one because I think you were (39:12 - 39:16)
saying Steve that you were going to go (39:14 - 39:19)
for the main skill seed before getting (39:16 - 39:21)
SE is way better than a second one yeah (39:19 - 39:22)
I think that's what I'm going to be (39:21 - 39:23)
doing too I don't quite have enough (39:22 - 39:26)
Raichu man for the seed but I will soon (39:23 - 39:28)
and I plan to get that before even (39:26 - 39:32)
trying for another Raichu yeah I thought (39:28 - 39:35)
like do I spend (39:32 - 39:38)
80 was it 80 for an incense and force it (39:35 - 39:40)
in or now that I've been I've been (39:38 - 39:46)
Master ranked n since Tuesday so it's (39:40 - 39:48)
like what if it just spawned in then I'm (39:46 - 39:51)
saving 80 Maine and like I'm I have (39:48 - 39:54)
biscuits just in case but like I don't (39:51 - 39:56)
need it so I would rather get the main (39:54 - 39:58)
skill seed I know for for sure once I (39:56 - 40:00)
get the main skill seed I'll still have (39:58 - 40:02)
left over to spawn another raicho in (40:00 - 40:05)
before the event is over so at this (40:02 - 40:07)
point it's just like I'm saving money if (40:05 - 40:10)
he just randomly appears oh totally is (40:07 - 40:13)
there by the way is there a minimum to (40:10 - 40:15)
how many biscuits can make a Pokemon (40:13 - 40:18)
full because the raicho that I had that (40:15 - 40:21)
that I saw this morning uh it got full (40:18 - 40:24)
after the after just the two REO two I (40:21 - 40:26)
think is the minimum I've never seen a (40:24 - 40:29)
Pokemon get full on one one biscuit yeah (40:26 - 40:31)
never gotten a critical hit on (40:29 - 40:35)
one no sorry like no like get full so I (40:31 - 40:38)
can't I can't go any further with it so (40:35 - 40:42)
yeah I only got we keep messing that (40:38 - 40:45)
up like not full bar but the Pokemon is (40:42 - 40:48)
like I can't accept any more biscuits (40:45 - 40:51)
yeah so I was able to use the two raicho (40:48 - 40:55)
biscuits so I got 12 out of the 30 bars (40:51 - 40:57)
and then it said it was full I couldn't (40:55 - 40:58)
give it any more biscuit gets after that (40:57 - 41:01)
so uh I just I hadn't seen it I hadn't (40:58 - 41:04)
seen one that got full in two where I (41:01 - 41:06)
couldn't give it (41:04 - 41:09)
anymore yeah two is definitely possible (41:06 - 41:14)
one I think no wait is two possible yeah (41:09 - 41:16)
once you feed it two times then it can (41:14 - 41:19)
get full that absolutely can happen yeah (41:16 - 41:21)
yes but you can always feed it more than (41:19 - 41:23)
once (41:21 - 41:25)
yes it's like two to question mark (41:23 - 41:26)
question (41:25 - 41:28)
mark (41:26 - 41:30)
I gave raicho three biscuits and then he (41:28 - 41:33)
was full and I was like ah that sucks (41:30 - 41:36)
like whatever I I'll get him tomorrow (41:33 - 41:38)
and then I went to give like a swablu (41:36 - 41:40)
who's like four out of five like one (41:38 - 41:42)
biscuit like one Pokeball and it (41:40 - 41:45)
critical hited that one and I was like (41:42 - 41:48)
no I was like this is what I don't need (41:45 - 41:51)
to crit you were already going to be Max (41:48 - 41:52)
H (41:51 - 41:56)
whatever is okay I don't know if anybody (41:52 - 41:58)
has been able to figure this out how (41:56 - 41:59)
long's this game been out probably like (41:58 - 42:02)
N9 months now it was like July of 2023 (41:59 - 42:04)
when it came out I think eight months (42:02 - 42:08)
eight or nine months yeah okay uh is the (42:04 - 42:10)
critical (42:08 - 42:13)
catch based is it predetermined when the (42:10 - 42:15)
Pokemon spawn in the morning or is it is (42:13 - 42:18)
it like randomized every time you feed (42:15 - 42:20)
something so had you not fed had you (42:18 - 42:22)
been able to feed the REO one more time (42:20 - 42:23)
would that have been the critical catch (42:22 - 42:25)
or was it going to be predetermined to (42:23 - 42:28)
be the swbl from the beginning (42:25 - 42:31)
what I have no clue how that calculates (42:28 - 42:34)
yeah I don't think we we we know that (42:31 - 42:36)
but I'm pretty sure I've seen people (42:34 - 42:39)
saying that it rolls a chance on every (42:36 - 42:41)
time you feed a Pokemon a (42:39 - 42:43)
biscuit that's how I would assume it (42:41 - 42:46)
would work okay you know how critical (42:43 - 42:49)
hit works when cooking (42:46 - 42:52)
right wait you can cooking yeah yeah cuz (42:49 - 42:54)
you commented on my Instagram post cuz (42:52 - 42:57)
my like cooking meal was like 52,000 or (42:54 - 42:59)
whatever yeah that was wild I was like (42:57 - 43:02)
what is happening that's cuz I that's (42:59 - 43:04)
cuz I critical hit that so Monday (43:02 - 43:06)
through Saturday all your meals have a (43:04 - 43:10)
10% chance to critical hit and then on (43:06 - 43:12)
Sunday you'll see it says it'll say plus (43:10 - 43:15)
20 in the upper right hand corner okay (43:12 - 43:17)
uh Sunday your meals have a 30% chance (43:15 - 43:19)
to crit so it's saying plus 20 to a (43:17 - 43:25)
hidden 10% chance and then Den which (43:19 - 43:27)
I've been using which Den is so busted (43:25 - 43:30)
good uh Den every time every time his (43:27 - 43:34)
skill procs it adds plus four and that's (43:30 - 43:36)
like Bas level Den like if you got a (43:34 - 43:38)
stronger Den it would be like plus seven (43:36 - 43:42)
plus n or whatever um so Den will stack (43:38 - 43:45)
so if you if if you did like three Den (43:42 - 43:48)
procs that's plus 12 and it will stay (43:45 - 43:51)
plus 12 until you eventually crit and (43:48 - 43:53)
then it will go back down to zero and (43:51 - 43:57)
reset there's every time I think this is (43:53 - 43:59)
so good handle on this game I learned (43:57 - 44:01)
like a whole there's a whole new thing (43:59 - 44:04)
to like it's just one specific Pokemon (44:01 - 44:06)
that just has this thing that others (44:04 - 44:09)
don't and like that's see that's (44:06 - 44:11)
actually what's like keeping me it's one (44:09 - 44:13)
of the things I find fun is like they're (44:11 - 44:14)
finding out that there's like so much (44:13 - 44:17)
more depth to it than just like oh I (44:14 - 44:19)
sleep I wake up I catch a Pokemon maybe (44:17 - 44:21)
it's shiny maybe it's not like I I (44:19 - 44:23)
really like how much more there is to (44:21 - 44:25)
this that I just kind of disregarded for (44:23 - 44:27)
a long time because again I had a (44:25 - 44:28)
terrible first experience with the game (44:27 - 44:31)
so uh glad I'm I'm glad I've been drawn (44:28 - 44:34)
back in yeah no Pokemon sleep is so good (44:31 - 44:37)
it's such a good (44:34 - 44:37)
game yeah I I think if anyone's (44:38 - 44:42)
listening (44:40 - 44:44)
um if you Ed the master ball on your (44:42 - 44:47)
raicho you should have no problem to get (44:44 - 44:49)
a second one right like cuz you should (44:47 - 44:53)
have so many biscuits or main saved up (44:49 - 44:54)
but I do think like you should (44:53 - 44:56)
prioritize the main skill seed (44:54 - 44:57)
especially if you're a free-to-play (44:56 - 44:59)
player those are even even for a premium (44:57 - 45:01)
player you can only get one a month as a (44:59 - 45:05)
premium player um so I think you should (45:01 - 45:08)
prioritize that for sure also I don't (45:05 - 45:10)
know if this is true I guess we'll find (45:08 - 45:13)
out on Monday when this podcast goes up (45:10 - 45:15)
that people are saying that everyone is (45:13 - 45:17)
going to start at mass at Ultra rank (45:15 - 45:19)
four in Pokemon sleep on Monday like (45:17 - 45:21)
because it's not actually going to reset (45:19 - 45:24)
back to zero and that was why we were (45:21 - 45:26)
getting that error last Sunday is cuz (45:24 - 45:29)
they were pre for (45:26 - 45:32)
that that would very interesting even if (45:29 - 45:35)
you're not at all wait why like what if (45:32 - 45:37)
you're not at Ultra 4 I think then you (45:35 - 45:40)
are at whatever rank you're at so like (45:37 - 45:42)
if you're at like great three you're (45:40 - 45:43)
going to stay at Great three but if (45:42 - 45:45)
you're above Ultra rank four it's going (45:43 - 45:47)
to bring you down to ultra rank four to (45:45 - 45:48)
start the (45:47 - 45:50)
week have we missed that in one of the (45:48 - 45:52)
announcements or was no nothing has been (45:50 - 45:54)
talked about for this it's just like (45:52 - 45:57)
people people were like (45:54 - 46:00)
people speculated it last week when the (45:57 - 46:03)
issue happened that it's the your your (46:00 - 46:05)
stats are not going to reset this week (46:03 - 46:07)
and then as of like last night people (46:05 - 46:09)
were like okay it looks like everyone is (46:07 - 46:11)
going to get pushed back to alra rank (46:09 - 46:13)
four to start this week that was like (46:11 - 46:15)
because in one of the press releases (46:13 - 46:16)
they were like we'll have some special (46:15 - 46:18)
stuff for week two that we're not (46:16 - 46:20)
talking about yet right because they (46:18 - 46:22)
were saying like it was going to they (46:20 - 46:24)
were going to have things that would (46:22 - 46:26)
make it even a little bit easier (46:24 - 46:29)
potentially I think it wasn't worded (46:26 - 46:30)
that way but it seemed like there was (46:29 - 46:32)
going to be it was going to make it even (46:30 - 46:35)
a little bit easier to like get aicho if (46:32 - 46:37)
you don't get one in week one I think it (46:35 - 46:39)
might have been was it something (46:37 - 46:41)
like it was the worded with some like (46:39 - 46:43)
phrase like the last ditch effort or (46:41 - 46:47)
last something like MH it worded in some (46:43 - 46:49)
way that kind of made it seem like oh if (46:47 - 46:50)
you don't get one week one there's like (46:49 - 46:53)
a good chance that there'll be more (46:50 - 46:56)
opportunity in week two to yeah no I I (46:53 - 46:57)
like this is why I was like don't use (46:56 - 46:59)
your master ball cuz I feel like they (46:57 - 47:00)
were doing everything well again for (46:59 - 47:02)
Bobby it makes sense cuz you literally (47:00 - 47:05)
started playing a day before this event (47:02 - 47:07)
started but like if you were playing for (47:05 - 47:08)
six months that's why I was like don't (47:07 - 47:09)
use your master ball because I don't (47:08 - 47:11)
know if they're going to do this for (47:09 - 47:13)
future Legends like I think they're (47:11 - 47:15)
doing this because it is the first (47:13 - 47:17)
Legend and because it worked it got (47:15 - 47:19)
Bobby to download the game and to play (47:17 - 47:22)
it like it like a legendary Pokemon (47:19 - 47:24)
definitely is good enough to bring new (47:22 - 47:28)
people to the game I just don't imagine (47:24 - 47:31)
every Legend is going to be this (47:28 - 47:33)
easy well they brought the right (47:31 - 47:35)
legendary at least in my case to the (47:33 - 47:37)
game like if it had been like re ice or (47:35 - 47:40)
Heatran which I have deep deep (47:37 - 47:42)
bitterness for both of those Pokemon (47:40 - 47:44)
I've I don't know if it would have (47:42 - 47:45)
brought me back in the same way that (47:44 - 47:48)
Reiko (47:45 - 47:49)
did (47:48 - 47:52)
yeah what okay (47:49 - 47:55)
so other than Den like what what are (47:52 - 47:57)
what are people typically using m Master (47:55 - 47:59)
biscuits on though that isn't like I (47:57 - 48:01)
guess cuz there hasn't been a legendary (47:59 - 48:04)
until now but um you know what's another (48:01 - 48:07)
thing I mean AB Kangaskhan Dragonite (48:04 - 48:10)
stuff like that Deli bird the things (48:07 - 48:13)
that have more bars and don't have (48:10 - 48:15)
anything that can evolve into of (48:13 - 48:20)
them oh okay so like one Pokemon line (48:15 - 48:23)
type like Pokemon yeah yeah there's also (48:20 - 48:26)
there like there's the Heracross there's (48:23 - 48:28)
debate whether people even you would (48:26 - 48:30)
want to use a master ball on like a a (48:28 - 48:33)
den or a Heracross or whatever or an (48:30 - 48:35)
Absol (48:33 - 48:37)
but (48:35 - 48:43)
pointwise uh Tyranitar and Dragonite (48:37 - 48:47)
have the most points in the game to fill (48:43 - 48:49)
that isn't raicho like raicho was the (48:47 - 48:53)
first Pokemon to pass that so like if (48:49 - 48:54)
you're just talking about what is the (48:53 - 48:56)
hardest Pokemon to fill that isn't a (48:54 - 48:58)
legendary it's Dragonite and Tyranitar (48:56 - 49:00)
they're on their own I think they're 25 (48:58 - 49:02)
to fill (49:00 - 49:07)
whereas Den is (49:02 - 49:10)
20 something oh den den still that high (49:07 - 49:12)
20 something Den is the same as Absolut (49:10 - 49:15)
the same as Kangas Kangaskhan same as (49:12 - 49:17)
these are just very rare to even spawn (49:15 - 49:19)
in the first place I would imagine right (49:17 - 49:21)
that was kind of the the idea I mean I (49:19 - 49:23)
haven't I haven't seen a Pokemon other (49:21 - 49:25)
than raicho granted I've been playing (49:23 - 49:26)
for two weeks but I haven't seen a (49:25 - 49:29)
Pokemon other than IO um with anything (49:26 - 49:32)
nearly that high I think I saw a doo the (49:29 - 49:33)
other day and it was (49:32 - 49:35)
like and that's not even worth catching (49:33 - 49:37)
that's the thing about (49:35 - 49:41)
drio like a drio a Haunter uh an ivys (49:37 - 49:43)
store like those things aren't even (49:41 - 49:45)
worth catching right because you want to (49:43 - 49:49)
catch the base one to evolve it so it's (49:45 - 49:51)
even better right that was kind of my (49:49 - 49:52)
thought process but that that just (49:51 - 49:54)
happened to be like I saw that one and I (49:52 - 49:57)
was like whoa that one has way more way (49:54 - 49:59)
more bars than I feel like a dodrio than (49:57 - 50:01)
I would have thought a doo would have (49:59 - 50:03)
but like obviously this game is (50:01 - 50:05)
different than yeah like I ended up (50:03 - 50:07)
catching a jolon earlier this week only (50:05 - 50:09)
because it was the only Pokemon (50:07 - 50:11)
hungry and I was like okay well it's (50:09 - 50:13)
hungry like I don't need the jolon so I (50:11 - 50:17)
like gave it my premium biscuit which (50:13 - 50:19)
was like 12 and then it needed only four (50:17 - 50:21)
more so jolon would have been 16 so I (50:19 - 50:23)
was like okay here's premium biscuit (50:21 - 50:25)
okay here's a greate biscuit here's a (50:23 - 50:27)
Pokeball okay you're caught and it was (50:25 - 50:29)
actually ended up being a really decent (50:27 - 50:33)
role jolon but like if it wasn't hungry (50:29 - 50:36)
and there if it because it was the only (50:33 - 50:39)
one hungry I was like well I don't (50:36 - 50:41)
really need yeah like I don't need the (50:39 - 50:43)
like igly buff I already have like a (50:41 - 50:46)
really good wiggly tff so I guess I'll (50:43 - 50:49)
I'll catch that but yeah like (50:46 - 50:53)
I it it's a weird thing where like the (50:49 - 50:55)
middle Pokemon or the final Pokemon are (50:53 - 50:57)
not really worth it but like you would (50:55 - 50:59)
kind of think like Dragonite or Tiner (50:57 - 51:01)
anatar is kind of worth it just because (50:59 - 51:03)
it requires so much experience so much (51:01 - 51:07)
candy to just even get to that level (51:03 - 51:10)
that it could be worth it at that point (51:07 - 51:12)
right um I guess that's why people are (51:10 - 51:13)
like I don't know master ball (51:12 - 51:16)
Den are they because the is actually (51:13 - 51:20)
like good is amazing no it sounds sounds (51:16 - 51:22)
like it from what we just talked about (51:20 - 51:24)
like 10 minutes ago like I didn't (51:22 - 51:28)
realize like the da could be so good uh (51:24 - 51:29)
I guess the other question I've never (51:28 - 51:31)
asked before and never really looked at (51:29 - 51:34)
like is there are there a certain amount (51:31 - 51:36)
of Pokemon in the game like are there a (51:34 - 51:37)
set amount of Pokemon in the game right (51:36 - 51:39)
now yeah when it when the game rolled (51:37 - 51:43)
out there was only 200 Pokemon and now (51:39 - 51:46)
there's 2011 or have there been updates (51:43 - 51:48)
since like 210 or something like that (51:46 - 51:51)
yeah 11 12 13 L (51:48 - 51:54)
220 okay and so whenever they do (51:51 - 51:56)
introduce a new one is it something that (51:54 - 51:58)
they kind of an like oh we're now going (51:56 - 52:00)
to have this one in the game or (51:58 - 52:03)
we're wow well when they (52:00 - 52:05)
announc when they announced lapis that (52:03 - 52:08)
brought like what like five new (52:05 - 52:11)
Pokemon brought like rals well five (52:08 - 52:15)
baselines okay five baselines (52:11 - 52:22)
Ralts Stuffle yeah Stuffle Dratini dra (52:15 - 52:25)
was came with Lapras did came with (52:22 - 52:27)
Lapras but they put on grass as well (52:25 - 52:30)
that would explain it yeah got it was (52:27 - 52:32)
there one more maybe maybe that was only (52:30 - 52:35)
four Pokemon so introduce new locations (52:32 - 52:37)
potentially with new po La was the first (52:35 - 52:40)
location they've announced in six months (52:37 - 52:42)
oh okay but to be fair like not a lot of (52:40 - 52:44)
people could get to lapis because it (52:42 - 52:48)
required so many sleep Styles (52:44 - 52:50)
yeah although I have been getting at (52:48 - 52:53)
least one more often two new sleep (52:50 - 52:55)
Styles a night with this event so I'm (52:53 - 52:58)
much closer than I was before (52:55 - 53:01)
yeah I'm like 10 Pokemon away from (52:58 - 53:04)
whatever the next area would be so (53:01 - 53:05)
whenever they what are your sleep style (53:04 - 53:09)
numbers at then like what is six to (53:05 - 53:11)
seven months of playing this game (53:09 - 53:13)
whether it's a lot or a little but what (53:11 - 53:15)
is that getting you sleep style wise so (53:13 - 53:19)
my not hardcore and also not paid player (53:15 - 53:22)
sleep style decks is at 24 (53:19 - 53:24)
Styles (53:22 - 53:28)
okay uh I want to say I'm over (53:24 - 53:32)
300 it could be (53:28 - 53:32)
wrong how where wait where do you see (53:34 - 53:38)
your sleep cyle you click on the place (53:35 - 53:41)
the next goal in the bottom right oh oh (53:38 - 53:43)
you just click on that a main menu (53:41 - 53:46)
there's a sleep style deex as well oh (53:43 - 53:48)
okay wait (53:46 - 53:52)
what so I have I have (53:48 - 53:54)
42 no mine just took me into my Pokéball (53:52 - 53:56)
plus thingy oh that's I clicked on the (53:54 - 53:57)
wrong button wrong button (53:56 - 54:01)
I'm at 2 287 so yeah just shy have (53:57 - 54:05)
300 okay yeah and I'm at 42 after two (54:01 - 54:08)
weeks of playing or (54:05 - 54:12)
yeah I think I think there's like four (54:08 - 54:13)
what is it it's like almost every (54:12 - 54:15)
Pokemon has like four sleep Styles some (54:13 - 54:17)
have three like raicho has three I think (54:15 - 54:20)
ditto has like eight sleep Styles but (54:17 - 54:21)
average has (54:20 - 54:28)
four and okay that makes sense yeah (54:21 - 54:28)
cool I feel like I'm sort of caught up (54:29 - 54:32)
now on sleep on Pokemon sleep on the (54:30 - 54:34)
game the one thing I've realized with (54:32 - 54:37)
Pokemon sleep before we take a break is (54:34 - 54:39)
that there's not really a good guide out (54:37 - 54:43)
there because yeah because I like when I (54:39 - 54:44)
stream on Twitch we'd like talk about (54:43 - 54:46)
sleep a lot because people will come and (54:44 - 54:47)
they'll be like I got like a shiny Rao (54:46 - 54:49)
last night like oh that's cool cool but (54:47 - 54:51)
like because we're talking about sleep (54:49 - 54:53)
so much other people are asking (54:51 - 54:56)
questions like Bobby Bobby is and then (54:53 - 54:58)
there like not anywhere I can like (54:56 - 55:01)
direct to be like like Hannah and I (54:58 - 55:02)
watch like this one YouTuber it's like (55:01 - 55:04)
the only YouTuber that does Pokemon (55:02 - 55:06)
sleep stuff and he'll do like analysis (55:04 - 55:08)
on like the den or whatever but like I (55:06 - 55:10)
wouldn't recommend somebody who's brand (55:08 - 55:12)
new go watch them because he's just GNA (55:10 - 55:14)
like talk to you about numbers of den (55:12 - 55:16)
and that's like not helpful he'll be (55:14 - 55:18)
like (55:16 - 55:22)
if like if one raicho main is worth one (55:18 - 55:23)
Diamond then (55:22 - 55:26)
like and like I like directing (55:23 - 55:31)
somebody's Cabe isn't helpful either and (55:26 - 55:33)
like you could maybe go to the subreddit (55:31 - 55:35)
like r/ pookemon sleep but like 99% of (55:33 - 55:37)
that subreddit is like is this a good (55:35 - 55:39)
Pokemon and it's like no of you're just (55:37 - 55:42)
bragging it is a good Pokemon of course (55:39 - 55:44)
it is it's like raicho with main skill (55:42 - 55:48)
up and like skill trigger medium like (55:44 - 55:50)
what are you wasting everyone's time (55:48 - 55:52)
that's every subreddit the TCG subreddit (55:50 - 55:54)
is this shining Tyranitar that I found (55:52 - 55:58)
in my attic a good card or or not like (55:54 - 55:59)
is this worth a lot first edition (55:58 - 56:00)
Charizard that I found in my Ants (55:59 - 56:03)
basement (56:00 - 56:06)
like yeah that's that's redit in general (56:03 - 56:10)
I just found all of these PSA 10 maridon (56:06 - 56:13)
EXs in the back of my car are these (56:10 - 56:15)
worth (56:13 - 56:15)
anything um so I I do plan on making a (56:16 - 56:23)
video hopefully in the next week that is (56:21 - 56:26)
like summarizing everything we've talked (56:23 - 56:28)
about in the last three weeks yeah like (56:26 - 56:30)
like hear a Pokemon you want to look for (56:28 - 56:33)
like don't waste your pokeballs on like (56:30 - 56:35)
a weeping Bell just focus on bells (56:33 - 56:37)
Sprout like try to get a really good (56:35 - 56:40)
iggly buff again I I know I know Hannah (56:37 - 56:42)
and I debate about the sleep (56:40 - 56:45)
calculator um and I don't use it anymore (56:42 - 56:48)
because I've just I've just learned (56:45 - 56:50)
like here like on ingredient man you (56:48 - 56:52)
want like main skill trigger on (56:50 - 56:53)
ingredient mod you want ingredient (56:52 - 56:54)
finder on a skill mod you want skill (56:53 - 56:58)
trigger like it's just breaking (56:54 - 56:58)
sleep would potentially just add in some (57:56 - 58:00)
way to the game where you can just see (57:58 - 58:03)
this similar kind of thing or is it not (58:00 - 58:05)
in the is it not similar I haven't (58:03 - 58:07)
looked at the calculator compated than (58:05 - 58:09)
than it makes that easy that's the kind (58:07 - 58:11)
of the problem I've had with Steve's (58:09 - 58:12)
calculator this whole time it just (58:11 - 58:15)
oversimplifies it there are too many (58:12 - 58:19)
factors that make it too complicated to (58:15 - 58:21)
kind of distill it all into a simple (58:19 - 58:23)
this is how good this Pokemon is one out (58:21 - 58:26)
of one to 100 see this is why I don't (58:23 - 58:28)
like Hannah's calculator cuz I think (58:26 - 58:31)
it's too complicated for an average (58:28 - 58:35)
person to be like put stuff in and I (58:31 - 58:36)
because (58:35 - 58:40)
like my calculator's my brain what no (58:36 - 58:42)
well the there there's like a there's (58:40 - 58:43)
like a more advanced calculator out (58:42 - 58:46)
there that you can put ingredients in (58:43 - 58:48)
yeah yeah yeah because (58:46 - 58:53)
like the thing that even ingredients (58:48 - 58:56)
matter to a point where like some people (58:53 - 59:01)
want a Stuffle that's like all corn (58:56 - 59:02)
because there's not a lot of Pokemon (59:01 - 59:04)
that gather (59:02 - 59:06)
corn and like I would want that too (59:04 - 59:08)
because I don't have like a lot of corn (59:06 - 59:11)
Pokemon that's a weird like I that's a (59:08 - 59:14)
weird sentence just to say by the way um (59:11 - 59:18)
but like I have a I have the most (59:14 - 59:21)
certified Blastoise Milkman in the (59:18 - 59:24)
entire world so like wait what could (59:21 - 59:27)
there be another sray (59:24 - 59:30)
milk Pokemon that I could get yes but (59:27 - 59:32)
I've already put so much investment into (59:30 - 59:34)
this Blastoise that like even if I got a (59:32 - 59:37)
good Pokemon with like milk as its rooll (59:34 - 59:38)
I probably wouldn't even use it because (59:37 - 59:42)
I just don't need more milk I'm just (59:38 - 59:44)
lactose intolerant right now I'm I'm (59:42 - 59:47)
good I don't need anything I need other (59:44 - 59:49)
food things so like when I'm looking (59:47 - 59:52)
through Pokemon now it's like oh great (59:49 - 59:56)
like this one has like uh the the fiery (59:52 - 59:58)
herb or whatever great like perfect I I (59:56 - 60:00)
I need that so when you're building a (59:58 - 60:02)
team it's not (60:00 - 60:05)
only matching berries or like I need (60:02 - 60:06)
energy for everyone I need ingredient (60:05 - 60:08)
finder I need helping skill it's also (60:06 - 60:12)
like looking at ingredients so I don't (60:08 - 60:13)
know it yeah I don't think I don't think (60:12 - 60:18)
a calculator just like solves (60:13 - 60:21)
that yeah no it's too complicated for (60:18 - 60:23)
that especially when you reroll each (60:21 - 60:25)
week with different berries on Green (60:23 - 60:27)
Grass and different events going on and (60:25 - 60:29)
you're getting a different kind of meal (60:27 - 60:30)
each week so you don't know which (60:29 - 60:32)
ingredients you're going to need every (60:30 - 60:33)
single week unless they tell you ahead (60:32 - 60:34)
of (60:33 - 60:37)
time yeah that's that's definitely tough (60:34 - 60:39)
because (60:37 - 60:41)
you if I remember this correctly you (60:39 - 60:43)
actually do choose your location every (60:41 - 60:45)
week right so like people can be on all (60:43 - 60:46)
different in all different places it's (60:45 - 60:48)
not like you're all in the same I mean (60:46 - 60:50)
everyone's on green grass this week (60:48 - 60:52)
because everyone wants a raicho but (60:50 - 60:54)
typically you'd be like there's what (60:52 - 60:56)
three or four or five locations that (60:54 - 60:58)
that you can choose from Once you have (60:56 - 61:01)
five I think yeah so it's tough then if (60:58 - 61:02)
all the (61:01 - 61:05)
locations are have different things (61:02 - 61:06)
dropping and like different stuff (61:05 - 61:08)
happening that might be that makes it a (61:06 - 61:10)
bit tougher rather than everyone being (61:08 - 61:12)
in the same place all the time also (61:10 - 61:13)
there will for sure there's already (61:12 - 61:15)
power creep in the game like Stuffle (61:13 - 61:19)
Dratini rals are like technically better (61:15 - 61:22)
than everything else for the most part (61:19 - 61:24)
so like there's also this weird thing in (61:22 - 61:26)
Pokemon sleep where like it's okay to (61:24 - 61:28)
get a Pokemon of 30 and then like stop (61:26 - 61:30)
leveling it after (61:28 - 61:32)
that like there are some Pokemon you do (61:30 - 61:34)
want to like level up to like a certain (61:32 - 61:36)
point and then like sounds like Pokemon (61:34 - 61:40)
go yeah it's it's similar like after (61:36 - 61:42)
level 30 then everything takes twice as (61:40 - 61:45)
much to get yeah you know as (61:42 - 61:49)
far um all right well uh Welcome to our (61:45 - 61:53)
Pokemon sleep podcast uh we're going to (61:49 - 61:55)
take a break uh when we come back uh we (61:53 - 61:59)
have three more things talk about uh so (61:55 - 62:02)
we will be right back and we are back (61:59 - 62:07)
from our break uh Bobby temporal (62:02 - 62:10)
forces yes you sent me uh was it (62:07 - 62:14)
Instagram DM or a text with like a video (62:10 - 62:17)
of like why is this card all of a sudden (62:14 - 62:20)
super expensive when the day before it (62:17 - 62:22)
was like (62:20 - 62:28)
$45 yeah so it's a fun preference maybe (62:22 - 62:30)
maybe we should explain uh temporal (62:28 - 62:34)
forces is the newest TCG set it came out (62:30 - 62:38)
um the 22nd I believe yeah last Friday (62:34 - 62:40)
yeah last Friday it came out the 22nd (62:38 - 62:43)
pre-release stuff was the 15th 16th 17th (62:40 - 62:45)
all that stuff so pre-release usually go (62:43 - 62:46)
to (62:45 - 62:51)
a a game store or a that's kind of you (62:46 - 62:52)
you go to like yeah you have to go to (62:51 - 62:54)
like a card shop or like a you go to a (62:52 - 62:57)
card shop you you get like a small (62:54 - 62:59)
uh deck you get like what like six (62:57 - 63:01)
booster packs or something four booster (62:59 - 63:03)
packs four booster packs and then you (63:01 - 63:05)
get the cards early by like (63:03 - 63:08)
participating in a pre-release and then (63:05 - 63:11)
following week the set came out um here (63:08 - 63:13)
are some cards Pokemon company sent this (63:11 - 63:15)
this is not good for our audio it's just (63:13 - 63:17)
a bunch of cards this is what they look (63:15 - 63:19)
like it came out that's not unusual (63:17 - 63:23)
cards come out every 3 months and (63:19 - 63:25)
then we know what prices are what people (63:23 - 63:30)
are going at after um but usually Cards (63:25 - 63:32)
start expensive when they come out and (63:30 - 63:35)
then they go down and this didn't happen (63:32 - 63:36)
with temporal (63:35 - 63:40)
forces yeah sort of so this is this is (63:36 - 63:43)
kind of how it went uh pre-release to to (63:40 - 63:45)
Steve's Point cards are usually higher (63:43 - 63:48)
priced because there are so few people (63:45 - 63:50)
opening them right so if you think when (63:48 - 63:53)
a set comes out and the big box stores (63:50 - 63:55)
have the cards and the local card shops (63:53 - 63:56)
have this the cards and the Pokémon (63:55 - 63:57)
Center is sending everyone their (63:56 - 63:59)
shipments of the cards there's a lot (63:57 - 64:02)
more cards in rotation so prices will (63:59 - 64:04)
typically drop when you're looking at (64:02 - 64:05)
like the singles prices because there's (64:04 - 64:08)
so many out there during the pre-release (64:05 - 64:10)
times only the local card shops are (64:08 - 64:13)
getting those pre-release kits so (64:10 - 64:16)
there's a lot less people opening cards (64:13 - 64:18)
during the week two weeks prior to a set (64:16 - 64:20)
releasing which means they're usually (64:18 - 64:22)
being resold at a much higher price (64:20 - 64:23)
because there are so few out there at (64:22 - 64:24)
that point in (64:23 - 64:28)
time this turned a little bit with the (64:24 - 64:30)
set on a couple of the cards and there (64:28 - 64:32)
are a couple reasons for it so set came (64:30 - 64:34)
out officially on March (64:32 - 64:38)
22 and the uh rarest cards in the set (64:34 - 64:40)
are are in this era of cards are called (64:38 - 64:42)
the special illustration rares they're (64:40 - 64:45)
really nice you know artworks full art (64:42 - 64:49)
cards and the cards were sitting there's (64:45 - 64:51)
about six of them that are Pokemon they (64:49 - 64:53)
were sitting at about 50 bucks a piece (64:51 - 64:56)
on day one so I think the highest was (64:53 - 64:58)
iron leaves and it was like $70 or (64:56 - 65:00)
something on day (64:58 - 65:04)
one day two all of a sudden iron Crown (65:00 - 65:06)
just iron Crown just the iron Crown (65:04 - 65:09)
special illustration rare went from $50 (65:06 - 65:12)
to $240 a card you could not find it for (65:09 - 65:16)
less than $240 on uh TCG players where (65:12 - 65:18)
people are typically looking for for (65:16 - 65:20)
these now owned by (65:18 - 65:26)
eBay right so uh $240 it had a $200 jump (65:20 - 65:30)
in one day and the funny thing is is (65:26 - 65:33)
that the next day it had a $100 drop and (65:30 - 65:36)
so it was $140 for this card the next (65:33 - 65:37)
day and then now it's been sitting at (65:36 - 65:40)
about $100 so about twice what it was a (65:37 - 65:43)
week ago when the set first released and (65:40 - 65:45)
if you follow what (65:43 - 65:48)
happened uh one thing is like there were (65:45 - 65:51)
so few listings of it available on TCG (65:48 - 65:53)
player that what it looks like is that (65:51 - 65:55)
they all got bought out at $50 and then (65:53 - 65:57)
every body just reposted them five times (65:55 - 66:00)
higher and posted them all at (65:57 - 66:03)
$250 um I'm assuming in hopes that (66:00 - 66:05)
people would see it at that price and (66:03 - 66:08)
then go to like say eBay or something (66:05 - 66:12)
and then see it for $150 or $100 and say (66:08 - 66:13)
oh well I better get it at that price (66:12 - 66:15)
now because if I look at the price of (66:13 - 66:18)
the card it's going for like (66:15 - 66:22)
$250 yeah and so there was that type of (66:18 - 66:24)
which isn't uncommon like that's this is (66:22 - 66:26)
not an uncommon thing the thing that is (66:24 - 66:29)
different is that it's uncommon in this (66:26 - 66:32)
era of Pokemon cards so since the (66:29 - 66:34)
scarlet and violet set the eras like era (66:32 - 66:39)
of cards there haven't been huge price (66:34 - 66:42)
hikes on on cards because the pull rates (66:39 - 66:46)
have been a little bit uh what like (66:42 - 66:51)
higher for cards um starting with the (66:46 - 66:53)
last regular set they they made the pull (66:51 - 66:55)
rates harder and with this set with (66:53 - 66:56)
temporal forces (66:55 - 66:59)
uh they have made the pull rates quite a (66:56 - 67:04)
bit harder on the rarest cards um so (66:59 - 67:07)
looking at data from like from like (67:04 - 67:09)
resellers like card shops people who (67:07 - 67:11)
open thousands of packs of cards so that (67:09 - 67:12)
they can turn around and sell the (67:11 - 67:15)
singles and things like that um they (67:12 - 67:17)
take like what they'll do is they'll (67:15 - 67:19)
take like an average on um a booster box (67:17 - 67:20)
which is the thing Steve was just (67:19 - 67:22)
showing like it's 36 packs of cards (67:20 - 67:24)
packed in a box um and they'll usually (67:22 - 67:26)
take an average of like how many of each (67:24 - 67:27)
of these types of cards you're going to (67:26 - 67:31)
get in a box um because the Pokemon (67:27 - 67:34)
company does not guarantee any like (67:31 - 67:37)
pulls out of international boxes in (67:34 - 67:40)
Japan they do the the boxes are seated (67:37 - 67:42)
so you're going to get a specific amount (67:40 - 67:44)
of in a Japanese booster box you're (67:42 - 67:45)
going to get one secret rare you're (67:44 - 67:47)
going to get three art rares you're (67:45 - 67:51)
going to get five or six double rares in (67:47 - 67:54)
outside of Japan nothing is (67:51 - 67:56)
guaranteed however there are Aver a (67:54 - 67:58)
right you open thousands of packs you do (67:56 - 68:00)
see averages on these booster (67:58 - 68:02)
boxes (68:00 - 68:05)
um one in three packs is like a hit (68:02 - 68:08)
whether that's a rare or or not a rare (68:05 - 68:10)
but like a double rare or higher double (68:08 - 68:13)
rare a triple rare quadruple rare yeah (68:10 - 68:16)
weird names for these Rarities since (68:13 - 68:19)
this era but so with the Scarlet Violet (68:16 - 68:22)
era booster boxes have typically come (68:19 - 68:25)
with two one to two special illustration (68:22 - 68:27)
rares in them that was just kind of the (68:25 - 68:30)
average for the first three regular sets (68:27 - 68:32)
of the Scarlet Violet era the fourth set (68:30 - 68:34)
came out last November that was parox (68:32 - 68:37)
Rift that average went down to about one (68:34 - 68:40)
special illustration rare per booster (68:37 - 68:42)
box this set temporal (68:40 - 68:45)
forces it's like kind of lucky if you're (68:42 - 68:47)
getting one special illustration (68:45 - 68:49)
whereare per booster box so they have (68:47 - 68:51)
they've gone from you were getting two (68:49 - 68:53)
of the rarest cards per Booster Box on (68:51 - 68:56)
average to maybe you don't get like (68:53 - 68:58)
maybe you get one but most likely aren't (68:56 - 69:01)
getting any at all so between that (68:58 - 69:03)
happening and people see like people (69:01 - 69:07)
seeing that and the set just coming out (69:03 - 69:09)
they did R raise the prices of a couple (69:07 - 69:11)
cards to where they were like kind of (69:09 - 69:13)
hard to get and I think what I'll say at (69:11 - 69:16)
the end of this is like don't buy single (69:13 - 69:18)
cards right like for the rarest cards (69:16 - 69:21)
don't buy the singles right now like (69:18 - 69:25)
wait a month wait two months maybe cuz (69:21 - 69:27)
those price will come down once more (69:25 - 69:29)
people are opening them up but because (69:27 - 69:30)
the pull rates are a little bit harder (69:29 - 69:33)
right now there are just less of them in (69:30 - 69:36)
rotation so they prices are are kind of (69:33 - 69:38)
going up on them a little bit but it (69:36 - 69:40)
will all even out it's just weird (69:38 - 69:42)
because there hadn't been a situation (69:40 - 69:45)
where the price of a card was jumping (69:42 - 69:47)
like five times what it was worth the (69:45 - 69:49)
day before yeah that was that was very (69:47 - 69:53)
new for this for this era of (69:49 - 69:58)
cards when I was at uh packs there was (69:53 - 70:00)
like a bunch of card sellers and (69:58 - 70:02)
obviously Pokemon and Magic but the one (70:00 - 70:04)
that the the the the stuff that stood (70:02 - 70:07)
out to me was the what is it lurana the (70:04 - 70:10)
Disney stuff and I was like oh I know (70:07 - 70:11)
nothing about this what is the most (70:10 - 70:13)
expensive card here and I'm like going (70:11 - 70:15)
up and down the list and I think the (70:13 - 70:17)
most expensive I saw was like (70:15 - 70:22)
250 um which was maybe like Cinderella I (70:17 - 70:25)
think I it's what it's what they had (70:22 - 70:26)
there maybe might maybe more expensive (70:25 - 70:28)
cards but at least in their case the (70:26 - 70:30)
most expensive one I saw was like 250 (70:28 - 70:34)
which I feel like 250 is like not that (70:30 - 70:36)
expensive compared to some Pokemon cards (70:34 - 70:40)
or some uh Magic card established games (70:36 - 70:43)
yeah yeah yeah definitely more more (70:40 - 70:44)
established games have some higher (70:43 - 70:47)
prices but yeah I know L lorana and then (70:44 - 70:49)
the other one that's really big right (70:47 - 70:52)
now was one piece yeah one piece boxes (70:49 - 70:54)
are real hard to come (70:52 - 70:56)
by um yeah (70:54 - 70:59)
but um yeah I would say just hold off on (70:56 - 71:01)
buying singles if you're going to buy (70:59 - 71:04)
rare the rarer cards yeah rarer cards (71:01 - 71:06)
the singles that I'm interested in the (71:04 - 71:08)
deerling and the saws Buck from this set (71:06 - 71:10)
are both less than $10 each they look so (71:08 - 71:13)
good though they are very good they are (71:10 - 71:16)
very good the the the um you know the (71:13 - 71:18)
artwork has always been good as time has (71:16 - 71:21)
gone on but these uh illustration rare (71:18 - 71:22)
cards and special illustration rare (71:21 - 71:24)
cards that they've kept up through this (71:22 - 71:27)
Scarlet Violet era are wonderful they're (71:24 - 71:30)
great so the artwork has always been (71:27 - 71:31)
good but I do feel like it keeps getting (71:30 - 71:33)
better I do feel like they've really (71:31 - 71:35)
invested in the artwork on Pokemon cards (71:33 - 71:40)
in the last few years yeah for (71:35 - 71:43)
sure uh okay so there was this wasn't (71:40 - 71:45)
really like an announcement like like (71:43 - 71:47)
the Pokemon company didn't get like come (71:45 - 71:49)
out and say we made a new F like we (71:47 - 71:52)
founded something new uh it was just (71:49 - 71:55)
legally it this had to be recorded and (71:52 - 71:57)
so because of the legal jargon people (71:55 - 72:01)
found out um this was actually uh a (71:57 - 72:03)
couple weeks ago but there's been a lot (72:01 - 72:05)
of news this and obviously nothing has (72:03 - 72:06)
happened since so it's not like this was (72:05 - 72:10)
going anywhere uh so this was on March (72:06 - 72:14)
4th uh something called Pokemon (72:10 - 72:17)
Works got created uh and I'm pulling (72:14 - 72:20)
right from sarabe if you go there's like (72:17 - 72:21)
a bunch of news articles about this but (72:20 - 72:24)
they all say the same thing plus their (72:21 - 72:27)
opinions but literally this is all we (72:24 - 72:30)
know so I promise you this is there's (72:27 - 72:33)
nothing more than this at present the (72:30 - 72:35)
company's focus is not known but it's a (72:33 - 72:38)
collaborative effort between the Pokemon (72:35 - 72:39)
company and (72:38 - 72:44)
ilka that's it founded on March 4th in (72:39 - 72:48)
Tokyo Japan it is called Pokemon (72:44 - 72:53)
Works w r k s like we hope that Pokemon (72:48 - 72:54)
is (72:53 - 72:57)
working un (72:54 - 72:57)
sure um here's the thing that I kind of (72:58 - 73:03)
want to bring (73:02 - 73:08)
up we don't know what ilka is doing I I (73:03 - 73:10)
I guess there is like speculation of (73:08 - 73:13)
like well before Pokemon day it was like (73:10 - 73:15)
Gen 5 remakes black and white 3 we're (73:13 - 73:17)
going to get (73:15 - 73:19)
something that didn't (73:17 - 73:23)
happen but but also like whether or not (73:19 - 73:30)
ilka is making a brilliant black shining (73:23 - 73:33)
white I hope it's called that I really (73:30 - 73:34)
hope that the black and white remakes (73:33 - 73:36)
are called that I I just want to stress (73:34 - 73:39)
that there is not a single ounce of (73:36 - 73:40)
evidence that they're working on (73:39 - 73:44)
anything now they could be making it (73:40 - 73:46)
that's that's possible but like nothing (73:44 - 73:48)
has come out being like yes Ila is for (73:46 - 73:51)
sure working on a Pokemon game we just (73:48 - 73:53)
don't know well I feel like this (73:51 - 73:57)
particular news does does maybe count as (73:53 - 73:59)
some evidence that they're working on (73:57 - 74:01)
something it counts as evidence that (73:59 - 74:04)
they're still working with Pokemon (74:01 - 74:06)
yeah (74:04 - 74:09)
yeah we do know that Ila does work on (74:06 - 74:13)
Pokemon home that we (74:09 - 74:13)
know uh yeah we like I know there's like (74:13 - 74:18)
a bunch of speculation out there I know (74:16 - 74:19)
there's like (74:18 - 74:23)
a obviously like a faithful whatever (74:19 - 74:26)
remake of Gen 5 would be next after Gen (74:23 - 74:29)
4 because they're they've been going in (74:26 - 74:31)
order with the exception of let's go (74:29 - 74:33)
Pikachu let's go e say let's make that (74:31 - 74:34)
exception (74:33 - 74:38)
please um but we we we just don't know (74:34 - 74:39)
what ilka is (74:38 - 74:43)
doing also just to also be transparent (74:39 - 74:46)
ilka does do other games for other (74:43 - 74:48)
people they do help on other games they (74:46 - 74:50)
have made other games uh specifically in (74:48 - 74:53)
the mobile department and and girl (74:50 - 74:56)
Department uh they have done that (74:53 - 74:58)
short of stuff they're not they're not (74:56 - 75:00)
owned by game freak they're not owned by (74:58 - 75:02)
the Pokemon company (75:00 - 75:06)
although there's a new (75:02 - 75:09)
company I don't know what that is right (75:06 - 75:11)
like no one knows what that is um (75:09 - 75:14)
Pokemon works is what it (75:11 - 75:20)
is now now we do know that massuda did (75:14 - 75:23)
overc brilliant Diamond shining Pearl at (75:20 - 75:27)
that point in time mudo was still (75:23 - 75:29)
working for game (75:27 - 75:33)
freak and massuda obviously director (75:29 - 75:35)
producer on a lot of Pokemon games (75:33 - 75:38)
composer to a lot of Pokemon music uh (75:35 - 75:40)
don't know when when they say that (75:38 - 75:42)
massuda oversaw brilliant Diamond (75:40 - 75:45)
shining Pearl we don't know what that ex (75:42 - 75:47)
the extent to that was we don't know how (75:45 - 75:51)
Hands-On or hands off he was for that he (75:47 - 75:53)
no longer works for Game Freak though he (75:51 - 75:57)
now works for the poke Pokemon company (75:53 - 76:01)
which is a different company than game (75:57 - 76:01)
freak collaborative effort between the (76:04 - 76:09)
Pokemon company and (76:07 - 76:11)
ilka yeah I don't know what this would (76:09 - 76:14)
be I would I would if I was to speculate (76:11 - 76:16)
I would agree with what Hannah is (76:14 - 76:17)
suggested is (76:16 - 76:20)
like it is has to be something Pokemon (76:17 - 76:22)
related going (76:20 - 76:26)
forward be weird if it wasn't like are (76:22 - 76:30)
are they are they saying now Ila is (76:26 - 76:32)
going to handle a lot of these older (76:30 - 76:37)
style remakes is Ila going to (76:32 - 76:40)
handle better updates or more (76:37 - 76:43)
advancements to Pokemon home like it it (76:40 - 76:46)
does kind of make sense to be (76:43 - 76:49)
like hey our future of Pokemon relies on (76:46 - 76:52)
all of these games intertwining together (76:49 - 76:56)
and we paid you to make that (76:52 - 76:59)
intertwinement which arguably like kind (76:56 - 77:03)
of it works but it works yeah it does (76:59 - 77:05)
work um so we want to like have a (77:03 - 77:09)
foundation of like we need this Pokemon (77:05 - 77:11)
home thing to like last for another 10 (77:09 - 77:14)
20 years and we need some sort of (77:11 - 77:17)
structure yeah well I wonder (77:14 - 77:20)
if this could possibly (77:17 - 77:23)
be like because you said Ila works on (77:20 - 77:25)
other things that aren't Pokemon related (77:23 - 77:27)
so I wonder if this could almost be (77:25 - 77:32)
like just a almost like a way to have a (77:27 - 77:35)
separate entity that is ilka's Pokemon (77:32 - 77:38)
works so the work the what the the (77:35 - 77:40)
Pokemon things that they do and so then (77:38 - 77:42)
that all be just would be housed under (77:40 - 77:45)
Pokemon works right so let's say home (77:42 - 77:48)
gets an update in a year or a black and (77:45 - 77:50)
white three comes out whatever the thing (77:48 - 77:52)
is that comes out um it's like the (77:50 - 77:54)
developer or like it could say like (77:52 - 77:57)
Pokemon works is theany behind it and (77:54 - 77:59)
that's just saying like oh that's what (77:57 - 78:02)
ilka does for Pokemon essentially um and (77:59 - 78:04)
just kind of how all of that (78:02 - 78:08)
Under The Entity of Pokemon works (78:04 - 78:10)
yeah a jokingly critical part of me (78:08 - 78:12)
thinks that maybe they're doing this so (78:10 - 78:14)
that on the next remakes they don't have (78:12 - 78:17)
to have the name ilka on it yeah that's (78:14 - 78:19)
actually yeah that (78:17 - 78:21)
like sort of what I was actually (78:19 - 78:22)
thinking (78:21 - 78:25)
to it'll just say Pokemon works you (78:22 - 78:26)
don't need to know you don't need to (78:25 - 78:29)
know right I mean like we joke about how (78:26 - 78:32)
bdsp are bad and I don't think any of us (78:29 - 78:34)
particularly liked that game that well (78:32 - 78:37)
joking about it I just it's just bad (78:34 - 78:39)
yeah and I I I was probably the most (78:37 - 78:42)
critical on it but I have also met (78:39 - 78:44)
people that are like oh I liked bdsp (78:42 - 78:47)
like and I I do think of like the bubble (78:44 - 78:51)
we're in (78:47 - 78:51)
of like really hardcore Pokemon players (78:51 - 78:57)
so we're more critical of things we're (78:54 - 79:00)
more aware of things right like when I (78:57 - 79:02)
was talking to Wood on his podcast the (79:00 - 79:05)
the nendo podcast and I was like man I (79:02 - 79:07)
hated in Legends when used to move like (79:05 - 79:09)
rock slide it would only hit one Pokemon (79:07 - 79:11)
instead of like all the Pokemon because (79:09 - 79:13)
that's just not Rockside just never (79:11 - 79:15)
worked like that and he was like oh I (79:13 - 79:17)
didn't even notice and I was like what (79:15 - 79:19)
you didn't notice you didn't notic that (79:17 - 79:22)
Rockside didn't hit like and he's like a (79:19 - 79:24)
hardcore video like he's in video games (79:22 - 79:26)
he's like a hardcore player but he's not (79:24 - 79:27)
like a (79:26 - 79:32)
hardcore Pokemon player MH um so I do (79:27 - 79:35)
wonder how many people that are not like (79:32 - 79:38)
hardcore bought bdsp and was like this (79:35 - 79:40)
is service like this is fine like I (79:38 - 79:42)
enjoyed it or is it just like the (79:40 - 79:44)
hardcore fans that are like I never want (79:42 - 79:48)
to see ilka's name (79:44 - 79:48)
again it's probably a mix a lot of (79:49 - 79:54)
people brought brilliant bought a lot of (79:52 - 79:56)
people bought brill Diamond shining (79:54 - 79:58)
Pearl we know that the numbers are very (79:56 - 80:01)
high for that game mhm I also know (79:58 - 80:04)
people who had kind of I know at least (80:01 - 80:07)
one gen 4 fan I think two who were (80:04 - 80:09)
really looking forward to it and looking (80:07 - 80:11)
forward to it being the game that (80:09 - 80:13)
brought them back to Pokemon and then we (80:11 - 80:16)
extremely disappointed by it so I don't (80:13 - 80:18)
think it's just the hardcore fans but (80:16 - 80:20)
I'm sure there are I also know some (80:18 - 80:22)
people who enjoyed it (80:20 - 80:26)
so I don't know yeah I think game I (80:22 - 80:29)
think there is something to being in the (80:26 - 80:33)
bubble like Steve was saying and also (80:29 - 80:35)
having I think there's a lot of people (80:33 - 80:39)
who are very vocal about how much they (80:35 - 80:41)
dislike the game right and what you hear (80:39 - 80:43)
from are people that are very vocal (80:41 - 80:45)
about you know you hear the you hear the (80:43 - 80:46)
worst and you hear the best right and (80:45 - 80:48)
you don't hear the middle so much and if (80:46 - 80:51)
people thought the game was fine I just (80:48 - 80:52)
I don't think there's a whole lot of (80:51 - 80:55)
people super vocal about how fine the (80:52 - 80:57)
game was right or like if they played (80:55 - 80:58)
through it and they were like yeah it (80:57 - 80:59)
was a Pokemon game like that was nice or (80:58 - 81:01)
like hey it was a revisit to CNO it was (80:59 - 81:04)
a revisit to a game that I played 10 (81:01 - 81:06)
years ago 15 years ago whatever it may (81:04 - 81:08)
be uh I don't think there's a whole lot (81:06 - 81:12)
of of that out there um so yeah I'm sure (81:08 - 81:14)
there are a lot more people and to your (81:12 - 81:16)
point like they sold a lot so clearly (81:14 - 81:19)
like people were buying it and now I (81:16 - 81:21)
guess like did they sell a lot initially (81:19 - 81:23)
and then it fell off or are they like (81:21 - 81:25)
consistently selling it after you know (81:23 - 81:28)
there's that question cuz I'm sure a ton (81:25 - 81:30)
of people bought it initially just cuz (81:28 - 81:31)
one it was a Pokemon game it was a (81:30 - 81:34)
November released Pokemon game you know (81:31 - 81:35)
yeah and (81:34 - 81:38)
two people didn't know I mean they they (81:35 - 81:39)
saw the trail we saw the trailers and (81:38 - 81:41)
everything but of course we're going to (81:39 - 81:43)
like buy it and play it and then when (81:41 - 81:48)
you played it and we're like oh this is (81:43 - 81:49)
this is what we're dealing (81:48 - 81:51)
with (81:49 - 81:53)
yeah my hope is that they learned some (81:51 - 81:57)
from some of the criticisms (81:53 - 81:57)
also needed to make an actual remake for (82:55 - 83:00)
CNO and that's when they brought Ela in (82:58 - 83:02)
for it but there's no proof on that I (83:00 - 83:05)
think well that would be good and fine (83:02 - 83:07)
so then what's their excuse for uh their (83:05 - 83:09)
own game of scarlet and violet and how (83:07 - 83:12)
broken that one's (83:09 - 83:14)
been it's not broken in all the same (83:12 - 83:17)
ways no yeah they're broken in different (83:14 - 83:21)
ways I I've been playing lets go for the (83:17 - 83:25)
last week mhm and it is crazy how (83:21 - 83:28)
polished that game is like s again s i i (83:25 - 83:30)
i i hate bring up let's go because (83:28 - 83:31)
people are like that's that's that's the (83:30 - 83:33)
worst game skipped it BL but they're (83:31 - 83:35)
just like they're just complaining about (83:33 - 83:36)
like the mo motion control which is like (83:35 - 83:38)
whatever like that's not even the part (83:36 - 83:40)
that bothers me about that game it's (83:38 - 83:42)
like I love the comment of that's the (83:40 - 83:44)
worst game I skipped it yeah I didn't (83:42 - 83:45)
give it any time I didn't play it I (83:44 - 83:47)
didn't try it at all it's the worst (83:45 - 83:51)
game um just's just like so much about (83:47 - 83:53)
let's go that is (83:51 - 83:55)
like for the record I don't think like (83:53 - 83:57)
let's go is a perfect game like there's (83:55 - 83:59)
like two trainers like right before you (83:57 - 84:01)
get to Vilan City that are standing far (83:59 - 84:03)
enough apart but not far enough apart (84:01 - 84:05)
where your character can't walk between (84:03 - 84:07)
them even though like visually your (84:05 - 84:09)
character should be able to walk between (84:07 - 84:14)
them um like there are issues but like (84:09 - 84:17)
there's just so many little things in (84:14 - 84:19)
let's go that just add up to like they (84:17 - 84:21)
thought about this or they cared about (84:19 - 84:24)
this or like again let's go is like the (84:21 - 84:27)
first first game to have the PC anywhere (84:24 - 84:29)
it's the first game to have Pokemon in (84:27 - 84:30)
the Overworld like when the shinies (84:29 - 84:33)
spawned in they had like sparkles around (84:30 - 84:36)
them you could lock a Pokemon so you (84:33 - 84:37)
didn't you couldn't accidentally throw (84:36 - 84:40)
it out like it was the first game with (84:37 - 84:42)
sizes even though like the sizes didn't (84:40 - 84:43)
like you could tell that they were like (84:42 - 84:45)
thinking ahead of like we want big (84:43 - 84:48)
Pokemon and we want small Pokemon there (84:45 - 84:51)
just like so many little things even (84:48 - 84:53)
like I when I was battling Misty I was (84:51 - 84:55)
like oh whoa she has like a sduck like (84:53 - 84:56)
she didn't have a Psyduck in like red (84:55 - 84:58)
and blue like that's like that makes (84:56 - 85:00)
sense she had the Psyduck in the anime (84:58 - 85:02)
and then like the Psyduck had confusion (85:00 - 85:03)
and I was like oh they gave it a psychic (85:02 - 85:05)
move I don't even like remember like (85:03 - 85:06)
yeah why would they not that's like a (85:05 - 85:08)
good like move pool for her to have and (85:06 - 85:10)
I was like okay cool that's fine I'll (85:08 - 85:13)
bring out my like Nino against like the (85:10 - 85:16)
the star me and I was like oh the star (85:13 - 85:18)
me has a psychic move too I thought I (85:16 - 85:20)
was like good here like I was (85:18 - 85:22)
like (85:20 - 85:25)
like even going into the gyms and how (85:22 - 85:26)
like the gyms are redesigned and they (85:25 - 85:28)
had like people in the stands like (85:26 - 85:29)
cheering you on and looking down and (85:28 - 85:31)
then I just like think of scarlet and (85:29 - 85:33)
violet and like we were watching like a (85:31 - 85:34)
tournament with scarlet and violet and (85:33 - 85:37)
they're on like the beach and it's like (85:34 - 85:39)
this empty Beach and there's like two (85:37 - 85:41)
grandmas the same exact model like (85:39 - 85:43)
behind you like cheering you on and (85:41 - 85:46)
you're like I can see both at the same (85:43 - 85:49)
time why is Grandma here twice cheering (85:46 - 85:51)
me on in scarlet and violet and you go (85:49 - 85:53)
into like Brock's gym and like I'm like (85:51 - 85:54)
counting the trainers and I was like (85:53 - 85:56)
there's so many many different trainers (85:54 - 86:00)
sitting in the stands that like you only (85:56 - 86:02)
really see for like 10 seconds because (86:00 - 86:04)
like they don't appear in battle but (86:02 - 86:05)
it's just like (86:04 - 86:08)
thematically feels so (86:05 - 86:12)
good but to be fair go grandma could (86:08 - 86:12)
have a (86:12 - 86:16)
twin just saying and let's go is a much (86:12 - 86:19)
smaller game it is it is smaller (86:16 - 86:23)
yeah it good details in scarlet and (86:19 - 86:25)
violet too I think there are plenty of (86:23 - 86:28)
small details that it's clear they put (86:25 - 86:31)
effort into that game it's just also (86:28 - 86:34)
clear There Are Places it falls short (86:31 - 86:35)
yeah they absolutely put effort into (86:34 - 86:37)
that game and I do and I do love scarlet (86:35 - 86:40)
and violet I I think we all do love (86:37 - 86:41)
scarlet and violet we still I'm still (86:40 - 86:43)
playing it I mean we all still play it (86:41 - 86:47)
like uh but I also really do love let's (86:43 - 86:50)
go and I love that the this the the (86:47 - 86:52)
animation style and just the way that (86:50 - 86:55)
they they did everything obviously very (86:52 - 86:56)
focused (86:55 - 87:01)
toward bringing go players into the (86:56 - 87:04)
theed console games yeah absolutely and (87:01 - 87:07)
it really did succeed um but yeah that (87:04 - 87:10)
game was great I'm just tired of (87:07 - 87:13)
Kanto yeah really tired of Kanto that's (87:10 - 87:16)
like a fair a fair complaint argument I (87:13 - 87:18)
remember like an like I I remember an (87:16 - 87:21)
Instagram comment of somebody saying uh (87:18 - 87:23)
let's go is just a watered down version (87:21 - 87:25)
of Pokemon Yellow and I was like you're (87:23 - 87:29)
just you're like one you're you're (87:25 - 87:32)
terribly wrong and two your argument (87:29 - 87:34)
doesn't even make sense like there's (87:32 - 87:37)
like the only thing that I you could (87:34 - 87:39)
maybe make the argument for of like (87:37 - 87:42)
being watered down is you can't battle (87:39 - 87:44)
wild Pokemon instead you have to catch (87:42 - 87:47)
them and I will die on the hill that (87:44 - 87:50)
battling wild Pokemon has not been fun (87:47 - 87:53)
or interesting in like a decade there is (87:50 - 87:56)
nothing like even going back to (87:53 - 88:00)
like sun and moon and you're like in the (87:56 - 88:02)
wormholes and you're like your only (88:00 - 88:05)
option to catch uh latas in the Wormhole (88:02 - 88:08)
is to put it to sleep and to false swipe (88:05 - 88:11)
it and then to just Chuck pokeballs like (88:08 - 88:13)
there like no one is doing that any (88:11 - 88:15)
different than what you are doing you (88:13 - 88:16)
are just putting it to sleep false (88:15 - 88:18)
swiping and just chucking as many Poke (88:16 - 88:21)
Balls as it just eliminate the middleman (88:18 - 88:22)
and let me Chuck pokeballs like in (88:21 - 88:25)
Legends archus I didn't battle a single (88:22 - 88:27)
wild Pokemon in Legends archus I just (88:25 - 88:29)
snuck behind it and hid it in the back (88:27 - 88:31)
of the head with a Pokeball and it made (88:29 - 88:34)
a really satisfying noise and then the (88:31 - 88:36)
little fireworks appeared and it was (88:34 - 88:38)
awesome but like I disagree with you (88:36 - 88:41)
here I disagree with you here I spent (88:38 - 88:44)
last night SOS hunting a hoot hoot so I (88:41 - 88:47)
could get a s one I knocked out 70 hoot (88:44 - 88:50)
hoot and then I did exactly what you (88:47 - 88:53)
said it popped up it was shiny I (88:50 - 88:56)
paralyzed it I (88:53 - 88:56)
after you catch Mewtwo that's really (89:54 - 89:58)
great they added megas it's a whole new (89:56 - 90:00)
storyline there are still people that (89:58 - 90:02)
don't like I could tell that you didn't (90:00 - 90:04)
play Let's Go Pikachu let's go Eevee (90:02 - 90:05)
because you'll say like oh it's the same (90:04 - 90:07)
story it's not it's a complete like blue (90:05 - 90:09)
shows up your rival's different like (90:07 - 90:11)
there's different like there are like (90:09 - 90:13)
set battles that are very similar and (90:11 - 90:15)
there's like the even like they expand (90:13 - 90:17)
on the the Marowak story line and then (90:15 - 90:20)
like spoiler your rival gets the Cubone (90:17 - 90:21)
that you end up saving and that's like (90:20 - 90:23)
really cool (90:21 - 90:27)
um there's Mega Evolution in the game (90:23 - 90:28)
surprisingly that they for whatever (90:27 - 90:30)
reason they're like we'll put Megas in (90:28 - 90:33)
yeah there's that weird candy system (90:30 - 90:35)
that is like exactly the same as Legends (90:33 - 90:37)
archus with grit where you like have to (90:35 - 90:41)
invest the candy into um and then on top (90:37 - 90:43)
of that not only are there more trainers (90:41 - 90:46)
on every route to battle which I think (90:43 - 90:48)
is actually a curse to me because I hate (90:46 - 90:50)
battling the dude with like five (90:48 - 90:52)
Magikarp they put more trainers on every (90:50 - 90:54)
route but also when you beat the game (90:52 - 90:56)
there's (90:54 - 91:00)
153 like brand new battles like it is a (90:56 - 91:03)
small game do they have meltan vers (91:00 - 91:05)
meltan and Mel metal vers Mel metal (91:03 - 91:07)
battle there I'm almost positive there's (91:05 - 91:09)
a there's a Mew vers Mew so there should (91:07 - 91:12)
be a meltan vers meltan interesting I (91:09 - 91:14)
know for sure there's Mew vers me and (91:12 - 91:16)
Mewtwo vers (91:14 - 91:18)
Mewtwo I actually don't know maybe (91:16 - 91:21)
there's 151 battles I think there's 153 (91:18 - 91:23)
I think there's a meltan vers (91:21 - 91:25)
meltan maybe there's not I thought it (91:23 - 91:29)
was 151 but I there's over (91:25 - 91:33)
150 there's over 150 battles post game (91:29 - 91:35)
and some of them are really clever like (91:33 - 91:37)
the Metapod vers Metapod is like (91:35 - 91:39)
ironically like dumb and funny but like (91:37 - 91:41)
like like the hitmon Lee versus hitmon (91:39 - 91:42)
Lee one is probably the most memorable (91:41 - 91:45)
one I had or gold bat versus goldbat was (91:42 - 91:48)
also really tricky and I I like those (91:45 - 91:51)
battles cuz they're not the traditional (91:48 - 91:54)
like I'm going to come in with like my (91:51 - 91:56)
Pikachu and you have five Magikarp and (91:54 - 91:57)
I'm just going to spam Thunderbolt like (91:56 - 91:59)
they like those battles felt like (91:57 - 92:01)
genuine puzzles there's a lot of battles (91:59 - 92:03)
where you could just like toxic protect (92:01 - 92:06)
or whatever like the chansy battle but (92:03 - 92:09)
you can't like the goldbat battle that (92:06 - 92:10)
doesn't work at all because you can't (92:09 - 92:13)
toxic goldbat because he's poison (92:10 - 92:17)
um anyways like again it's a small (92:13 - 92:21)
game but it's beautiful and there's like (92:17 - 92:24)
literally no actual like I'm not falling (92:21 - 92:27)
through the floor I'm not running at (92:24 - 92:28)
like three frames a (92:27 - 92:31)
second everything works wasn't wasn't (92:28 - 92:34)
let's go to the game where you would (92:31 - 92:38)
reset your RAM for shiny was that that (92:34 - 92:41)
yeah that was a real thing okay where (92:38 - 92:42)
got it I was just trying to think there (92:41 - 92:45)
was I know there was like a a shiny that (92:42 - 92:47)
was the reset the (92:45 - 92:49)
rovery yeah that was that was that was (92:47 - 92:53)
made up uh I I think you're you're (92:49 - 92:54)
what's funny is as you've been (92:53 - 92:56)
explaining all of this the bubble that (92:54 - 92:58)
we're in kind of showed up again right (92:56 - 93:00)
cuz it's like I think a lot of people (92:58 - 93:03)
that played let's go Pikachu let's go (93:00 - 93:05)
Evie whether they were a hardcore player (93:03 - 93:07)
or not they took it at like the the (93:05 - 93:09)
thought of like oh this is like Pokemon (93:07 - 93:11)
Yellow right and maybe the people that (93:09 - 93:13)
played Pokemon Yellow they might not (93:11 - 93:16)
remember like every single detail about (93:13 - 93:18)
Pokemon Yellow in the same way that you (93:16 - 93:20)
forced to play Pokemon Yellow before (93:18 - 93:22)
playing let's go and then suffer cuz (93:20 - 93:24)
those games are so hard to go back to (93:22 - 93:26)
they really are they really are they (93:24 - 93:29)
really are but uh I think that there are (93:26 - 93:32)
people who even if you are a hardcore (93:29 - 93:33)
player if you haven't played Pokemon (93:32 - 93:37)
Yellow in 20 years 25 years then it (93:33 - 93:38)
might be like you go play and you're (93:37 - 93:41)
like oh well yeah you start off with (93:38 - 93:42)
Pikachu if you picked the let's go (93:41 - 93:45)
Pikachu you you know get all three of (93:42 - 93:47)
the starters at some point you go (93:45 - 93:49)
through Kanto in the same way that you (93:47 - 93:51)
did like I can see where people are (93:49 - 93:55)
saying like this is water down in the (93:51 - 93:56)
sense of you don't get to battle wild (93:55 - 93:58)
Pokemon anymore you're just catching (93:56 - 94:00)
them like you do in Pokemon go and (93:58 - 94:02)
there's also the (94:00 - 94:05)
whole people that there was and I don't (94:02 - 94:07)
know what what that is like now but (94:05 - 94:09)
there was people who like really like (94:07 - 94:10)
the main Series games and then Pokemon (94:09 - 94:12)
go came out and it was like oh what's (94:10 - 94:14)
this Pokemon go it's not like the main (94:12 - 94:16)
series and they went integrated that (94:14 - 94:19)
into the main Series right and it was (94:16 - 94:20)
like oh what are you doing like these (94:19 - 94:22)
were separate like I could play my main (94:20 - 94:23)
Series game and not have to think about (94:22 - 94:25)
Pokemon go (94:23 - 94:26)
and then you kind of had to think about (94:25 - 94:29)
Pokemon go at a point you know so I I (94:26 - 94:30)
get that (94:29 - 94:32)
frustration but I still think Pokemon (94:30 - 94:35)
let's go is like a wonderful game and (94:32 - 94:39)
just very fun to play and very few bugs (94:35 - 94:42)
compared to some other Pokemon games (94:39 - 94:45)
it's a much smaller game it just which (94:42 - 94:46)
fine that can be the reason why there (94:45 - 94:49)
are less fine that helps with the bugs (94:46 - 94:51)
smaller games are fine that's fine like (94:49 - 94:54)
it was still very enjoyable uh you know (94:51 - 94:56)
um that that's not to say scarlet and (94:54 - 94:58)
violet isn't right scarlet and Violet's (94:56 - 95:00)
a completely different game a completely (94:58 - 95:02)
different game and that's fine and it's (95:00 - 95:05)
also a great game yeah I mean like Let (95:02 - 95:09)
Go has like 200 plus battles Legends (95:05 - 95:11)
archus has like (95:09 - 95:14)
seven and like six of those battles are (95:11 - 95:17)
against Volo and I appreciate Legends (95:14 - 95:19)
archus for that honestly like put in a (95:17 - 95:21)
few battles and make a really great end (95:19 - 95:24)
to that game that was great that was (95:21 - 95:26)
perfect (95:24 - 95:26)
uh speaking of battling it is Team (95:28 - 95:35)
Rocket week in Pokemon go probably my (95:31 - 95:37)
least favorite (95:35 - 95:42)
week ever I just don't I that whatever (95:37 - 95:44)
like 45 to 46 or whatever when you have (95:42 - 95:46)
to like battle like 400 that just killed (95:44 - 95:49)
me I don't know Steve we just had (95:46 - 95:52)
weather week that was pretty bad I I'll (95:49 - 95:53)
take this team go rocket week that (95:52 - 95:57)
weather week with the casts collection (95:53 - 96:00)
challenge was was rough there's not a (95:57 - 96:01)
collection challenge this week is there (96:00 - 96:03)
cuz I haven't started rocket stuff no (96:01 - 96:08)
there isn't uh there there was a a timed (96:03 - 96:11)
research I believe is the it was like a (96:08 - 96:12)
rocket (96:11 - 96:14)
takeover there was a time research where (96:12 - 96:15)
you had to catch 25 it was like you (96:14 - 96:18)
catch 25 dark type Pokemon and then (96:15 - 96:20)
there's a step two it's like catching (96:18 - 96:22)
purified and Sh catching Shadow Pokemon (96:20 - 96:24)
and purifying Pokemon and then there is (96:22 - 96:27)
a paid research ticket that you can buy (96:24 - 96:32)
for um $1.99 uh US dollars at least and (96:27 - 96:35)
um that is just (96:32 - 96:37)
uh that one is just battling team go (96:35 - 96:39)
rocket grunts it's like battle six team (96:37 - 96:42)
go rocket Grunts and you get some you (96:39 - 96:43)
get a rocket radar you get like a super (96:42 - 96:47)
incubator you get a paard encounter is (96:43 - 96:49)
better than a SE dot better than C dot (96:47 - 96:53)
better than C Dot and uh and all of that (96:49 - 96:55)
so (96:53 - 96:57)
yeah well speaking of money uh they (96:55 - 97:02)
announced what uh month two of the (96:57 - 97:04)
Wonder (97:02 - 97:06)
ticket uh (97:04 - 97:10)
which was the $10 ticket that would last (97:06 - 97:14)
for three months which on paper sounded (97:10 - 97:16)
great because it was like replacing you (97:14 - 97:21)
buying three $5 tickets mhm but the $5 (97:16 - 97:24)
ones that they did last season were you (97:21 - 97:26)
got got an incubator every day you got (97:24 - 97:27)
like (97:26 - 97:31)
extra gift storage yep um you got like (97:27 - 97:33)
bonus for your first spin of the day and (97:31 - 97:35)
your first Catch of the Day this ticket (97:33 - 97:38)
has none of that for the record but what (97:35 - 97:41)
if you did buy the 999 (97:38 - 97:45)
ticket uh you can get encounters with (97:41 - 97:48)
Eevee with a cherry blossom vapore they (97:45 - 97:50)
all have cherry blossoms Vaporeon jolon (97:48 - 97:53)
Flareon Espeon Umbreon Leafeon glacian (97:50 - 97:54)
Sylveon so (97:53 - 97:57)
there's what nine spawns right there you (97:54 - 97:59)
also get a lucky egg a pfin an incense (97:57 - 98:02)
two charge TMS that's worthless One (97:59 - 98:04)
Premium battle pass three silver pin (98:02 - 98:08)
apps one star piece and more Niantic (98:04 - 98:11)
please tell me what is more exciting (98:08 - 98:13)
than what you just told (98:11 - 98:14)
us (98:13 - 98:16)
[Music] (98:14 - 98:19)
yeah and then new flowers if you forgot (98:16 - 98:23)
what the first part included that was a (98:19 - 98:25)
piple helmet (98:23 - 98:27)
an encounter with Pokemon I don't they (98:25 - 98:28)
don't Niantic doesn't even remember what (98:27 - 98:31)
Pokemon you encountered a premium raid (98:28 - 98:33)
pass a lucky egg an incense a star piece (98:31 - 98:36)
and more stay tuned to see what part (98:33 - 98:38)
three would (98:36 - 98:41)
be these aren't new flowers but the only (98:38 - 98:42)
time we've seen them before I think were (98:41 - 98:44)
the spring was the spring into spring (98:42 - 98:47)
event last year almost a full year ago (98:44 - 98:49)
they were new then okay got it okay that (98:47 - 98:54)
makes sense um there is very little that (98:49 - 98:57)
they could introduce in J wait what what (98:54 - 98:59)
month are we in uh so next month's April (98:57 - 99:00)
so there's very little they could (98:59 - 99:04)
introduce in May that would be that (99:00 - 99:06)
would make the this ticket this $10 (99:04 - 99:10)
ticket worth anything like one of the $5 (99:06 - 99:12)
tickets was in the last season where you (99:10 - 99:15)
got an incubator every single day for a (99:12 - 99:18)
month it's wild how we're even able to (99:15 - 99:20)
compare these that they are technically (99:18 - 99:22)
supposed to be the same thing but in (99:20 - 99:26)
execution they are really not yeah one (99:22 - 99:29)
is $5 (99:26 - 99:29)
cheaper you got for $15 in that season (99:29 - 99:35)
you got like (99:33 - 99:38)
92 incubators if you did whatever if you (99:35 - 99:39)
did every (99:38 - 99:42)
day you can't even you can't even start (99:39 - 99:46)
to compare those to each other that's (99:42 - 99:48)
it's so (99:46 - 99:52)
different I don't know yeah (99:48 - 99:52)
I I I was hoping when they said $9 or (99:52 - 99:59)
$10 for three months I was like this is (99:56 - 100:01)
awesome you guys this is the right (99:59 - 100:04)
direction no more like if I have to buy (100:01 - 100:06)
$10 every three months instead of $5 (100:04 - 100:10)
every month like sign me up saving (100:06 - 100:12)
money (100:10 - 100:15)
uh this is so (100:12 - 100:19)
lackluster yeah I we better get 75 (100:15 - 100:21)
incubators next month or (100:19 - 100:24)
something or else I don't see anywhere (100:21 - 100:27)
near comparison to this last season I (100:24 - 100:30)
like maybe they went with really high (100:27 - 100:32)
the first season that they were doing (100:30 - 100:33)
because that was the first (100:32 - 100:36)
season they did this was last season (100:33 - 100:39)
right they've done similar things before (100:36 - 100:41)
that but but where it was like time (100:39 - 100:43)
seasonal where it was like said like (100:41 - 100:44)
okay this is going to be for the next (100:43 - 100:47)
three months kind of thing so they maybe (100:44 - 100:50)
they went really big season 1 they're (100:47 - 100:52)
going really low season two andas (100:50 - 100:54)
thinking and trying to figure out Middle (100:52 - 100:56)
Ground like kind of even it out a little (100:54 - 101:00)
bit or it was just them putting out (100:56 - 101:02)
something in the winter time the things (101:00 - 101:03)
that cost money in the winter time are (101:02 - 101:06)
usually the most exciting parts of (101:03 - 101:09)
Pokemon go in that in those in that (101:06 - 101:12)
season yeah that's true they could have (101:09 - 101:15)
also been a little bit of a gear gearing (101:12 - 101:18)
up for like c tour like giving items and (101:15 - 101:19)
things that you could then cuz I know (101:18 - 101:22)
people that were like using saving stuff (101:19 - 101:23)
and being like Oh well I'm going to use (101:22 - 101:25)
this all during tour cuz we're I saved (101:23 - 101:27)
all M saving the incubators oh I don't (101:25 - 101:29)
have that selfcontrol so I did not do (101:27 - 101:32)
that but uh but you know saving up all (101:29 - 101:34)
that for c tour and then using it all at (101:32 - 101:37)
once and now it's like getting into go (101:34 - 101:40)
Fest but I feel like they could maybe (101:37 - 101:42)
summer this this next season they you (101:40 - 101:44)
know could jump it up or even next month (101:42 - 101:45)
like I said maybe they may maybe we're (101:44 - 101:47)
going to get 75 incubators next month (101:45 - 101:52)
who knows or in May but yeah no not as (101:47 - 101:53)
good uh there there was a new event (101:52 - 101:56)
event they announced for London from (101:53 - 101:58)
March 29th to April 15th they are (101:56 - 102:00)

off a special bundle which is two (102:03 - 102:07)
incense two super incubators two lucky (102:05 - 102:09)
eggs for 320 coins see this is what I (102:07 - 102:13)
was talking about this is a good deal (102:09 - 102:15)
compared to Something in Pokemon (102:13 - 102:17)
sleep you can't even get something this (102:15 - 102:19)
cheap in Pokemon sleep yeah you got to (102:17 - 102:21)
take out a loan to your house to buy a (102:19 - 102:25)
good camp ticket in Pokemon sleep (102:21 - 102:25)
uh this uh offer is only for UK and (102:26 - 102:32)
Ireland players uh so you can still get (102:29 - 102:34)
that even if you can't go to the Fest uh (102:32 - 102:36)
if you do go to the in-person thing uh (102:34 - 102:39)
there's field research there's timed (102:36 - 102:42)
research um lurs will last three hours (102:39 - 102:45)
you will have a chance of spawning (102:42 - 102:48)
unknown L and they're saying that the (102:45 - 102:50)
unknown will not be shiny your buddy (102:48 - 102:52)
will have more assist chance half (102:50 - 102:54)
Stardust for Lucky tra (102:52 - 102:57)
I think this is like great for like a (102:54 - 103:01)
local small event like it's enough to (102:57 - 103:02)
reward the players that are there but (103:01 - 103:04)
it's not enough where like oh my gosh (103:02 - 103:07)
like I need to book a ticket because I (103:04 - 103:09)
can't miss a Pokemon go inperson event (103:07 - 103:11)
like it's not enough for that I wish (103:09 - 103:13)
they would just do this more for other (103:11 - 103:17)
events like Gamescom just happened there (103:13 - 103:19)
was they used to do stuff for packs I (103:17 - 103:21)
don't know why they stopped doing stuff (103:19 - 103:24)
for packs uh there was several packs in (103:21 - 103:25)
a row where they would spawn unknown (103:24 - 103:28)
that spelled packs uh around the (103:25 - 103:30)
convention center there was that one (103:28 - 103:32)
event in San Diego that Bobby went to (103:30 - 103:34)
around like let go where they were like (103:32 - 103:36)
spawning other unknown what did it say (103:34 - 103:39)
like GAA or something oh in in La that (103:36 - 103:42)
was a thing it was at E3 it was at E3 in (103:39 - 103:45)
La they were an they were um I think it (103:42 - 103:49)
was let's go I think it was L TS goo (103:45 - 103:52)
were the oh yeah I think you're right (103:49 - 103:54)
yeah it was let's go uh that was up in (103:52 - 103:56)
yeah that was up in La they've did um (103:54 - 103:58)
unknown around uh around the convention (103:56 - 104:00)
center in San Diego for twitchcon as (103:58 - 104:02)
well as ComicCon in the past oh yeah (104:00 - 104:04)
they did do one for twitchcon one year (104:02 - 104:06)
and they had special stop they had like (104:04 - 104:10)
three extra stops inside the convention (104:06 - 104:13)
center just saying like twitchcon or (104:10 - 104:16)
whatever like they added extra heavy on (104:13 - 104:19)
unknown at all of these events like all (104:16 - 104:21)
of these different events used to have (104:19 - 104:22)
that's why I always felt like I was (104:21 - 104:24)
missing out on unknown because I never (104:22 - 104:26)
got to go to any of those or to any of (104:24 - 104:28)
the in-person (104:26 - 104:33)
um yearly events and so for years I (104:28 - 104:36)
never got into the unknown Collection (104:33 - 104:38)
part of Pokemon go and the only time I (104:36 - 104:42)
think it started was at the Go fests in (104:38 - 104:45)
2020h when they became when they started (104:42 - 104:48)
becoming more available yeah no they (104:45 - 104:50)
they used to do them I I have an unknown (104:48 - 104:53)
why because my friend went to Comic Con (104:50 - 104:55)
in New York and in New York they had (104:53 - 104:57)
they were spawning unknown n and and (104:55 - 105:00)
unknown y or something like that like um (104:57 - 105:01)
and then the same kind of thing with San (105:00 - 105:03)
Diego's Comic-Con they would do things (105:01 - 105:04)
like that as well so there were a lot of (105:03 - 105:07)
events where they had them spawning and (105:04 - 105:10)
then they just stopped I like I forget (105:07 - 105:12)
what the first event was where we (105:10 - 105:15)
thought like they would have unknown (105:12 - 105:17)
spawning and then they didn't and it was (105:15 - 105:21)
like oh no they decided yeah was didn't (105:17 - 105:25)
lay off like well yeah this 200 people (105:21 - 105:28)
this was even year that they do still do (105:25 - 105:31)
special spawns for regionals for Pokemon (105:28 - 105:34)
Regionals Events oh do they yep and (105:31 - 105:36)
they've actually ramped that up more in (105:34 - 105:39)
recent years I think I don't know if (105:36 - 105:40)
it's still the same but at least for a (105:39 - 105:42)
time they were spawning a lot of very (105:40 - 105:44)
competitively viable Pokemon around (105:42 - 105:47)
regionals oh that's cool along with the (105:44 - 105:50)
local uh Elemental (105:47 - 105:55)
monkey oh yeah yeah I just I I just I I (105:50 - 105:57)
don't know how hard it is to like set up (105:55 - 106:00)
an event or like a Geo fence in Pokémon (105:57 - 106:02)
go or how hard it is to be like we need (106:00 - 106:04)
to add like four stops here and we need (106:02 - 106:06)
these Pokemon to spawn in this Geo fence (106:04 - 106:08)
but I just feel like there'd be so much (106:06 - 106:10)
Goodwill if like there was a team of (106:08 - 106:12)
like two or three people at Niantic just (106:10 - 106:13)
dedicated (106:12 - 106:16)
to all of the like there's constant (106:13 - 106:19)
events like Gamescom E3 well E3 doesn't (106:16 - 106:24)
exist anymore packs um ComicCon (106:19 - 106:24)
uh (106:24 - 106:27)
c2e2 something in Australia that I can't (106:24 - 106:29)
think of events in Japan something in (106:27 - 106:32)
Germany I can't think of there's just (106:29 - 106:34)
constant events yeah and I just feel (106:32 - 106:36)
like if you're looking for player (106:34 - 106:38)
retention if you're looking to get new (106:36 - 106:39)
people (106:38 - 106:42)
to do your game if you're looking for I (106:39 - 106:44)
don't know the thing you've been saying (106:42 - 106:46)
which is like we want more people to do (106:44 - 106:49)
things in person make things in person (106:46 - 106:50)
then (106:49 - 106:54)
like it's so easy for me to Vince people (106:50 - 106:56)
around me at a convention to open (106:54 - 106:59)
Pokémon go when something exciting is (106:56 - 107:02)
happening in Pokémon go like unknown (106:59 - 107:05)
spelling packs is not that exciting to a (107:02 - 107:09)
hardcore player but super easy to be (107:05 - 107:11)
like hey there's a special Pokemon go (107:09 - 107:12)
event here you haven't opened Pokemon go (107:11 - 107:14)
in two months you should open it and (107:12 - 107:16)
collect these three letters (107:14 - 107:21)
like add more things to do yeah I don't (107:16 - 107:25)
I don't get it I don't get like how (107:21 - 107:26)
maybe Niantic doesn't get it because (107:25 - 107:28)
they laid off 200 people because profits (107:26 - 107:31)
are more important than like growing (107:28 - 107:35)
your game I guess but yeah (107:31 - 107:37)
it and they did it for here they did it (107:35 - 107:39)
for London gamefest I'm just saying do (107:37 - 107:40)
it what whoever's in charge whoever did (107:39 - 107:44)
this London's game Fest do that more (107:40 - 107:46)
give that person a (107:44 - 107:49)
raise give that person more ability to (107:46 - 107:50)
do more (107:49 - 107:55)
events why did they I (107:50 - 107:55)
[Music] (108:07 - 108:10)
you worried (108:53 - 108:57)
about I don't know fix the that issue (108:54 - 108:59)
like I like I don't take away things (108:57 - 109:01)
from people like don't say like well (108:59 - 109:03)
we're not going they laid off too many (109:01 - 109:06)
people yeah I just it I don't know I (109:03 - 109:08)
don't understand this (109:06 - 109:10)
like sometimes it'll be shiny sometimes (109:08 - 109:11)
like it just it's out there just have it (109:10 - 109:14)
be shiny just and make it you know make (109:11 - 109:15)
it harder to be shiny I don't know but (109:14 - 109:18)
like I I think it's weird when they take (109:15 - 109:21)
that stuff away when it's been available (109:18 - 109:24)
at other events or previously um because (109:21 - 109:26)
you you do get you're going to get the (109:24 - 109:28)
players who don't have unknown that's (109:26 - 109:30)
exciting or just getting more unknown L (109:28 - 109:32)
you don't have unknown L whatever and (109:30 - 109:34)
then you have players who like they have (109:32 - 109:38)
150 unknown L but like just make it (109:34 - 109:40)
shiny give it a chance to be shiny and (109:38 - 109:41)
those people are also going to be like (109:40 - 109:43)
oh cool like great I can maybe get a (109:41 - 109:45)
shiny one am I remembering right that in (109:43 - 109:48)
the past shiny unknown has only be only (109:45 - 109:49)
been available to people who have paid (109:48 - 109:52)
money for a (109:49 - 109:52)
ticket no uh somebody got a shiny (109:52 - 109:58)
unknown at like a global go Fest and (109:55 - 110:00)
they didn't they didn't have a no maybe (109:58 - 110:02)
they did have a (110:00 - 110:05)
ticket cuz wasn't unknown is only ticket (110:02 - 110:07)
holder plus incense spawn right I think (110:05 - 110:11)
so most of the time the there wasn't a (110:07 - 110:14)
cotor (110:11 - 110:14)
ticket what Global ticket was there yeah (110:14 - 110:22)
yeah there was was free cinor was free (110:18 - 110:25)
for the global event yeah but you had to (110:22 - 110:28)
have an incense yeah to get unnown which (110:25 - 110:30)
is still technically a pay (110:28 - 110:33)
wall popping in incense is still (110:30 - 110:35)
technically are the London Games unknown (110:33 - 110:37)
that are spawning not off incense (110:35 - 110:38)
they're just spawning throughout the (110:37 - 110:40)
event they should just be spawning (110:38 - 110:42)
that's how it worked at packs they did (110:40 - 110:45)
not say you need incense to spawn these (110:42 - 110:49)
okay the ones in ComicCon were not (110:45 - 110:51)
incense spawns can the unknown that (110:49 - 110:55)
spawn in the world just like randomly be (110:51 - 110:59)
shiny I would assume so I mean who's (110:55 - 111:00)
seeing that you're you're more likely to (110:59 - 111:01)
win the lottery than to see like a (111:00 - 111:03)
random wild unknown that's not true (111:01 - 111:05)
spoofers spoofers are seeing that (111:03 - 111:07)
they're seeing them everywhere uh no (111:05 - 111:10)
yeah but I just was wondering (111:07 - 111:10)
if more I don't know why that just like (111:11 - 111:15)
hit (111:14 - 111:19)
me wasn't unknown F in raids after a go (111:15 - 111:22)
Fest and it was shiny but it was like (111:19 - 111:24)
one in 512 but it was like the only way (111:22 - 111:28)
to get shiny unknown F was to (111:24 - 111:30)
do dollar (111:28 - 111:33)
raids cuz I don't think unknown shiny F (111:30 - 111:35)
has ever been in the wild I think it's (111:33 - 111:39)
only been in raids unknown shiny F (111:35 - 111:43)
you're saying yeah wow now we're getting (111:39 - 111:45)
realic I'm not sure you know how we (111:43 - 111:47)
talked about we're in this (111:45 - 111:50)
bubble this is the bubble right (111:47 - 111:54)
now uh but even I mean with if that's (111:50 - 111:55)
the case like you can still do free (111:54 - 111:58)
raids there's not a pay wall there like (111:55 - 111:59)
you can still get you still have a (111:58 - 112:01)
chance at a shiny unknown with a free (111:59 - 112:03)
raid yeah it's (112:01 - 112:07)
true yeah what you do I mean like it's a (112:03 - 112:09)
one in 512 chance but you can literally (112:07 - 112:12)
go do a free free pass for one week it's (112:09 - 112:15)
spawning and you can get an a shiny (112:12 - 112:17)
unknown it's very technical like it's (112:15 - 112:19)
very splitting hairs I guess but like (112:17 - 112:22)
it's technically free I guess you got to (112:19 - 112:24)
I don't know I guess the direction I'm (112:22 - 112:27)
going in is just it would make sense (112:24 - 112:29)
based on what they have done with shiny (112:27 - 112:32)
unknown for it to be able to be shiny if (112:29 - 112:36)
the player bought the special bundle (112:32 - 112:38)
maybe if it was a ticket instead of just (112:36 - 112:41)
a bundle but here's that seems like a (112:38 - 112:43)
lot for such a small thing that's true (112:41 - 112:44)
I'm gonna I want well we'll end on this (112:43 - 112:47)
because this Show's almost two hours uh (112:44 - 112:49)
if you made it this far thank you for (112:47 - 112:51)
listening if you're watching on YouTube (112:49 - 112:53)
feel free to like comment subscribe tell (112:51 - 112:55)
tell me how your REO week went in the (112:53 - 112:58)
comments okay there's my wait if I say (112:55 - 113:00)
like hit the like button I think it's (112:58 - 113:03)
supposed to like light up on YouTube so (113:00 - 113:04)
hey hit that like button on YouTube and (113:03 - 113:06)
comment below and let me know if that (113:04 - 113:09)
worked when I said that out loud I (113:06 - 113:10)
actually want to know if that worked (113:09 - 113:11)
I've seen it work on somebody else's (113:10 - 113:16)
YouTube channel um okay the one thing I (113:11 - 113:19)
never understood with Niantic is because (113:16 - 113:22)
they care about spoofing and I would I (113:19 - 113:24)
would probably if if I was to bet I (113:22 - 113:26)
would bet the unknown is not shiny (113:24 - 113:28)
because they don't want people to spoof (113:26 - 113:31)
there that would be my guess yeah but (113:28 - 113:32)
like what I never understood is when (113:31 - 113:34)
they released the lake Spirits for the (113:32 - 113:36)
first (113:34 - 113:39)
time that some people were like sh that (113:36 - 113:42)
they got all three now I want to remind (113:39 - 113:44)
people that the lake Spirits were when (113:42 - 113:45)
they were released they were only (113:44 - 113:47)
spawning in the wild they were only (113:45 - 113:49)
spawning near rivers they were in three (113:47 - 113:51)
different (113:49 - 113:54)
continents or whatever ever and they (113:51 - 113:56)
were incredibly rare there were they (113:54 - 113:57)
were not in raids there was no remote (113:56 - 114:00)
raid passes at the time and the within (113:57 - 114:02)
24 hours there were tons of people being (114:00 - 114:05)
like I got all three and there would be (114:02 - 114:08)
no physical way to do that even if you (114:05 - 114:11)
like booked a flight to go from Asia to (114:08 - 114:15)
to the UK to America you would still (114:11 - 114:19)
have to find it in the wild which is (114:15 - 114:22)
I've never found in the five years (114:19 - 114:23)
they've been in the wild never seen one (114:22 - 114:25)
in the wild that isn't like a go Fest or (114:23 - 114:27)
whatever ever they they're still in the (114:25 - 114:29)
game you can still find them randomly (114:27 - 114:30)
right (114:29 - 114:32)
now why didn't Niantic ban all those (114:30 - 114:34)
people they know they know that that's (114:32 - 114:36)
physically not possible they could have (114:34 - 114:39)
been like we found like 2,000 people (114:36 - 114:40)
that just they have all three in their (114:39 - 114:42)
account within 24 hours ban all of those (114:40 - 114:45)
people instantly you what what your (114:42 - 114:47)
whatever software you're using to like (114:45 - 114:51)
find hackers is not as good as looking (114:47 - 114:53)
at three Lake spirits in their account (114:51 - 114:58)
this just it's imp just ban them (114:53 - 114:58)
all they know which Pokemon are in (114:59 - 115:03)
people's (115:02 - 115:06)
accounts it's been like five years since (115:03 - 115:11)
that happened Steve why did they do (115:06 - 115:11)
it you're you're a little (115:12 - 115:18)
late I'm pretty sure I had this ran 5 (115:15 - 115:20)
years ago (115:18 - 115:22)
as this is what I go to sleep thinking (115:20 - 115:25)
about why didn't I antic find Steve I (115:22 - 115:27)
would love it if if you could actually (115:25 - 115:31)
cut to a clip for the YouTube of if you (115:27 - 115:32)
oh was it wasn't you weren't recording (115:31 - 115:34)
this on YouTube five years agoing video (115:32 - 115:35)
cut to an audio clip of like five years (115:34 - 115:38)
ago of you making this exactly rant cuz (115:35 - 115:40)
guarantee pretty sure it's exactly the (115:38 - 115:43)
same somebody figure out which episode (115:40 - 115:44)
that (115:43 - 115:47)
was I don't (115:44 - 115:50)
remember it's it's the same for like (115:47 - 115:52)
it's the it would be the same for the (115:50 - 115:54)
unknown L though like they could turn it (115:52 - 115:57)
on to bait spoofers and they could be (115:54 - 115:58)
like oh you were literally just in (115:57 - 116:01)
Australia you randomly caught a shiny (115:58 - 116:03)
unknown L and now you're back in (116:01 - 116:05)
Australia like I I get that they (116:03 - 116:08)
possibly don't want to (116:05 - 116:10)
ban somebody who might have actually (116:08 - 116:13)
flown from Australia to UK caught an (116:10 - 116:15)
unknown and flown back but (116:13 - 116:18)
like we know how long a flight takes you (116:15 - 116:22)
know exactly at what time people catch (116:18 - 116:24)
Pokemon yeah that's just getting very (116:22 - 116:27)
specific and hard to automate at that (116:24 - 116:30)
point in some (116:27 - 116:32)
ways there are a lot of Pokemon go (116:30 - 116:34)
trainers I'm I'm gonna guess they're not (116:32 - 116:37)
going to use London Games to (116:34 - 116:40)
like catch a bunch of (116:37 - 116:43)
spoofers this is our (116:40 - 116:43)
opportunity also I think like I don't (116:44 - 116:48)
like I don't care if somebody spoofs to (116:46 - 116:50)
get a shiny unknown L that doesn't like (116:48 - 116:53)
affect me it does affect me though if (116:50 - 116:55)
there and I'm like oh you turned off the (116:53 - 116:59)
L's because of other people like what (116:55 - 117:00)
does it matter it's not like it's a (116:59 - 117:02)
competitive Pokemon (117:00 - 117:06)
anyway yeah could people people could (117:02 - 117:08)
spoof could could buy like the LA cot (117:06 - 117:11)
tour ticket and then spoof into that (117:08 - 117:13)
into LA to do that right like the one (117:11 - 117:15)
that you had to there wasn't a way to (117:13 - 117:17)
like so there's not a way to keep people (117:15 - 117:19)
out from even like the purchasing the (117:17 - 117:21)
ticket (117:19 - 117:25)
somehow yeah yeah you could you would (117:21 - 117:28)
buy the ticket set up your thing to to (117:25 - 117:30)
get your little character to walk around (117:28 - 117:32)
I don't however they do it right right (117:30 - 117:34)
there was there was like a lot of (117:32 - 117:38)
spoofing people on Tik Tok where I would (117:34 - 117:39)
be scrolling and they would be doing a (117:38 - 117:41)
live where they like have their name (117:39 - 117:43)
covered up because that's like a big way (117:41 - 117:45)
that ni can tell obviously if you just (117:43 - 117:48)
show your trainer name (117:45 - 117:51)
yeah so they would always have like (117:48 - 117:53)
their name covered up but then some of (117:51 - 117:56)
the spoofing software would also like (117:53 - 117:58)
remove your name from when you joined a (117:56 - 118:00)
raid which I thought was interesting I (117:58 - 118:01)
only watched this because I was like I (118:00 - 118:02)
actually don't know how these people (118:01 - 118:04)
operate so like they would join a raid (118:02 - 118:06)
and everyone else's name would show but (118:04 - 118:09)
their name would be invisible which was (118:06 - 118:11)
interesting (118:09 - 118:14)
um but man I got them for like two (118:11 - 118:16)
months straight like different people (118:14 - 118:18)
who and now I don't see them at all (118:16 - 118:19)
anymore so I don't know if the algorithm (118:18 - 118:22)
just doesn't do it but I would also see (118:19 - 118:24)
them come back can be like oh Niantic (118:22 - 118:26)
banned my account so this is my (118:24 - 118:29)
secondary account and then like they (118:26 - 118:30)
would be like oh Niantic just banned (118:29 - 118:31)
that one so this is my third account I (118:30 - 118:35)
don't understand like (118:31 - 118:38)
the like you're so addicted to a game (118:35 - 118:40)
that you have to like cheat in to have (118:38 - 118:43)
fun but then you're also getting your (118:40 - 118:45)
accounts banned yeah they're doing the (118:43 - 118:47)
thing that's crazy to me is they're (118:45 - 118:51)
doing things that cost money like raing (118:47 - 118:54)
and inviting people to raids cost you (118:51 - 118:57)
money right and to be like oh it's going (118:54 - 119:01)
to get Bann it might get banned tring (118:57 - 119:02)
you know maybe they're like getting (119:01 - 119:04)
Pokemon and then trading it to like a (119:02 - 119:05)
main account that is their actual (119:04 - 119:07)
account and then they have they're (119:05 - 119:09)
catching all these cool Pokemon and then (119:07 - 119:10)
they have them on their main account (119:09 - 119:12)
right and then that account gets banned (119:10 - 119:14)
they set up another one they're trading (119:12 - 119:15)
all that stuff to their main account (119:14 - 119:17)
that one gets banned but their main (119:15 - 119:19)
account now has all these like shiny (119:17 - 119:21)
Pokemon all these cool Pokemon all these (119:19 - 119:24)
whatever like Pokemon on I'm just (119:21 - 119:26)
thinking like that's possibly a reason (119:24 - 119:28)
that people I don't know because I don't (119:26 - 119:30)
understand the whole like spending money (119:28 - 119:32)
getting account ban to just get another (119:30 - 119:34)
one spend money to get an account ban (119:32 - 119:35)
but if they're trading it off to like (119:34 - 119:37)
another main account where they're (119:35 - 119:38)
getting to keep all their Pokemon and (119:37 - 119:40)
getting to keep all that stuff then (119:38 - 119:43)
maybe that is it's worth it to someone (119:40 - 119:45)
out there I guess I I don't know if you (119:43 - 119:47)
care about shining Pokemon just buy (119:45 - 119:49)
scarlet and (119:47 - 119:51)
violet it's a onetime fee you can get (119:49 - 119:53)
all the shinies you want shiny (119:51 - 119:56)
legendaries scarlet and violet is not it (119:53 - 119:58)
though that's (119:56 - 120:02)
true that's very that's very true can I (119:58 - 120:05)
convince you to buy sword and (120:02 - 120:08)
shield a little bit easier to get shiny (120:05 - 120:10)
Legends in that game you have a better (120:08 - 120:11)
chance of getting a shiny legendary in (120:10 - 120:13)
Pokemon sleep right now than you would (120:11 - 120:16)
in h scarlet and violet right I mean (120:13 - 120:18)
that's true you can at least get a shiny (120:16 - 120:21)
raicho you can at least get get (120:18 - 120:23)
one that's been our for the week thanks (120:21 - 120:25)
for listening (120:23 - 120:29)
um uh we will be back next week I also (120:25 - 120:34)
uh I will be at the so next weekend is (120:29 - 120:37)
the Europe International (120:34 - 120:40)
championships um and there will be a (120:37 - 120:43)
distribution for an iron hands there so (120:40 - 120:46)
I'll post that code on um Instagram and (120:43 - 120:48)
Twitter and all that stuff when that (120:46 - 120:50)
that goes up it will it it should only (120:48 - 120:52)
be available for that weekend so just a (120:50 - 120:55)
heads up like once the competition is (120:52 - 120:57)
over that code usually goes (120:55 - 120:59)
deactive so that's time limited there's (120:57 - 121:01)
like a spatio right now that you can get (120:59 - 121:02)
that's good till September there's like (121:01 - 121:04)
a pmo you can get right now in scarland (121:02 - 121:06)
Violet that's good until like the end of (121:04 - 121:07)
the year so you got plenty of time on (121:06 - 121:10)
those and the week after uh which I (121:07 - 121:14)
think is April 12th 13th 14th I'll (121:10 - 121:17)
actually be in Florida for the regional (121:14 - 121:23)
event uh down there um and I think (121:17 - 121:25)
that will be Mega Heracross (121:23 - 121:29)
debut um so I might go (121:25 - 121:32)
to Disney for that mostly because I (121:29 - 121:34)
might have gotten a free ticket to (121:32 - 121:36)
Disney but also I've heard Disney is a (121:34 - 121:38)
really good place to play Pogo one I've (121:36 - 121:40)
never been to Disney in my entire life I (121:38 - 121:43)
was a still poor but grew up very poor (121:40 - 121:46)
so Disney was never on the the the (121:43 - 121:49)
docket uh so I I want to see what the (121:46 - 121:52)
Disney Experience is like compared to (121:49 - 121:54)
like all of America experience I give (121:52 - 121:56)
you firsthand reporting on that but also (121:54 - 121:58)
I think it's a good place to probably do (121:56 - 122:01)
Mega raids right like I'm assuming (121:58 - 122:03)
everyone says Disney's good to be wait (122:01 - 122:05)
is Mega Heracross coming out that (122:03 - 122:07)
weekend because the Regionals are in (122:05 - 122:09)
Florida (122:07 - 122:12)
and it's just we that weekend it just so (122:09 - 122:14)
happened it's just a coincidence that (122:12 - 122:17)
maybe maybe I mean it's just as it's (122:14 - 122:18)
possible but you're giving Niantic way (122:17 - 122:21)
too much credit right now (122:18 - 122:24)
yeah um I think though uh on that (122:21 - 122:26)
Saturday uh I'll try to do a community (122:24 - 122:29)
Meetup in the free part of Disney which (122:26 - 122:32)
I don't know what that's called Disney (122:29 - 122:35)
Springs um I think I think that's the (122:32 - 122:38)
free part uh so I'll I'll post something (122:35 - 122:40)
in like Discord and slack because I know (122:38 - 122:42)
there's surprisingly a lot of people (122:40 - 122:43)
that live in Florida I didn't know if (122:42 - 122:45)
you guys knew this but it's a very (122:43 - 122:48)
populated state not a very good State I (122:45 - 122:51)
will say but a very populated state oh (122:48 - 122:54)
no (122:51 - 122:55)
yeah I'm not going to say anything about (122:54 - 122:57)
Florida you can direct all your stuff to (122:55 - 123:00)
Steve on that no one could possibly (122:57 - 123:02)
defend (123:00 - 123:05)
Florida the one thing they have is (123:02 - 123:07)
Disney that's (123:05 - 123:10)
it (123:07 - 123:12)
Universal (123:10 - 123:15)
yep even people who live in Florida hate (123:12 - 123:17)
Florida come on we all know (123:15 - 123:20)
this uh okay uh so I'll keep you guys (123:17 - 123:23)
updated on that as we get closer to the (123:20 - 123:27)
Regionals and all that stuff (123:23 - 123:29)
so thank you Hannah thank you Bobby (123:27 - 123:31)
