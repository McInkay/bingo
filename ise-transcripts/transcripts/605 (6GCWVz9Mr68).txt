America Hannah will also still be in (1:23 - 1:29)
America I'll be in a different part than (1:26 - 1:31)
you all though yeah (1:29 - 1:34)
yeah so uh we we have to record this (1:31 - 1:36)
early so it's edited and then it just (1:34 - 1:38)
goes up so we don't miss a Monday so if (1:36 - 1:43)
there is any Pokemon news the the (1:38 - 1:44)
there's a time difference here we're (1:43 - 1:47)
literally recording this H what is it (1:44 - 1:52)
eight days early yeah um but that's okay (1:47 - 1:54)
uh this episode is going to be our (1:52 - 1:57)
predictions SL what we want SL what we (1:54 - 2:00)
don't want for Pokemon day um (1:57 - 2:03)
because I get asked that question a (2:00 - 2:06)
million times and uh then we could be (2:03 - 2:09)
wrong on February 27th when Pokemon day (2:06 - 2:11)
happens you can go back and be like oh (2:09 - 2:13)
look at how wrong you three were and (2:11 - 2:17)
that's that's fun in a sense so no news (2:13 - 2:19)
this episode was if there is any crazy (2:17 - 2:21)
breaking news when this comes out on the (2:19 - 2:23)
19th just know that it's recorded early (2:21 - 2:25)
so that's pretty much all this episode (2:23 - 2:28)
is hopefully they won't be releasing (2:25 - 2:30)
news like less than a week before for (2:28 - 2:32)
Pokémon D like that would be that would (2:30 - 2:34)
be weird not (2:32 - 2:34)
great they (2:35 - 2:40)
released they they released a little bit (2:38 - 2:43)
this week it seems like we're starting (2:40 - 2:45)
to predict some of the things they may (2:43 - 2:49)
be coming out with yeah yeah uh we can (2:45 - 2:51)
get to that do you want to you do want (2:49 - 2:54)
to start Hannah with what they released (2:51 - 2:57)
this week and maybe what that leads into (2:54 - 3:00)
for Pokemon day (2:57 - 3:02)
hopefully we're thinking of the same (3:00 - 3:05)
thing I am thinking of the card yes that (3:02 - 3:09)
they announced okay yes they released a (3:05 - 3:12)
s or announced a suru Edge card that I (3:09 - 3:15)
don't have the press release in front of (3:12 - 3:19)
me but they will be uh giving out a suru (3:15 - 3:21)
ledge card at least in the US and in (3:19 - 3:23)
Canada I know that for sure that people (3:21 - 3:25)
will be able to pick up from a couple of (3:23 - 3:27)
different retailers I believe it's (3:25 - 3:30)
GameStop and Best Buy here in the US (3:27 - 3:33)
starting on something like the 24th or (3:30 - 3:36)
the 23rd a little before Pokemon (3:33 - 3:39)
day and it has a little Pokemon day (3:36 - 3:40)
stamp on (3:39 - 3:43)
it uh yeah and you can also get the card (3:40 - 3:44)
relates to the (3:43 - 3:48)
anime yes which is leading to my (3:44 - 3:49)
prediction which I still think is going (3:48 - 3:50)
to (3:49 - 3:53)
happen the the Rayquaza yeah it's been (3:50 - 3:55)
the Rayquaza the entire time it will (3:53 - 3:58)
always be the Rayquaza uh so yeah the (3:55 - 3:59)
the the sural edge card you can also get (3:58 - 4:01)
from Pokemon Center it say free with (3:59 - 4:03)
purchase um they didn't say how much (4:01 - 4:05)
purchase is usually that's like 20 bucks (4:03 - 4:09)
or 15 bucks or that's what my guess (4:05 - 4:11)
would be I don't know I missed the free (4:09 - 4:12)
with purchase part I was thinking of (4:11 - 4:15)
walking in and picking one up but I mean (4:12 - 4:16)
it could be that Best Buy and GameStop (4:15 - 4:18)
does not care and you can walk in and (4:16 - 4:21)
pick one up uh I'm probably just going (4:18 - 4:23)
to the safer route and just order (4:21 - 4:25)
something from the Pokemon Center and (4:23 - 4:29)
just not deal with humans talking to (4:25 - 4:30)
me (4:29 - 4:31)
don't have to deal with any of the (4:30 - 4:34)
transportation then either that's yeah (4:31 - 4:36)
that's that's true they did um so yeah (4:34 - 4:38)
suru Edge is supposed to be in The (4:36 - 4:40)
Horizon's anime supposed to be it's not (4:38 - 4:43)
like it hasn't been out for a (4:40 - 4:46)
year who knows how many how many (4:43 - 4:48)
episodes are out there for you now (4:46 - 4:51)
Al 18 I think something like that quite (4:48 - 4:53)
a (4:51 - 4:55)
few more than the 12 that you've been (4:53 - 4:58)
getting in drops so even when you get (4:55 - 5:00)
your drop we'll be ahead of you (4:58 - 5:02)
we have seen the character that has suru (5:00 - 5:05)
Edge even in the little trailers and the (5:02 - 5:07)
first 10 minutes of the first episode (5:05 - 5:09)
they released in English a good time ago (5:07 - 5:12)
on YouTube I believe the character is (5:09 - 5:15)
some sort of uh minor antagonist like (5:12 - 5:17)
rival to the main (5:15 - 5:20)
characters so I think it's interesting (5:17 - 5:21)
that they're giving you the rivals (5:20 - 5:24)
Pokemon (5:21 - 5:26)
yeah is this is this like I could be (5:24 - 5:28)
wrong I haven't seen more than the first (5:26 - 5:30)
10 minutes I don't know what say right (5:28 - 5:32)
cuz it's not it's not it's not in the (5:30 - 5:33)
first couple of episodes and it's like I (5:32 - 5:36)
don't want to be spoiling oh sure (5:33 - 5:38)
sure um yeah then they did like a (5:36 - 5:42)
dragapult ceru Edge Short yeah little (5:38 - 5:44)
animated (5:42 - 5:49)
short uh because dragapult is a gen n (5:44 - 5:51)
Pokemon H Al without spoiling too much (5:49 - 5:53)
is there a dragapult in the anime is (5:51 - 5:56)
that why the short dragapult I don't (5:53 - 5:58)
remember one (5:56 - 6:00)
um that doesn't mean that there isn't (5:58 - 6:01)
one but it's not it's certainly not as (6:00 - 6:05)
prominent as the cedge if it is there (6:01 - 6:07)
okay um yeah I think I saw a lot of (6:05 - 6:09)
confusion of why it wasn't sured vers (6:07 - 6:11)
armor Rouge in this like little short (6:09 - 6:12)
they (6:11 - 6:14)
did (6:12 - 6:17)
but I don't know two Ghost Pokemon I (6:14 - 6:19)
guess I mean the poor little gimme ghoul (6:17 - 6:22)
gets stepped on and he's a ghost as well (6:19 - 6:24)
in the in the (6:22 - 6:26)
short always possible they were trying (6:24 - 6:28)
to involve one of the dragons for a year (6:26 - 6:31)
of the dragon that seems to be another (6:28 - 6:33)
thing they are leaning heavy into this (6:31 - 6:36)
year yeah yeah they're doing um this is (6:33 - 6:38)
not like a a prediction or anything I (6:36 - 6:39)
guess it's news that we wouldn't be (6:38 - 6:42)
talking about in the last week's episode (6:39 - 6:45)
but they're so on pokemoncenter.com they (6:42 - 6:47)
have usually done like here is something (6:45 - 6:51)
you can buy every month and so they did (6:47 - 6:53)
those like fun c-ops but they weren't (6:51 - 6:55)
fun c-ops they were like made by Funko (6:53 - 6:56)
but they didn't have the weird eyes so (6:55 - 6:58)
they did Pikachu that one year and then (6:56 - 7:00)
they did Eevee (6:58 - 7:03)
the next and then they they did like the (7:00 - 7:04)
ceramic things one year where it was (7:03 - 7:05)
like 12 (7:04 - 7:07)
Ceramics and I think they did something (7:05 - 7:09)
else last year that I can't remember the (7:07 - 7:10)
only one I like committed to was like (7:09 - 7:13)
the initial Pikachu ones that they first (7:10 - 7:15)
did because they actually looked good (7:13 - 7:18)
and they were 15 bucks or whatever um (7:15 - 7:21)
this year they're doing Dragon pins and (7:18 - 7:24)
they're $12.99 and they're really cool (7:21 - 7:27)
looking and I think the first one is (7:24 - 7:30)
Garchomp uh yes the first one is gar CHP (7:27 - 7:32)
and it has not sold out yet which my (7:30 - 7:35)
prediction is we're going to get uh (7:32 - 7:38)
brilliant Platinum shining Platinum for (7:35 - 7:40)
the Garchomp confirmed that's why (7:38 - 7:42)
they're starting off with Garchomp we're (7:40 - 7:44)
finally going to get our (7:42 - 7:47)
Platinum no I love the I love the idea (7:44 - 7:48)
of them releasing two versions of (7:47 - 7:50)
platinum we still have to have two (7:48 - 7:52)
versions that's what we (7:50 - 7:55)
do they learned their lesson from (7:52 - 7:57)
Legends it didn't get as high sales (7:55 - 7:59)
numbers cuz there was only one of it (7:57 - 8:02)
right we have to double dip (7:59 - 8:04)
constantly um yeah the the year the (8:02 - 8:06)
dragon pins are (8:04 - 8:08)
cool okay but this leads into my first (8:06 - 8:12)
serious prediction uh which is the the (8:08 - 8:15)
sevenstar Shiny Rayquaza in scarlet and (8:12 - 8:18)
violet they're leaning into the suru (8:15 - 8:22)
edge with the anime we know that Shiny (8:18 - 8:24)
Rayquaza is coming to Pokemon unite so (8:22 - 8:26)
they didn't give up on (8:24 - 8:29)
that that concept alog together and and (8:26 - 8:32)
they have done a sevenstar or just a (8:29 - 8:35)
raid event I don't know by the time this (8:32 - 8:37)
episode goes up if my YouTube video goes (8:35 - 8:40)
up I like spent four hours documenting (8:37 - 8:41)
every single Pokemon day and what (8:40 - 8:43)
actually happened on Pokemon day and (8:41 - 8:47)
what didn't and uh for the last five (8:43 - 8:49)
years there has been a raid event on (8:47 - 8:51)
Pokemon day a lot of those raid events (8:49 - 8:54)
were (8:51 - 8:54)
Pikachu yeah but the there was this (8:55 - 9:01)
there was the the the hard Mewtwo in in (8:58 - 9:02)
sword and (9:01 - 9:04)
shield um that everyone I I think (9:02 - 9:06)
everyone loved I the Mewtwo and sword (9:04 - 9:08)
and shield I thought it was cool there (9:06 - 9:10)
was the gigantamax Blastoise Venusaur (9:08 - 9:12)
and Charizard in sword and shield there (9:10 - 9:15)
was the um gigantamax Pikachu in sword (9:12 - 9:17)
and shield and there was the water terot (9:15 - 9:21)
type Pikachu and Scarlet and violet um (9:17 - 9:23)
and there was one more that I can't (9:21 - 9:26)
think of but there's no way there's not (9:23 - 9:28)
going to be a seven (9:26 - 9:31)
star right like I think we're (9:28 - 9:34)
all on board with yeah yeah it's an easy (9:31 - 9:36)
thing for them to do that builds up hype (9:34 - 9:39)
without them having to do much right (9:36 - 9:41)
easy pattern for them to continue that (9:39 - 9:43)
too um assuming they don't manage to (9:41 - 9:47)
break the game with it again um true but (9:43 - 9:48)
here's my question have we I don't think (9:47 - 9:51)
we've had a scarlet and violet Raid (9:48 - 9:54)
event that isn't catchable yet have we (9:51 - 9:56)
that catch I think I think they let you (9:54 - 9:58)
catch the Rayquaza because you can only (9:56 - 10:00)
catch one I think you think it will let (9:58 - 10:04)
you cuz interesting I mean it's possible (10:00 - 10:05)
it just we had we did have the M the (10:04 - 10:07)
Mewtwo that you were mentioning and (10:05 - 10:12)
there was the the Zer one as well um (10:07 - 10:13)
neither of them were (10:12 - 10:17)
catchable I think if if sword and shield (10:13 - 10:19)
raids weren't they weren't like broken I (10:17 - 10:20)
don't want to say like they weren't (10:19 - 10:22)
broken but I don't think they figured (10:20 - 10:25)
out how you could only catch one (10:22 - 10:28)
right okay so like I feel like (10:25 - 10:30)
definitely done that here (10:28 - 10:33)
if ersy Fu or glri ins Spector if you (10:30 - 10:35)
could only catch one and they weren't (10:33 - 10:38)
like weirdly programmed not weirdly (10:35 - 10:39)
programmed they were just they probably (10:38 - 10:42)
just didn't think of that at the time I (10:39 - 10:44)
think those raids would have been more (10:42 - 10:46)
exciting than like oh you can battle (10:44 - 10:48)
glass your inspectre or you can't do (10:46 - 10:49)
anything with them except battle them (10:48 - 10:51)
it's like why would I even do that at (10:49 - 10:53)
least with the Zer Ora it was like (10:51 - 10:56)
battle what a half a million Zer Ora and (10:53 - 10:59)
then you get we will send you one (10:56 - 11:01)
through Pokemon home yeah yeah yeah so (10:59 - 11:03)
this would be like you can do Shiny (11:01 - 11:05)
Rayquaza this is my guess and then you (11:03 - 11:08)
can catch one of them and then you can (11:05 - 11:10)
keep doing it for rewards just like the (11:08 - 11:12)
mightiest Mark (11:10 - 11:15)
Mewtwo yeah yeah I guess that makes (11:12 - 11:18)
sense because if you if it's not that (11:15 - 11:20)
it's a particularly difficult thing to (11:18 - 11:22)
if you have caught this then make you (11:20 - 11:24)
not not let you catch it again um if you (11:22 - 11:26)
hadn't thought about that from when you (11:24 - 11:28)
were initially implementing raids it's (11:26 - 11:30)
probably more difficult to implement (11:28 - 11:32)
that later on whereas if they then (11:30 - 11:34)
thought oh we'd really like to do this (11:32 - 11:35)
one where you can only catch one and the (11:34 - 11:37)
programmers went why didn't you telling (11:35 - 11:39)
us this now he should have told us that (11:37 - 11:41)
two years ago and so they're well we'll (11:39 - 11:42)
put that into the into the list of (11:41 - 11:44)
things to do for scarlet and violet and (11:42 - 11:47)
that's why we got them in this one yeah (11:44 - 11:49)
and while we haven't had a legendary (11:47 - 11:53)
shiny like this distributed in raids (11:49 - 11:56)
before we have had distributed legendary (11:53 - 11:58)
shinies in the past that's true so that (11:56 - 11:59)
wouldn't be a fully new thing I just (11:58 - 12:01)
found two of them in an old cartridge a (11:59 - 12:03)
couple days (12:01 - 12:08)
ago I also like compare a lot of if you (12:03 - 12:10)
don't play Pokemon go maybe you don't (12:08 - 12:12)
understand this but there are certain (12:10 - 12:14)
legendaries in Pokemon go that brings (12:12 - 12:17)
back people SL makes Niantic a lot of (12:14 - 12:21)
money and the number one is (12:17 - 12:25)
Mewtwo anytime Mewtwo comes back like (12:21 - 12:27)
the the amount of players just in a (12:25 - 12:30)
general area wanting to do (12:27 - 12:34)
dramatically increases even my mom who (12:30 - 12:37)
like she still plays Pokémon go for (12:34 - 12:39)
years she was like the only Pokemon I (12:37 - 12:41)
care about is Mewtwo like I just want a (12:39 - 12:43)
Mewtwo in poke I'm like what the (12:41 - 12:45)
Mewtwo's appeared like six times and (12:43 - 12:47)
she's like I never got it the first six (12:45 - 12:49)
times I want the meww I was like okay (12:47 - 12:51)
well let's go get a Mewtwo this weekend (12:49 - 12:55)
um the second Pokemon that I think is (12:51 - 12:58)
the second most popular legendary just (12:55 - 13:01)
based off Pokemon go is Rayquaza it like (12:58 - 13:03)
that also just drives PE like no one is (13:01 - 13:05)
running out to do red iice I'm sorry (13:03 - 13:08)
redice no one cares about you if there (13:05 - 13:10)
was a sevenstar red jice and Scarlet and (13:08 - 13:11)
violet people would be like skipping (13:10 - 13:15)
this week no one just no one it's not (13:11 - 13:17)
happening for you man you got to do it (13:15 - 13:19)
for the collection but yeah you're not (13:17 - 13:20)
you're not going to be repeating it I (13:19 - 13:22)
don't think and they've made people (13:20 - 13:26)
pretty tired of hoo and Lugia in go (13:22 - 13:28)
specifically do you think they' realized (13:26 - 13:30)
that though (13:28 - 13:33)
like I'm not sure when something are we (13:30 - 13:35)
not getting them again in like two weeks (13:33 - 13:38)
or something I feel like hoo and Lugia (13:35 - 13:42)
in in Pokemon go is like Groundhog Day (13:38 - 13:43)
it's like what what is happening right (13:42 - 13:46)
now what is getting always rely on it to (13:43 - 13:47)
come (13:46 - 13:52)
back um so yeah I guess like if it's not (13:47 - 13:56)
seven star Shiny Rayquaza I don't (13:52 - 13:58)
know I I I just don't think they're (13:56 - 13:59)
going to do like (13:58 - 14:02)
primarina or septile or it's going to be (13:59 - 14:05)
Captain Pikachu or whatever the Pikachu (14:02 - 14:07)
at the Captain's Hat's called yeah he's (14:05 - 14:08)
called he's called Captain Pikachu I (14:07 - 14:11)
would love that scarlet and violet (14:08 - 14:12)
they've had hat Pikachu's in games (14:11 - 14:15)
before yeah that would be cool too it's (14:12 - 14:17)
not in the game data so they would need (14:15 - 14:20)
an update for it but I I was thinking (14:17 - 14:23)
they could I was thinking uh like maybe (14:20 - 14:24)
they bring armored Mewtwo in or (14:23 - 14:26)
something like that and the same sort of (14:24 - 14:31)
it wouldn't tie into anything (14:26 - 14:31)
that was a Pokemon day thing where they (14:31 - 14:35)
introduced armored meww in Pokemon go (14:33 - 14:37)
and then they brought the clone (14:35 - 14:39)
Pokemon that was literally the Pokemon (14:37 - 14:43)
day before Pokemon Day 2020 yeah it was (14:39 - 14:48)
yeah that's why almost no one has it (14:43 - 14:48)
correct um yeah so I I think for the (14:50 - 14:55)
Seven Star raids currently they are (14:53 - 14:58)
going in order of um blazak kin was (14:55 - 15:00)
Crispen (14:58 - 15:04)
Pokemon andolon was amaris's Pokemon so (15:00 - 15:05)
technically next would be primarina but (15:04 - 15:07)
that would be on pause for whatever (15:05 - 15:09)
Pokemon day is and then after primarina (15:07 - 15:11)
would be the dragon septile because we (15:09 - 15:13)
all know septile is going to be dragon (15:11 - 15:15)
terot type uh and then who knows what (15:13 - 15:17)
they're going to do after that besides (15:15 - 15:20)
like the rest of the starters uh I I do (15:17 - 15:21)
think they're going in order but I don't (15:20 - 15:23)
think like they're going to celebrate (15:21 - 15:27)
Pokemon day with (15:23 - 15:27)
Superior that does seem unlike (15:27 - 15:31)
it really seems like they're tying (15:30 - 15:34)
everything into the anime yeah yeah I (15:31 - 15:35)
think I think that's their big thing (15:34 - 15:38)
this year um speaking of which seems (15:35 - 15:41)
like an odd thing sorry it seems like an (15:38 - 15:42)
odd thing that they're doing considering (15:41 - 15:44)
there's such a gap between Japan getting (15:42 - 15:47)
it and everybody else getting it yep (15:44 - 15:49)
yeah I know it's like that feels like (15:47 - 15:51)
something they would do once they got (15:49 - 15:53)
seoc cast going and they were like Hey (15:51 - 15:54)
we're going to celebrate the fact that (15:53 - 15:56)
you can all watch the anime all at the (15:54 - 15:58)
same time by giving you this bunch of (15:56 - 16:00)
anime related stuff but (15:58 - 16:04)
no uh unless like part of the anime is (16:00 - 16:07)
they're going to announce a movie (16:04 - 16:10)
for Japan because usually Japan gets the (16:07 - 16:13)
movie first and then we get it later and (16:10 - 16:15)
yeah because we haven't had one since (16:13 - 16:17)
was it 2019 oh we did have 2020 but they (16:15 - 16:20)
didn't get released in the normal way so (16:17 - 16:21)
there was that one there's that 2020 (16:20 - 16:24)
Pokemon T striking again yeah that was (16:21 - 16:27)
the zerude movie yep yeah yeah which we (16:24 - 16:30)
got eventually (16:27 - 16:34)
uh where where they they actually uh had (16:30 - 16:36)
a character spoiler for the hey it's (16:34 - 16:38)
been it's been five five four years for (16:36 - 16:40)
the zerun movie I'm G to spoil this for (16:38 - 16:43)
you the the the darkest Pokemon movie to (16:40 - 16:47)
date because they actually show a human (16:43 - 16:50)
character murder to other characters he (16:47 - 16:52)
drives them off the road and makes them (16:50 - 16:54)
crash their car that has never happened (16:52 - 16:57)
in a Pokemon movie then sometimes (16:54 - 17:00)
there's implied like we've hurt you from (16:57 - 17:04)
a character or like usually it's like (17:00 - 17:07)
the humans hurting the Pokemon in some (17:04 - 17:09)
way whether it's like chains or or or (17:07 - 17:11)
whatnot but it is never a human (17:09 - 17:13)
character hurting another human (17:11 - 17:15)
character to the point where like the (17:13 - 17:19)
kid is like my parents are gone forever (17:15 - 17:23)
like what a weird turn in that (17:19 - 17:26)
movie you can't even I I enjoyed it you (17:23 - 17:28)
can't even like be like oh there's a bit (17:26 - 17:30)
of ambiguity around it because like the (17:28 - 17:32)
whole point of this story is no your (17:30 - 17:35)
parents are dead this is how it happened (17:32 - 17:37)
yeah yeah there's no there's no like (17:35 - 17:38)
maybe this didn't (17:37 - 17:42)
[Laughter] (17:38 - 17:45)
happen just none of that it's just I was (17:42 - 17:47)
like my jaw was actually on the floor (17:45 - 17:49)
when they showed that scene I was like (17:47 - 17:52)
oh that's how this (17:49 - 17:54)
okay um hey that that's how Pokemon (17:52 - 17:55)
movies (17:54 - 17:58)
finished yeah they were like never again (17:55 - 17:59)
them the ultimate (17:58 - 18:03)
ending uh yeah I (17:59 - 18:05)
think I think the Pokemon movies overall (18:03 - 18:09)
were pretty successful at least in the (18:05 - 18:11)
the the East maybe not as much in the (18:09 - 18:14)
west but I don't know why they would (18:11 - 18:16)
just stop doing (18:14 - 18:19)
them well my question is (18:16 - 18:23)
where were were they planning to stop it (18:19 - 18:25)
like was that planned to be the last one (18:23 - 18:27)
they've made or did they have plans for (18:25 - 18:29)
other ones and then when Co La that one (18:27 - 18:32)
they just kind of gave up like do they (18:29 - 18:33)
have story boards for other films do (18:32 - 18:36)
they have half-made half animated ones (18:33 - 18:40)
don't know well the movies keep going (18:36 - 18:43)
with Ash or they keep going with the new (18:40 - 18:46)
characters well (18:43 - 18:48)
yeah I feel like they're probably I I (18:46 - 18:51)
feel like just because of the the so (18:48 - 18:53)
much focus on the anime I feel like if (18:51 - 18:55)
they're to show a movie it would be the (18:53 - 18:57)
new characters characters I feel like (18:55 - 18:59)
they're all that's how I'm feeling too I (18:57 - 19:00)
don't feel like they would be doing all (18:59 - 19:02)
of this promotion with all of the new (19:00 - 19:06)
anime and then go to a movie with Ash (19:02 - 19:08)
yeah no I think I think Ash is coming (19:06 - 19:11)
back whether that's in like a cameo or a (19:08 - 19:13)
movie but I feel like they they got to (19:11 - 19:15)
like they got to let it age a little bit (19:13 - 19:16)
got to let it uh what what is that (19:15 - 19:18)
called with (19:16 - 19:21)
wine it's it's aging that's what it's (19:18 - 19:25)
called yeah you have the word Steve okay (19:21 - 19:28)
okay got a little what about this the (19:25 - 19:29)
got a little Mar Mar a little bit longer (19:28 - 19:30)
there you (19:29 - 19:33)
go that's (19:30 - 19:35)
different perfect you got to age and (19:33 - 19:37)
marinade at the same (19:35 - 19:42)
time um okay so I think (19:37 - 19:44)
also I'm I'm sorry I'm I'm trying to tie (19:42 - 19:47)
everything together here uh that Captain (19:44 - 19:50)
Pikachu is for sure coming to Pokemon go (19:47 - 19:52)
for Pokemon day like that has kind of (19:50 - 19:55)
been spoiled at this point since it's (19:52 - 19:56)
any because Niantic likes to push their (19:55 - 19:58)
updates like two weeks in advance and (19:56 - 20:01)
then everyone just figures it (19:58 - 20:03)
out yeah but I think they have to do (20:01 - 20:05)
that because sometimes things get held (20:03 - 20:09)
up in the App Store so they have to like (20:05 - 20:11)
put it in early so it doesn't get (20:09 - 20:15)
approved or denied well kind of but I'm (20:11 - 20:18)
pretty sure this data is not tied to an (20:15 - 20:22)
app update it's your game downloading it (20:18 - 20:25)
from the server um but you still want to (20:22 - 20:27)
make sure that that's like everybody has (20:25 - 20:29)
it you don't want people hearing about (20:27 - 20:31)
the event and going on to log on and (20:29 - 20:32)
then your game takes ages to get it (20:31 - 20:34)
because it hasn't downloaded that update (20:32 - 20:36)
you wanted to have it at least a few (20:34 - 20:38)
days (20:36 - 20:38)
beforehand yeah so to summarize we (20:38 - 20:47)
have shiny breakway in unite suru Edge (20:43 - 20:50)
promotion happening right now in the TCG (20:47 - 20:53)
slthe little animated short and Captain (20:50 - 20:55)
Pikachu coming to (20:53 - 20:59)
go that's all anime tiin and yeah (20:55 - 21:00)
exactly they're going to they're going (20:59 - 21:02)
to talk about the (21:00 - 21:05)
anime it kind of now is maybe it's like (21:02 - 21:07)
making more sense why the anime was (21:05 - 21:09)
delayed two weeks because they wanted to (21:07 - 21:11)
maybe talk about all of it because I (21:09 - 21:13)
think originally it was supposed to come (21:11 - 21:15)
out on the (21:13 - 21:17)
23rd which is just four days before (21:15 - 21:19)
Pokemon day and now it's coming out on (21:17 - 21:23)
the 7th I think so it's coming out like (21:19 - 21:26)
a week after Pokemon (21:23 - 21:26)
day I wouldn't be surprised if the delay (21:27 - 21:33)
in the anime was just Netflix has (21:30 - 21:34)
something else it wants to get out that (21:33 - 21:36)
day and it doesn't want two groups of (21:34 - 21:39)
people all dealing with those things at (21:36 - 21:40)
once all getting on on the same day to (21:39 - 21:42)
watch stuff and also you got to spread (21:40 - 21:45)
out your big releases um so that you (21:42 - 21:47)
always have something exciting coming I (21:45 - 21:50)
would I don't I don't suspect it was (21:47 - 21:53)
changing anything or because of this (21:50 - 21:55)
because I feel like they would have tied (21:53 - 21:58)
it into it this way so it's there so (21:55 - 21:59)
that people can get it when you announce (21:58 - 22:00)
it right CU otherwise it's like oh yeah (21:59 - 22:02)
I hear all this stuff about the anime (22:00 - 22:06)
and in the US watch it in a week and a (22:02 - 22:08)
yeah exactly it sure is going to be (22:06 - 22:10)
interesting to see the Pokemon day (22:08 - 22:12)
announcements and say this is the anime (22:10 - 22:14)
all of you have access to it right now (22:12 - 22:15)
and you've seen it except for the people (22:14 - 22:17)
in the US who are gonna have it in (22:15 - 22:18)
another (22:17 - 22:20)
week good (22:18 - 22:23)
[Laughter] (22:20 - 22:26)
luck uh yeah I think it (22:23 - 22:29)
like since unite has come they've done (22:26 - 22:31)
something in (22:29 - 22:35)
unite um pretty much every year well oh (22:31 - 22:38)
yeah so I guess for for unite we know so (22:35 - 22:40)
there was the one year where they did (22:38 - 22:42)
hoopa and then I think it was last year (22:40 - 22:44)
they did (22:42 - 22:46)
zachian and then this year is going to (22:44 - 22:47)
be (22:46 - 22:50)
maridon probably because we know maridon (22:47 - 22:54)
is coming spoilers we also know suu Edge (22:50 - 22:57)
and that the suru Edge thing makes way (22:54 - 22:59)
more sense now we talked about this two (22:57 - 23:01)
week well last week but technically two (22:59 - 23:04)
weeks ago with Greg that like suru Edge (23:01 - 23:06)
is there and now that they're promoting (23:04 - 23:09)
suru Edge so hard I don't know if suru (23:06 - 23:10)
Edge is GNA like (23:09 - 23:13)
debut the same time as maridon or like (23:10 - 23:15)
two weeks after it'll debut at the same (23:13 - 23:18)
time as the anime in the there you go (23:15 - 23:19)
that's (23:18 - 23:22)
why um but now the well they could at (23:19 - 23:23)
least announce that cillage is coming (23:22 - 23:24)
they've done that before where they're (23:23 - 23:25)
like three characters coming here's the (23:24 - 23:29)
first one today yeah um but now the (23:25 - 23:31)
sural edge in in unite is making more (23:29 - 23:33)
sense as well but they haven't that's (23:31 - 23:35)
the one that didn't have any D any data (23:33 - 23:38)
for testing right (23:35 - 23:41)
yeah that would be pretty quick to roll (23:38 - 23:43)
it out then but we'll see I think they (23:41 - 23:45)
still announce it I think they still say (23:43 - 23:47)
it's (23:45 - 23:51)
coming here's here's a picture of (23:47 - 23:51)
it I do kind of wish they were doing (23:51 - 23:57)
both of them sured and armor Rouge I (23:53 - 23:59)
think those two go together well as a (23:57 - 24:02)
pair but they definitely got the most (23:59 - 24:03)
popular (24:02 - 24:07)
one yeah um all right I I've talked (24:03 - 24:08)
enough Al what do you think is coming (24:07 - 24:09)
for Pokemon (24:08 - 24:12)
day well you want think it's coming or (24:09 - 24:13)
well yeah because those are two (24:12 - 24:15)
different two very different things so (24:13 - 24:17)
I'm I'm gon to say a thing that lots of (24:15 - 24:20)
people will hate is I want a new game I (24:17 - 24:22)
want a new main season not not pro you (24:20 - 24:24)
know not like a a new like what we would (24:22 - 24:26)
call gen 10 or whatever but I want (24:24 - 24:30)
something um I I think it I mean (24:26 - 24:32)
personally what I want is another game (24:30 - 24:35)
with catching like Pokemon Legends I (24:32 - 24:38)
want something like that that I think is (24:35 - 24:40)
has by far been my favorite game uh of (24:38 - 24:42)
recent times and I think we need more of (24:40 - 24:45)
that I think that's fun uh will we get (24:42 - 24:46)
that probably (24:45 - 24:50)
not I think um the the the current (24:46 - 24:52)
expectations are that if we're getting a (24:50 - 24:54)
game it's probably going to be gen five (24:52 - 24:56)
remakes what I think would be fun if (24:54 - 24:58)
they did that because the question then (24:56 - 25:00)
is is or do you do black and white or do (24:58 - 25:02)
you do black and white two or do you do (25:00 - 25:05)
a black and white three a equel I say (25:02 - 25:06)
you do both black and white and black (25:05 - 25:08)
and white two into one game and you can (25:06 - 25:10)
play through them (25:08 - 25:14)
both they like money way too much to do (25:10 - 25:17)
that yeah but I don't think they would (25:14 - 25:19)
do that many remakes for (25:17 - 25:22)
them well they could do (25:19 - 25:26)
DLC yeah I guess but they don't seem to (25:22 - 25:30)
do DLC as much in the (25:26 - 25:34)
non they're still main series uh new (25:30 - 25:36)
brand new like I just want to remind (25:34 - 25:37)
everyone when they released brilliant (25:36 - 25:39)
Diamond shotting Pearl with none of the (25:37 - 25:42)
benefits of platinum just just to put (25:39 - 25:45)
that out there and hopefully they've (25:42 - 25:47)
learned their lesson you asked what I (25:45 - 25:48)
wanted Steve not what I thought was (25:47 - 25:50)
going to happen but it could I mean they (25:48 - 25:52)
could absolutely do that where they go (25:50 - 25:53)
here's black and white and then they (25:52 - 25:54)
announced after black and white they (25:53 - 25:56)
announced three months later oh and (25:54 - 25:57)
we're going to add black and white two (25:56 - 26:01)
onto to those games with a W with a DLC (25:57 - 26:03)
it kind of it stops it being oh we're (26:01 - 26:05)
just going to sell you both games (26:03 - 26:08)
because then that ends up being $120 if (26:05 - 26:12)
you want both of them um you know the 90 (26:08 - 26:13)
seems to be a lot more palatable for (26:12 - 26:16)
people especially if it's coming later (26:13 - 26:19)
on as well but I I can't see them I (26:16 - 26:21)
can't see them releasing both of them as (26:19 - 26:23)
remakes individually like that just (26:21 - 26:24)
seems (26:23 - 26:28)
like a bit much yeah I I think my I (26:24 - 26:30)
think my only push back is like black (26:28 - 26:33)
two white two are not Platinum emerald (26:30 - 26:36)
crystal they are they are completely new (26:33 - 26:38)
stories you there are you start on the (26:36 - 26:41)
whole other side of the map even when (26:38 - 26:43)
when you when you walk (26:41 - 26:46)
um (26:43 - 26:46)
so as much as I would like a black and (26:47 - 26:53)
white remake as well I think I think (26:50 - 26:56)
it's one I think it's a little too (26:53 - 27:00)
soon um to I think it's more complicated (26:56 - 27:03)
than people are just giving it credit (27:00 - 27:07)
for uh and what I mean by that is like I (27:03 - 27:09)
I think I think just like diamond and (27:07 - 27:12)
pearl it's easy to mess up like I I (27:09 - 27:15)
don't know if they I there's probably (27:12 - 27:16)
some people out there that like like the (27:15 - 27:19)
the the fact that diamond pearl is like (27:16 - 27:20)
a a faithful (27:19 - 27:23)
remake um (27:20 - 27:30)
but I I I I don't think (27:23 - 27:30)
I I don't think that like it's (27:32 - 27:37)
particularly fun like like here let me (27:35 - 27:39)
just lay out like the start of black and (27:37 - 27:40)
white and I've said this a lot this week (27:39 - 27:43)
on my twitch stream when you go when (27:40 - 27:47)
because black and white takes a lot of (27:43 - 27:49)
like um similarities to like the (27:47 - 27:52)
original red and blue where like the (27:49 - 27:54)
pedv is the Pidgey line The Rock and (27:52 - 27:56)
roller is the Geodude line the sock and (27:54 - 27:58)
thrower the hitmon Le hitmon CH which (27:56 - 27:59)
there's nothing wrong with that I I I (27:58 - 28:01)
don't I that's never had a problem with (27:59 - 28:03)
that I know some people did but like (28:01 - 28:04)
never had a problem with that when you (28:03 - 28:06)
start black and white just let me lay (28:04 - 28:08)
this out for you I remember it very well (28:06 - 28:11)
Route One your choices are pedv and (28:08 - 28:14)
perin that's it route two your choices (28:11 - 28:17)
are PV perin and Lily pup route three (28:14 - 28:22)
your choices are PV Lily pup uh uh what (28:17 - 28:26)
was the other one and like timle right (28:22 - 28:28)
like you have this very very old style (28:26 - 28:32)
of Pokemon game where like that's how (28:28 - 28:34)
that's how the first four were kind of (28:32 - 28:37)
built up well um like I guess like ruby (28:34 - 28:39)
and sapphire and diamond pearl at least (28:37 - 28:41)
had like here new Pokemon but also here (28:39 - 28:46)
are old Pokemon like it just feels so (28:41 - 28:48)
archaic um and when you're when you come (28:46 - 28:49)
from a game like scarlet and violet or (28:48 - 28:52)
sword and shield which is just like kind (28:49 - 28:54)
of well Scarlet Violet more so or here (28:52 - 28:57)
let's use Legends AR archus so when you (28:54 - 28:59)
come from like the Legends archus and (28:57 - 29:01)
Scarlet and violet and you go like here (28:59 - 29:03)
go anywhere catch (29:01 - 29:05)
anything again there's you can't really (29:03 - 29:06)
go anywhere in Legends there's five (29:05 - 29:09)
areas but you know what I mean to back (29:06 - 29:11)
to like okay here's the only route you (29:09 - 29:14)
have here's two Pokemon you can catch (29:11 - 29:17)
like it's ve it feels very slow now on (29:14 - 29:19)
top of that on top of that feeling very (29:17 - 29:22)
slow you you have the whole dream world (29:19 - 29:25)
and I would argue that the dream world (29:22 - 29:28)
was so ahead of its time for black and (29:25 - 29:30)
white where you you would like log into (29:28 - 29:34)
a website go into your 3DS say you're (29:30 - 29:38)
connecting to the thing so if we're (29:34 - 29:40)
getting black and white whether that's (29:38 - 29:42)
this year or next year or in five years (29:40 - 29:44)
right how are they going to do that (29:42 - 29:45)
because I don't think they can just like (29:44 - 29:48)
ignore that part of the game I think (29:45 - 29:50)
they have to either build a mobile app (29:48 - 29:52)
or a website and then somehow have (29:50 - 29:54)
maintenance who they probably put that (29:52 - 29:56)
on ilka like hey ilka you made Pokemon (29:54 - 30:00)
home now make a like a dream world site (29:56 - 30:03)
so I I do think as much as I would like (30:00 - 30:05)
black and white I do think one it's too (30:03 - 30:08)
soon there it took 15 years to remake (30:05 - 30:10)
Diamond and Pearl it was supposed you (30:08 - 30:11)
know it came out on the fif well it (30:10 - 30:14)
missed the 15th anniversary by like two (30:11 - 30:16)
months and for at least for black and (30:14 - 30:18)
white we're only on year this would be (30:16 - 30:21)
the 14th anniversary for Japan and it (30:18 - 30:23)
would be the 13th anniversary for the us (30:21 - 30:25)
because it came out six months later so (30:23 - 30:28)
we're not even up to 15 years for black (30:25 - 30:33)
white so it does seem a little soon I (30:28 - 30:36)
guess just a little bit possibly but not (30:33 - 30:39)
that soon yeah I don't think it doesn't (30:36 - 30:40)
sound like something it' be like oh I (30:39 - 30:42)
can't believe you're making this like (30:40 - 30:44)
it's so soon after it was released that (30:42 - 30:46)
I can't believe that you would be like (30:44 - 30:47)
it feels like a (30:46 - 30:50)
whole a whole different time (30:47 - 30:56)
ago Gen 5 like I think the Gen 6 being (30:50 - 30:58)
3D and and (30:56 - 31:01)
being coming out in 2013 like and and (30:58 - 31:03)
maybe this is a me thing but that it (31:01 - 31:07)
feels like it's the second era of (31:03 - 31:09)
Pokemon and it feels like everything (31:07 - 31:12)
before that was one era and then we went (31:09 - 31:15)
into boom this is the second era and (31:12 - 31:16)
this is pointless right it doesn't (31:15 - 31:18)
matter it's just a term it's just a (31:16 - 31:21)
thing but it I think if they were to (31:18 - 31:23)
remake X and (31:21 - 31:28)
Y that would feel absolutely wild like (31:23 - 31:30)
which Jack game just celebrated 10 years (31:28 - 31:32)
yeah exactly like I can't believe you (31:30 - 31:34)
would be doing this just now I don't (31:32 - 31:35)
think I would feel the same about Gen 5 (31:34 - 31:38)
because it feels like it doesn't just (31:35 - 31:40)
feel like a couple of years earlier than (31:38 - 31:45)
X and Y it feels like a lot more than (31:40 - 31:45)
that we also know that in the DLC with (31:46 - 31:54)
blueberry Academy they did pay homage to (31:50 - 31:58)
black and white quite a lot and I know (31:54 - 32:00)
that there are some people speculating (31:58 - 32:05)
that maybe we got that instead of (32:00 - 32:08)
remakes no I don't think (32:05 - 32:10)
that there there's no way they just (32:08 - 32:11)
don't remake black and white just (32:10 - 32:13)
because they love money well we know (32:11 - 32:16)
they have multiple teams going on in (32:13 - 32:18)
their company presumably the people who (32:16 - 32:22)
made Legends are the ones who have been (32:18 - 32:23)
working on whatever game is going to (32:22 - 32:25)
come out next unless the teams have (32:23 - 32:28)
shuffled up quite a bit (32:25 - 32:31)
um so they've had they've had a team (32:28 - 32:33)
that's made a game that we all like (32:31 - 32:36)
quite a lot that was a very new maybe (32:33 - 32:38)
not we all that many people liked quite (32:36 - 32:40)
a lot there was a very new style of game (32:38 - 32:42)
that we haven't seen before I guess what (32:40 - 32:45)
I'm going into this Pokemon day with is (32:42 - 32:48)
that if we see a new game I want it to (32:45 - 32:50)
be something new and surprising I've (32:48 - 32:53)
really enjoyed seeing let's go and (32:50 - 32:56)
legends come out and be totally new (32:53 - 32:58)
kinds of things (32:56 - 33:01)
that is a good point because I think (32:58 - 33:03)
we've had a few different ways of them (33:01 - 33:06)
doing remakes or however you want to (33:03 - 33:08)
call it right and they've all been (33:06 - 33:12)
bad I don't Legends was good well that's (33:08 - 33:15)
not I mean there the remixes (33:12 - 33:20)
remakes um so if you if you or was also (33:15 - 33:24)
good yeah so so it's okay so I feel like (33:20 - 33:26)
most in retrospect it's better than what (33:24 - 33:28)
we got better than BR dond shouting (33:26 - 33:30)
Pearl that's for (33:28 - 33:32)
sure but that is a good but like this is (33:30 - 33:34)
the thing right that was it feels like (33:32 - 33:37)
the the outlier in so much as like it (33:34 - 33:38)
wasn't trying to just do the exact same (33:37 - 33:41)
game again with modern quality of life (33:38 - 33:43)
improvements it was trying to do this is (33:41 - 33:46)
what we have as a Pokemon game let's map (33:43 - 33:49)
that game onto this right it it it felt (33:46 - 33:53)
like X and Y but in that world right it (33:49 - 33:55)
was it was a combining of those two (33:53 - 33:58)
things it wasn't just like here's your (33:55 - 34:00)
same style of Pokemon game that you had (33:58 - 34:03)
back then just with more modern (34:00 - 34:06)
graphics and then you got you go back to (34:03 - 34:07)
if we ignore lights go for just now (34:06 - 34:10)
because that's a whole complicated thing (34:07 - 34:13)
uh you they then went back to your more (34:10 - 34:17)
traditional this is just the same game (34:13 - 34:18)
but maybe with some quality of life (34:17 - 34:22)
improvements not in this case um but (34:18 - 34:24)
also with updated graphics and and then (34:22 - 34:26)
there's let's go which is a whole other (34:24 - 34:30)
thing which is trying to rethink that a (34:26 - 34:34)
little bit but still kind of stick to (34:30 - 34:37)
how the game worked but definitely with (34:34 - 34:39)
a lot of quality of life improvements (34:37 - 34:42)
and some some would say failed but some (34:39 - 34:44)
experiments with how you play the (34:42 - 34:47)
Pokemon game um you know we we don't (34:44 - 34:49)
need to debate whether those worked or (34:47 - 34:52)
whatever and then some people do (34:49 - 34:55)
consider Legends a remake of some kind I (34:52 - 34:57)
I mean I think it's it's not a remake (34:55 - 35:00)
make but I can see the the feeling of (34:57 - 35:05)
this is this is like taking those games (35:00 - 35:08)
having a different story and making it a (35:05 - 35:10)
completely new game and it's (35:08 - 35:11)
experimenting with things in the same (35:10 - 35:14)
way that let's go was but in a different (35:11 - 35:18)
way yeah no I it's still revisiting an (35:14 - 35:20)
old region it's not a remake in that (35:18 - 35:22)
term but if they just continue on and (35:20 - 35:25)
instead of doing direct remakes start to (35:22 - 35:26)
do (35:25 - 35:28)
revisits I think some people would be (35:26 - 35:30)
excited about that so that's my question (35:28 - 35:31)
like if they were doing a gen five (35:30 - 35:34)
remake which one would they do would I (35:31 - 35:35)
don't think they're going to do what (35:34 - 35:37)
they did with oras where they're going (35:35 - 35:38)
to go here (35:37 - 35:41)
is a gen five but like scarlet and (35:38 - 35:43)
violet right like I think that would be (35:41 - 35:45)
wild because that feels like way too (35:43 - 35:47)
much work to do for a remake for (35:45 - 35:50)
them but I also can't see them just (35:47 - 35:52)
doing brilliant diamond shine shining (35:50 - 35:53)
Peril again like it's just the same game (35:52 - 35:56)
just with different Graphics yeah I I (35:53 - 35:59)
think (35:56 - 36:01)
I I think people Overlook that let's go (35:59 - 36:06)
and legends are very similar games um I (36:01 - 36:07)
think they're I think they're both (36:06 - 36:09)
trying to accomplish the same thing I (36:07 - 36:10)
think they're they're both games that (36:09 - 36:12)
are focused more on catching than they (36:10 - 36:15)
are on battling uh I think they're games (36:12 - 36:17)
that are um neither of those games have (36:15 - 36:20)
breeding neither of those games have (36:17 - 36:22)
like a lot of the social features that (36:20 - 36:25)
do accompany Pokemon games um both of (36:22 - 36:27)
those games have mass release both of (36:25 - 36:30)
those games have a unique catching style (36:27 - 36:32)
both of those games revisit an old (36:30 - 36:34)
region and like retell the story (36:32 - 36:36)
slightly um even though like they both (36:34 - 36:39)
have very similar like points like let's (36:36 - 36:41)
go wanted to like remind you about the (36:39 - 36:44)
Cubone stuff and um Legends wanted to (36:41 - 36:47)
remind you about like the the Diago Pia (36:44 - 36:49)
gutina stuff like right they they both (36:47 - 36:52)
HTE on certain things so (36:49 - 36:55)
like I (36:52 - 36:55)
think I and I could go on and I could go (36:55 - 37:00)
on about how they're they're more (36:59 - 37:03)
similar than people think um but I don't (37:00 - 37:05)
know if you can do like a black and (37:03 - 37:09)
white version of that whatever that is (37:05 - 37:11)
without just also putting out remakes of (37:09 - 37:13)
black and white like I don't think you (37:11 - 37:16)
can go like here's a let's go legend (37:13 - 37:18)
style black and white which what (37:16 - 37:20)
whatever like whatever that is whatever (37:18 - 37:22)
that's named I'm cool like I'll take (37:20 - 37:24)
anything (37:22 - 37:27)
um but I I still think you have to put (37:24 - 37:29)
out here is just a remake of black and (37:27 - 37:31)
white because we know that Nostalgia (37:29 - 37:34)
sells very very well and what if what if (37:31 - 37:36)
they just ported it though would that (37:34 - 37:38)
that would do the same (37:36 - 37:40)
thing like if they literally went you (37:38 - 37:43)
can buy black and white on the switch oh (37:40 - 37:47)
I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm out I don't want (37:43 - 37:47)
that you're telling me a good way for (37:47 - 37:52)
them to do that you're telling me you (37:50 - 37:54)
wouldn't you wouldn't buy that no I (37:52 - 37:56)
would but (37:54 - 37:57)
like (37:56 - 38:00)
like look like gen 3 fans had it good (37:57 - 38:02)
like they they did get the best remake (38:00 - 38:06)
Gen 4 fans in shambles they get they (38:02 - 38:07)
they got the worst (38:06 - 38:10)
remake but they also got Legends they (38:07 - 38:13)
that's true they got Legends (38:10 - 38:16)
um we (38:13 - 38:16)
all I I still think like even even in (38:17 - 38:24)
the development side of thing things I (38:22 - 38:27)
still think it's like too soon (38:24 - 38:30)
um like Legends is only two years old so (38:27 - 38:34)
if if if normally how this works yeah (38:30 - 38:36)
Legends just hit two (38:34 - 38:41)
years yes but it came not I mean I guess (38:36 - 38:43)
it there were a few years before that (38:41 - 38:45)
after let's go but if you're comparing (38:43 - 38:47)
let's go to Legends and thinking of (38:45 - 38:49)
those as sequential games that was way (38:47 - 38:52)
more than three (38:49 - 38:52)
years wait between what and what (38:54 - 39:02)
let's go in Legends it's (38:58 - 39:02)
2024 so that means Legends came out in (39:02 - 39:09)
202 yeah and that was 2018 201 yeah that (39:05 - 39:11)
was 2018 it's it's basic if if you (39:09 - 39:13)
assume that Legends was delayed by two (39:11 - 39:15)
months it's exactly three (39:13 - 39:17)
years yeah so it's only been two years (39:15 - 39:19)
for Legends that's a whole year of (39:17 - 39:20)
development just no no yeah but the (39:19 - 39:21)
game's not coming out now the game's (39:20 - 39:24)
coming out at the end of the year oh (39:21 - 39:25)
sure yeah I guess they don't release (39:24 - 39:27)
they don't Rel they don't announce a (39:25 - 39:29)
game on February coming out in (39:27 - 39:33)
March you never know the the March would (39:29 - 39:34)
be (39:33 - 39:36)
the is March some anniversary of black (39:34 - 39:39)
and white no way they would do that no I (39:36 - 39:43)
don't I don't think so either but like (39:39 - 39:47)
uh but if you have if you have the so (39:43 - 39:51)
normally it would be that the main team (39:47 - 39:54)
goes from generation to generation so (39:51 - 39:57)
when we're done with Gen 7 we start gen (39:54 - 39:58)
8 they said this they they have said (39:57 - 39:59)
this in (39:58 - 40:02)
multiple articles and interviews when (39:59 - 40:04)
we're done with Gen 8 we started on gen (40:02 - 40:07)
9 so we're done with Gen nine that main (40:04 - 40:10)
team is now working on gen 10 which that (40:07 - 40:12)
ain't coming out we we can all safely (40:10 - 40:14)
say that gen 10 ain't coming out anytime (40:12 - 40:17)
soon and then hopefully we can safely (40:14 - 40:20)
say that and so if the main team is (40:17 - 40:24)
working on gen (40:20 - 40:26)
10 then the side team would have been (40:24 - 40:28)
working on the deal (40:26 - 40:28)
which just finished coming out cuz who (40:29 - 40:33)
else is working on the side team has (40:31 - 40:34)
always worked on the DLC they've said (40:33 - 40:38)
that too I don't think the main team of (40:34 - 40:40)
scarlet the main team of sword and (40:38 - 40:41)
shield did not work on the DLC that was (40:40 - 40:44)
a completely omori was not in charge of (40:41 - 40:45)
any of that that was a completely (40:44 - 40:46)
different team (40:45 - 40:48)
okay okay I mean I feel like you're (40:46 - 40:50)
ignoring (40:48 - 40:56)
Ela well do Legends no like I don't like (40:50 - 40:58)
you can say you should be ignoring it (40:56 - 41:01)
but I don't think they'll just go oh (40:58 - 41:03)
brilliant of diamond and Shining Peril (41:01 - 41:06)
wasn't dealt with well let's just never (41:03 - 41:09)
do anything with AA again no how these (41:06 - 41:11)
things (41:09 - 41:11)
work um hopefully if Ila does another (41:11 - 41:16)
game they give them a little more time (41:15 - 41:18)
to do (41:16 - 41:21)
it yeah so what when was the decision (41:18 - 41:23)
made of like Ila is now in charge of (41:21 - 41:24)
bdsp and we need to get this out to (41:23 - 41:27)
celebrate the 15th anniversary (41:24 - 41:29)
and from everything I've heard from (41:27 - 41:30)
people who are close to the Pokemon (41:29 - 41:33)
company and people who have been around (41:30 - 41:35)
the Pokemon company is that that (41:33 - 41:38)
schedule got messed up that bdsp was (41:35 - 41:41)
supposed to come out in September on the (41:38 - 41:44)
15th anniversary exactly to celebrate (41:41 - 41:45)
and then Legends was supposed to come (41:44 - 41:47)
out in November and if when they just (41:45 - 41:50)
released sales numbers and you can see (41:47 - 41:53)
that bdsp sold more than Legends which (41:50 - 41:56)
is mindblowing because everyone agreed (41:53 - 41:59)
that bdsp was bad compared to Legends (41:56 - 42:02)
two games versus one but and there was (41:59 - 42:03)
two games versus one but the mo most (42:02 - 42:06)
important the most important part is (42:03 - 42:08)
Legends missed Christmas that's the most (42:06 - 42:11)
important part and if I was a kid or (42:08 - 42:13)
even if I wasn't a kid if I was you know (42:11 - 42:16)
well I guess 15y old 16 14y old still (42:13 - 42:19)
kid if if even if I'm a kid I'm not (42:16 - 42:21)
getting a game unless it's my birthday (42:19 - 42:24)
or unless it's (42:21 - 42:24)
Christmas fair (42:25 - 42:30)
enough yeah and and I I think I think (42:27 - 42:33)
Legends missing Christmas is a huge part (42:30 - 42:36)
of why it's didn't didn't out sell (42:33 - 42:38)
bdsp yeah because there was the huge (42:36 - 42:40)
online wave of everyone being super (42:38 - 42:43)
happy with it it got all of the good (42:40 - 42:47)
online hype that one could ever the main (42:43 - 42:48)
complaint about Legends was it was ugly (42:47 - 42:49)
that was that was literally the main (42:48 - 42:53)
complaint and it (42:49 - 42:55)
wasn't look that game had three colors a (42:53 - 42:57)
beautiful game (42:55 - 43:00)
game it was very intentional a color (42:57 - 43:03)
palette I I I I will go to my death With (43:00 - 43:06)
saying that game looked good um I I I (43:03 - 43:09)
can't see them doing that again I can't (43:06 - 43:11)
see them going two games two sets of (43:09 - 43:13)
games however you want to define a set (43:11 - 43:16)
right two different things I can't see (43:13 - 43:17)
them doing that in that sort of time (43:16 - 43:21)
frame again like that just feels like to (43:17 - 43:25)
too much to deal with marketing wise (43:21 - 43:27)
like I don't think when they're still (43:25 - 43:30)
riding scarlet and violet yeah yeah I I (43:27 - 43:32)
I don't think that it would I think your (43:30 - 43:34)
the Christmas point is a very good point (43:32 - 43:37)
but had they released the two months (43:34 - 43:40)
earlier that they were meant to I feel (43:37 - 43:43)
like Legends is still selling (43:40 - 43:46)
less a very small amount of that is (43:43 - 43:47)
going to be because it's two games I (43:46 - 43:49)
don't think the number is huge yeah (43:47 - 43:53)
we'll never we likely never know (43:49 - 43:55)
um but I think that what people do is (43:53 - 43:57)
they go oh there's a new Pokémon game (43:55 - 43:59)
will buy that Pokémon game and then (43:57 - 44:00)
another one comes out two months later (43:59 - 44:02)
and they go no I'm not buying another (44:00 - 44:04)
Pokémon game for my kid right they just (44:02 - 44:06)
got (44:04 - 44:09)
one yeah when they are full-sized fully (44:06 - 44:13)
priced games that's something that also (44:09 - 44:15)
makes sense I (44:13 - 44:18)
think go ahead Anna they clearly want to (44:15 - 44:21)
go in New Directions there they're doing (44:18 - 44:23)
new things but the problem is that they (44:21 - 44:25)
also have an entire fan base that (44:23 - 44:27)
expects remake (44:25 - 44:28)
not (44:27 - 44:32)
revisits and I think they're that uh (44:28 - 44:33)
Legends and Brilliant Diamond shining (44:32 - 44:35)
Pearl was kind of the point where they (44:33 - 44:38)
were caught between that that they (44:35 - 44:40)
wanted to do something new but they (44:38 - 44:42)
still had to appeal to the fan base that (44:40 - 44:46)
wanted the the very much faithful remake (44:42 - 44:48)
and that's why you dump it on (44:46 - 44:51)
ilka I hate to say this but I think it (44:48 - 44:55)
is more likely for us to get a third DLC (44:51 - 44:59)
for scarlet Violet instead of us getting (44:55 - 45:02)
black and white this year and I don't (44:59 - 45:03)
want that if you've listened to this (45:02 - 45:05)
podcast for any amount of time I don't (45:03 - 45:09)
want that it also doesn't seem likely at (45:05 - 45:12)
all no no (45:09 - 45:16)
I I mean I so so here's here's my my my (45:12 - 45:18)
other thing that I've been thinking (45:16 - 45:21)
about I I mentioned this in just as a (45:18 - 45:24)
black and white 3 right but they (45:21 - 45:27)
absolutely could do a black and white 3 (45:24 - 45:28)
right that's a s of thing they could do (45:27 - 45:31)
and they could do that however they want (45:28 - 45:34)
now granted that doesn't give you the oh (45:31 - 45:36)
it's a remake crowd doesn't make them (45:34 - 45:38)
happy right but if you make it a black (45:36 - 45:41)
and white 3 it doesn't you don't compare (45:38 - 45:42)
it to black and white one and two (45:41 - 45:44)
because you're not going oh it doesn't (45:42 - 45:45)
have this thing it doesn't have that (45:44 - 45:46)
thing you don't have to have the or (45:45 - 45:48)
should it be fit you can do it how you (45:46 - 45:50)
want to do it in (45:48 - 45:52)
2024 or (45:50 - 45:54)
2025 (45:52 - 45:57)
um and I think you still get some of (45:54 - 46:02)
that Goodwill of its a gen five (45:57 - 46:06)
game if they were doing black and (46:02 - 46:08)
white and if they were doing a black and (46:06 - 46:10)
white three I don't I wouldn't expect it (46:08 - 46:13)
for another stretch of time because (46:10 - 46:15)
that's that's a whole different kind of (46:13 - 46:17)
game where you have to plan out an (46:15 - 46:20)
entirely new (46:17 - 46:23)
storyline which Legends did have but it (46:20 - 46:24)
was a shorter (46:23 - 46:27)
storyline but B in mind those are (46:24 - 46:28)
different that's not the same as (46:27 - 46:31)
development time right they leg is also (46:28 - 46:33)
a really small game like the thing about (46:31 - 46:35)
let's go and legends is they're both (46:33 - 46:37)
really tiny games compared to scarlet (46:35 - 46:40)
and violet and sword and shield they're (46:37 - 46:42)
they're they're very (46:40 - 46:44)
tiny I mean there's a lot of (46:42 - 46:45)
replayability there don't get (46:44 - 46:47)
replayability confused with like from (46:45 - 46:51)
start to finish yeah but I I I guess my (46:47 - 46:54)
point is like you don't writing a story (46:51 - 46:56)
is not the thing that takes takes time (46:54 - 46:59)
in a game in game development that's (46:56 - 47:02)
fair um you know in a year you could (46:59 - 47:04)
easily if if you're a good writer and (47:02 - 47:06)
that's obviously a big thing and if you (47:04 - 47:09)
don't end up with other issues you could (47:06 - 47:11)
write multiple game stories in a in a (47:09 - 47:14)
year like I don't think going oh and (47:11 - 47:17)
there and as we've discussed before they (47:14 - 47:20)
have they've decided this like years ago (47:17 - 47:22)
like what we are talking about now and (47:20 - 47:24)
what happens this year was already (47:22 - 47:27)
decided years ago sure sure they're not (47:24 - 47:29)
they're not making these decisions today (47:27 - 47:30)
they didn't make these decisions last (47:29 - 47:32)
year they didn't make them the year (47:30 - 47:33)
before they probably made them before (47:32 - 47:35)
brilliant Diamond shining par came out (47:33 - 47:37)
you know yeah but that's also why I I (47:35 - 47:38)
guess I didn't say this I don't think (47:37 - 47:41)
there will be a game this year I think (47:38 - 47:43)
that if I think if you look at all the (47:41 - 47:45)
Pokemon days which I spent four hours (47:43 - 47:48)
doing that there are a lot of Duds in (47:45 - 47:49)
Pokemon days and some people will be (47:48 - 47:51)
like oh what what about the year they (47:49 - 47:53)
announced the DLC for sword and shield (47:51 - 47:55)
they didn't do that during Pokemon day (47:53 - 47:57)
what about the year they announced Let's (47:55 - 47:58)
Go Pikachu let's go eeve they also (47:57 - 48:01)
didn't do that during Pokemon day um (47:58 - 48:04)
like if we're taking in consideration (48:01 - 48:06)
that all like they have their they have (48:04 - 48:07)
like a 10year schedule or whatever (48:06 - 48:09)
planned out for all their games which (48:07 - 48:11)
I'm sure they do that would be insane if (48:09 - 48:12)
they didn't if they don't know what's (48:11 - 48:14)
coming down 10 years of line we also (48:12 - 48:16)
have to take in consideration that (48:14 - 48:20)
scarlet and violet and legends and bdsp (48:16 - 48:22)
were all (48:20 - 48:27)
still being made when Co happened and (48:22 - 48:29)
everyone had to move to work at home so (48:27 - 48:33)
if anything there's like now they're (48:29 - 48:35)
probably finally getting back on (48:33 - 48:38)
schedule and back up to date so this (48:35 - 48:41)
would be the year that they could (48:38 - 48:43)
probably get away with skipping (48:41 - 48:45)
something which I think is fine because (48:43 - 48:48)
you you can't be a Pokemon fan and be (48:45 - 48:50)
like man Scarlett and violet was so (48:48 - 48:52)
rushed it's so buggy I keep falling (48:50 - 48:54)
through the floor and then be like why (48:52 - 48:55)
is there not a game this year like you (48:54 - 48:58)
can't have have both like you could say (48:55 - 49:00)
both but (48:58 - 49:02)
like so I I think I think you're (49:00 - 49:05)
conflating two things slightly so one is (49:02 - 49:07)
yeah you're right if even if something (49:05 - 49:08)
comes out this year it doesn't mean (49:07 - 49:09)
they're going to announce it on Pokemon (49:08 - 49:12)
d right they have announced things not (49:09 - 49:15)
on Pokemon d but (49:12 - 49:18)
sometimes both those (49:15 - 49:21)
cases um both of those cases they still (49:18 - 49:23)
released something that year we haven't (49:21 - 49:26)
it's been close to a decade since we (49:23 - 49:28)
haven't had something main series (49:26 - 49:31)
releasing in Pokemon and I think this is (49:28 - 49:33)
the year they (49:31 - 49:36)
skip I mean they could I just I just (49:33 - 49:38)
don't see it happening like I think (49:36 - 49:41)
they've gotten into this rhythm of we're (49:38 - 49:43)
going to have a big release every year (49:41 - 49:45)
and sometimes that's DLC sometimes (49:43 - 49:47)
that's remakes sometimes that's brand (49:45 - 49:50)
new games but it's I I think I don't (49:47 - 49:52)
think it's coincidence that it's been (49:50 - 49:55)
nearly 10 years there wasn't a 10e gap (49:52 - 49:59)
between any of the the the other gaps (49:55 - 50:00)
and it's not like a pattern thing I'm (49:59 - 50:03)
not trying to do a pattern thing right I (50:00 - 50:05)
I just think that that's what they like (50:03 - 50:09)
to do I also think they don't have to do (50:05 - 50:11)
a main Series game they can do a pretty (50:09 - 50:13)
big spin-off and that could be something (50:11 - 50:14)
new right that doesn't have to be a Pok (50:13 - 50:16)
in or a snap or a mystery dungeon that (50:14 - 50:21)
could be something like a like a Pikachu (50:16 - 50:23)
cart racer right like that could be like (50:21 - 50:28)
anything Pokemon Dash to no not (50:23 - 50:31)
bad the problem is that even even the (50:28 - 50:34)
biggest M uh side games spin-off games (50:31 - 50:37)
don't sell anywhere near the main Series (50:34 - 50:40)
games um but the I mean the interesting (50:37 - 50:42)
thing about side games is that they (50:40 - 50:43)
they've done a lot fewer of them (50:42 - 50:45)
recently as well and maybe that's Co (50:43 - 50:48)
like we we only got detective Pikachu (50:45 - 50:54)
last year um I can't remember that yeah (50:48 - 50:55)
and like we've basically been the last (50:54 - 50:59)
few years we've got one (50:55 - 51:01)
non-mobile spin-off game because (50:59 - 51:02)
obviously there's the there's unite and (51:01 - 51:05)
there's unite sleep go Masters Cafe (51:02 - 51:08)
remix can't forget about Cafe (51:05 - 51:11)
remix so I but even (51:08 - 51:14)
like yeah they don't they just don't (51:11 - 51:17)
sell as much like at all like the the (51:14 - 51:21)
best selling side game has was Pokemon (51:17 - 51:24)
pinball at 5 million so you're saying Al (51:21 - 51:27)
I understand I'm following Pokemon (51:24 - 51:31)
pinball later this year okay and and the (51:27 - 51:34)
worst selling if we ignore the Virtual (51:31 - 51:36)
Console releases of of the games the (51:34 - 51:39)
worst selling main Series game was (51:36 - 51:41)
Pokemon Crystal at 6 million so the (51:39 - 51:44)
worst selling main Series game outsold (51:41 - 51:47)
the bestselling side game yeah yeah yeah (51:44 - 51:50)
yeah that no you're you're right on that (51:47 - 51:52)
I just think if if there I if you know (51:50 - 51:54)
Nintendo came out and they said we're (51:52 - 51:56)
listening we've heard you we've heard (51:54 - 51:57)
the complaints right like that was a (51:56 - 52:01)
real thing they said and uh you know (51:57 - 52:04)
apparently Mr Joe sby and other people (52:01 - 52:07)
close to Pokemon have said like no game (52:04 - 52:09)
freak has understood that they messed up (52:07 - 52:11)
with scarlet and violet right maybe not (52:09 - 52:13)
messed up but they've heard the (52:11 - 52:15)
complaints I just think when you take (52:13 - 52:18)
all that in (52:15 - 52:20)
consideration at a certain point they (52:18 - 52:22)
have to skip a year and maybe it's this (52:20 - 52:24)
year maybe it's next year because (52:22 - 52:26)
they're not going to skip 20 6 because (52:24 - 52:29)
26 is their 30th Anniversary right yeah (52:26 - 52:31)
so we're on 24 next year would be 25 26 (52:29 - 52:33)
would be (52:31 - 52:33)
30 like I'm just when I when I think (52:34 - 52:40)
30th Anniversary which is (52:37 - 52:40)
2026 something I feel like has to give (52:41 - 52:47)
between now and then to make sure that (52:44 - 52:49)
they're not behind for their 30th (52:47 - 52:51)
anniversary and I feel like this would (52:49 - 52:53)
be the year they would be a little bit (52:51 - 52:56)
lighter I'm totally okay with a black (52:53 - 52:58)
and white game a Gen 2 game heck give me (52:56 - 53:00)
remakes of gen 7 whatever you want to do (52:58 - 53:04)
this year I'm okay with that I am just (53:00 - 53:07)
setting expectations that I feel like if (53:04 - 53:09)
there's going to be a lighter (53:07 - 53:13)
year this one kind of makes sense one (53:09 - 53:15)
other element that I may throw out there (53:13 - 53:17)
that would make a lighter year make (53:15 - 53:20)
sense is all of the increasing rumors (53:17 - 53:23)
saying that a switch uh sequel like the (53:20 - 53:26)
next console is going to potentially (53:23 - 53:27)
happen this year and I know those have (53:26 - 53:29)
been hen those rumors have been going on (53:27 - 53:31)
for the last five years look if I keep (53:29 - 53:33)
saying Gen 6 remakes I will eventually (53:31 - 53:36)
be right but it's starting to feel a (53:33 - 53:38)
little more concrete this year and I (53:36 - 53:40)
feel like that would make skipping this (53:38 - 53:42)
year in main series Pokemon games make (53:40 - 53:45)
sense yeah I don't think Pokemon have (53:42 - 53:48)
ever cared about that like you're the (53:45 - 53:49)
one who wanted Pokemon (53:48 - 53:52)
Z I guess that wasn't Z that was Stars (53:49 - 53:55)
wasn't it um got timeline mixed up there (53:52 - 53:57)
right rumors rumors and what they (53:55 - 53:58)
actually do are completely different (53:57 - 54:01)
right like it's just they've the switch (53:58 - 54:03)
they started looking like they might (54:01 - 54:04)
care and that's when they eventually (54:03 - 54:07)
they came out with let's go 18 months (54:04 - 54:09)
after the switch came out and that was (54:07 - 54:11)
the fastest they've done a new console (54:09 - 54:14)
right like it was like black and white (54:11 - 54:16)
were after the 3DS came out never mind (54:14 - 54:18)
Black and White 2 like it just they've (54:16 - 54:20)
never really gone we must be on the new (54:18 - 54:21)
no I think black and white was still (54:20 - 54:23)
before 3DS Black and White 2 was (54:21 - 54:25)
definitely after 3DS came out though I (54:23 - 54:28)
was it cuz I got I got 3DS on launch day (54:25 - 54:31)
and because I was poor I had to sell my (54:28 - 54:35)
DS I had to do the trade in and uh this (54:31 - 54:38)
this is a this is a Japanese release (54:35 - 54:41)
date versus not Japanese release dat had (54:38 - 54:46)
the DS I xl for Black 2 White 2 and that (54:41 - 54:47)
was brand (54:46 - 54:50)
new I I I think we still get one more (54:47 - 54:53)
Pokemon game on switch before switch 2 I (54:50 - 54:55)
just think there are too many switch is (54:53 - 54:57)
out there to ignore that your your (54:55 - 55:00)
player base is so (54:57 - 55:05)
big um but uh let's take a (55:00 - 55:07)
break because I I have to go to the (55:05 - 55:10)
bathroom and then we'll do we'll do a (55:07 - 55:12)
short segment of maybe like other things (55:10 - 55:14)
of Pokemon day that isn't main series (55:12 - 55:15)
because we could we could talk in (55:14 - 55:18)
circles for this um but there's a couple (55:15 - 55:20)
other things they could be announcing so (55:18 - 55:22)
we'll take a quick break and we will be (55:20 - 55:26)
right back and we are back from our (55:22 - 55:30)
Break um all right well we we asked Al (55:26 - 55:32)
what they wanted they said black and (55:30 - 55:33)
white and then we went on a 30-minute (55:32 - 55:35)
tangent about whether that's happening (55:33 - 55:37)
or not um which is cool like if it (55:35 - 55:40)
happens cool if it doesn't Hannah what (55:37 - 55:41)
would you (55:40 - 55:44)
like I kind of set it in there I want (55:41 - 55:46)
something new I want something a little (55:44 - 55:48)
surprising I want something that is out (55:46 - 55:51)
of left field that we haven't seen (55:48 - 55:54)
before not necessarily saying I will (55:51 - 55:57)
like it for sure if that happens but I (55:54 - 56:01)
was surprised by let's go and I was fine (55:57 - 56:03)
I was surprised by Legends and I really (56:01 - 56:04)
enjoyed (56:03 - 56:07)
it I have much stronger feelings about (56:04 - 56:09)
what I don't want this year than I have (56:07 - 56:12)
feelings about what I do want this year (56:09 - 56:14)
I know that I don't want gen (56:12 - 56:18)
10 because that would be ridiculous I (56:14 - 56:21)
know that I wasn't a big fan of let's go (56:18 - 56:26)
so jto let's go good is (56:21 - 56:29)
not not what I'm looking forward to I I (56:26 - 56:31)
don't think if they did that it would be (56:29 - 56:33)
the same anyway so I my question (56:31 - 56:36)
whenever people say oh you know what (56:33 - 56:38)
would they make a new let's go game is (56:36 - 56:40)
my question is what is a let's go game (56:38 - 56:42)
like if you mean doing exactly the same (56:40 - 56:45)
that they did with Pikachu and Eevee but (56:42 - 56:49)
with the jotto story and region instead (56:45 - 56:50)
then no I don't think they're I don't (56:49 - 56:52)
think they ever do that like they don't (56:50 - 56:54)
they don't do that they're never going (56:52 - 56:56)
to use the words let's go again that (56:54 - 56:58)
hands down that too they're not going to (56:56 - 56:59)
do (56:58 - 57:01)
that but no that's a good question Al is (56:59 - 57:03)
when people say like let's go Johto or (57:01 - 57:05)
even there was let's go CNO that was (57:03 - 57:07)
like a thing that happened for what like (57:05 - 57:11)
a year and a half like when you say that (57:07 - 57:13)
what what are you wanting because (57:11 - 57:15)
sometimes people will say like oh I just (57:13 - 57:18)
want that style but no catching mechanic (57:15 - 57:20)
and to me it's like that is that is that (57:18 - 57:24)
game yeah the the catching mechanic is (57:20 - 57:26)
that game (57:24 - 57:27)
and I also don't think they would do (57:26 - 57:29)
that catching mechanic again I think the (57:27 - 57:32)
Legends catching is what they were (57:29 - 57:34)
working towards and I can't see them (57:32 - 57:36)
going back to what lets go (57:34 - 57:39)
did yeah no I completely agree I feel (57:36 - 57:42)
like lets go had a time in a place that (57:39 - 57:44)
was when Pokemon go was a new thing and (57:42 - 57:46)
they were definitely jumping off of that (57:44 - 57:50)
merging it into the main Series games (57:46 - 57:52)
and I don't think that's coming back I (57:50 - 57:54)
think that was like just good marketing (57:52 - 57:57)
too like whether or not it worked I (57:54 - 58:00)
think like slightly tying the name to (57:57 - 58:03)
Pokémon go like it is a catchy name it's (58:00 - 58:06)
cute uh it it has the tie in you want (58:03 - 58:08)
but yeah I don't I don't think I don't (58:06 - 58:11)
think they repeat that name um I think (58:08 - 58:13)
it worked it's the best it's the the (58:11 - 58:15)
best or second best depending on exactly (58:13 - 58:18)
what numbers you use remake if you count (58:15 - 58:20)
it as a remake yeah in the Pokemon go (58:18 - 58:22)
groups I have that was definitely one of (58:20 - 58:25)
the most played main Series games (58:22 - 58:27)
amongst the go players that I know the (58:25 - 58:30)
serious go players that I know I think (58:27 - 58:33)
the the only thing that makes or I would (58:30 - 58:34)
I would have liked to see in that game (58:33 - 58:37)
is Just traditional controls that's (58:34 - 58:41)
it like even if you have to get past the (58:37 - 58:43)
first gym to turn it on or whatever you (58:41 - 58:45)
can technically have TR traditional (58:43 - 58:48)
controls if you play on a switch light (58:45 - 58:50)
technically I think that was my problem (58:48 - 58:53)
is that they had the functionality they (58:50 - 58:55)
just you couldn't use a Pro Controller (58:53 - 58:57)
and you couldn't turn it off if you were (58:55 - 59:00)
playing on the TV it just it feels like (58:57 - 59:02)
they were so close to being having that (59:00 - 59:04)
and that's an accessibility issue you (59:02 - 59:06)
know and it's like I really annoying (59:04 - 59:08)
that you have that ability and you have (59:06 - 59:09)
that functionality and you've just (59:08 - 59:11)
disabled it for certain (59:09 - 59:13)
controllers yeah I remember the first (59:11 - 59:15)
time uh this is a side tangent I (59:13 - 59:17)
remember the first time I really thought (59:15 - 59:19)
about accessibility in Pokemon uh which (59:17 - 59:21)
I think Pokemon is really bad I think (59:19 - 59:23)
Nintendo in general is really bad at (59:21 - 59:26)
accessibility um but uh the first time I (59:23 - 59:28)
really thought about it was in Ultra Sun (59:26 - 59:31)
Ultra Moon and I was talking to players (59:28 - 59:34)
who struggled with the ultra Wormhole (59:31 - 59:36)
stuff because it was it was dexterity (59:34 - 59:40)
based and it was motion control and I (59:36 - 59:44)
play a lot of games um so like to me (59:40 - 59:46)
that wasn't a problem but I think (59:44 - 59:49)
sometimes people Overlook that Pokemon (59:46 - 59:53)
is really convenient for people who play (59:49 - 59:56)
slower don't have super super fast (59:53 - 59:59)
reflexes um you can like think about a (59:56 - 60:00)
lot of things because not a lot of (59:59 - 60:03)
things in Pokemon are action-based and (60:00 - 60:04)
what's funny is I'm saying all that and (60:03 - 60:05)
you can apply that to pretty much people (60:04 - 60:07)
who didn't like Legends archus because (60:05 - 60:10)
it is an action RPG and that's totally (60:07 - 60:13)
okay um uh but that was that was what (60:10 - 60:15)
that game was (60:13 - 60:18)
clearly advertised as right like you (60:15 - 60:19)
look at that game and go I'm going to (60:18 - 60:21)
play that if you have those issues the (60:19 - 60:23)
the ultra Wormhole issue thing was like (60:21 - 60:25)
that was like here's a random thing in (60:23 - 60:28)
the middle that suddenly requires real (60:25 - 60:32)
time dexterity to get through the story (60:28 - 60:33)
that was the weird thing about that and (60:32 - 60:35)
you can turn off the motion control but (60:33 - 60:38)
after the first after the first you (60:35 - 60:39)
couldn't do it and the the one that (60:38 - 60:41)
mattered the one that you had to do to (60:39 - 60:42)
get through the story you couldn't turn (60:41 - 60:46)
it off for that one um so yeah I I think (60:42 - 60:48)
the that's the one thing that bothered (60:46 - 60:50)
me about let's go was the forced motion (60:48 - 60:51)
control and I think if that game just (60:50 - 60:53)
lets you use a Pro Controller again even (60:51 - 60:55)
if it was after like the the catching (60:53 - 60:57)
tutorial or after like the first gym you (60:55 - 61:00)
could like turn that on I for me like I (60:57 - 61:03)
love let's go in like 10 more years when (61:00 - 61:05)
I'm like oh I want to go back to let's (61:03 - 61:06)
go like I don't know if I want to pull (61:05 - 61:11)
out a Pokeball plus to like (61:06 - 61:13)
throw anyway side tangent I don't think (61:11 - 61:14)
let's go (61:13 - 61:17)
Johto like that's not saying I don't see (61:14 - 61:19)
a jotto remake in the future I just (61:17 - 61:21)
don't think they ever use the words (61:19 - 61:26)
let's go again no yeah no uh (61:21 - 61:29)
I mean and some people have said maybe a (61:26 - 61:33)
Legends style historical jto (61:29 - 61:37)
game which I amongst the legend style (61:33 - 61:40)
games people have suggested I would (61:37 - 61:42)
actually be okay with that one I would (61:40 - 61:46)
personally be terrified of a Legends uh (61:42 - 61:49)
Unova don't want them to do that nope (61:46 - 61:52)
but legends jto I could see working out (61:49 - 61:55)
but again I feel like that's the team (61:52 - 61:56)
that's trying new things so I don't (61:55 - 61:59)
really expect it to happen can I push (61:56 - 62:02)
back on the legend jotto real quick oh (61:59 - 62:06)
yeah I feel like they've told all those (62:02 - 62:10)
stories like the the the i in my head a (62:06 - 62:11)
a Legends which I don't think they use (62:10 - 62:13)
that word again anyways and I could go (62:11 - 62:14)
on about why I don't think Legends is (62:13 - 62:18)
ever going to be the word they use again (62:14 - 62:21)
um is isn't the story the burn Tower and (62:18 - 62:24)
like hoo and the suun and raicho and (62:21 - 62:26)
ente like that's really the story that (62:24 - 62:29)
they kind of would tell but they've told (62:26 - 62:31)
it so many times in so many different (62:29 - 62:33)
forms of (62:31 - 62:36)
media true and also like if we're (62:33 - 62:38)
talking about mythical Pokemon boy they (62:36 - 62:41)
use celab and everything yeah that's the (62:38 - 62:42)
other thing I was thinking of I think (62:41 - 62:44)
that's fair but I also think that that (62:42 - 62:45)
doesn't mean they can't come up with (62:44 - 62:47)
other things right like you can have a (62:45 - 62:50)
world before those things (62:47 - 62:52)
like would you look at Diamond and parel (62:50 - 62:56)
and go oh there's loads of old history (62:52 - 62:58)
here that I'm missing there's nothing (62:56 - 63:01)
that you're like I mean well I think I (62:58 - 63:02)
think that's why Legends works for (63:01 - 63:04)
Diamond and Pearl because Diamond and (63:02 - 63:06)
Pearl is a game based on legendary (63:04 - 63:09)
Pokemon that's its whole thing (63:06 - 63:11)
personally I want to Legends Tropa ghost (63:09 - 63:13)
but I don't think that's (63:11 - 63:16)
happening so like like real quick with (63:13 - 63:19)
the legend stuff like I can totally like (63:16 - 63:21)
if you do Legends like an older style (63:19 - 63:23)
jotto yeah like I think that makes sense (63:21 - 63:24)
you could even maybe make the argument (63:23 - 63:26)
of like Legends Unova cuz it's like oh (63:24 - 63:28)
what was the original dragon how do you (63:26 - 63:30)
merge that together right you can't (63:28 - 63:33)
apply Legends to Sun and Moon like that (63:30 - 63:35)
game isn't about legendary Pokemon it's (63:33 - 63:37)
not about like this old myth it is about (63:35 - 63:40)
Ultra Beast so that word doesn't even (63:37 - 63:42)
work there and you can't apply it to (63:40 - 63:46)
scarlet and violet because again that (63:42 - 63:48)
game is about future and past so like (63:46 - 63:50)
just the word Legend doesn't work there (63:48 - 63:53)
like that game is about Paradox (63:50 - 63:56)
so uh I guess you could maybe apply it (63:53 - 63:58)
to like X and Y but that has to do with (63:56 - 64:00)
like that's not even a legendary Pokemon (63:58 - 64:02)
that has to do with a 3,000 year old man (64:00 - 64:05)
with a flette like that's not even like (64:02 - 64:10)
I think Legends works because CNO is so (64:05 - 64:13)
legendary base the whole thing revolves (64:10 - 64:16)
around either Diga or palia and then (64:13 - 64:18)
archus and gutina and here are three (64:16 - 64:21)
Lake spirits that no one likes like uh (64:18 - 64:23)
like there's just a lot of legendary (64:21 - 64:25)
Pokemon in that game (64:23 - 64:29)
I like the L Spirits I just think (64:25 - 64:32)
that there are other things there are (64:29 - 64:34)
other things you can do in the past that (64:32 - 64:36)
aren't directly related to the legendary (64:34 - 64:38)
Pokemon (64:36 - 64:42)
though yeah historical Pokemon games (64:38 - 64:44)
which I think are I think that's what (64:42 - 64:45)
people are looking for when they say (64:44 - 64:46)
they want a new Legends game I don't (64:45 - 64:48)
think it's like oh we need to know about (64:46 - 64:50)
the history of these legendary Pokemon I (64:48 - 64:51)
think it's we want a game that's set in (64:50 - 64:54)
the past for this region which is why (64:51 - 64:56)
I'm terrified of a Legends (64:54 - 64:59)
yova but even Legends you NOA though (64:56 - 65:01)
seems a little weird because one game (64:59 - 65:04)
one game is the black is like futuristic (65:01 - 65:06)
and then white is (65:04 - 65:08)
more in the past like you have white (65:06 - 65:10)
forest and you have black (65:08 - 65:14)
city right so like how but like the the (65:10 - 65:16)
like when you think about concepts of (65:14 - 65:18)
Pokemon (65:16 - 65:21)
games like Legends like to me the (65:18 - 65:23)
concept of sorry the concept to me of (65:21 - 65:25)
sinno is Legend legendary Pokemon (65:23 - 65:27)
revolving around like archus and (65:25 - 65:29)
creating (65:27 - 65:31)
everything and when I think of the stuff (65:29 - 65:33)
for black and white they even said what (65:31 - 65:35)
black and white is it's one one game is (65:33 - 65:37)
about truth and the other game is about (65:35 - 65:40)
ideas and that doesn't like so like I'm (65:37 - 65:43)
not saying I don't want a legend Style (65:40 - 65:45)
game but I just like they don't have to (65:43 - 65:47)
go to the past to do that they (65:45 - 65:50)
can they can go to the Future they can (65:47 - 65:51)
go to the same time they can go to two (65:50 - 65:54)
years before yeah just a new story to (65:51 - 65:56)
revisit the old region yeah I think (65:54 - 65:58)
that's the thing I think the most likely (65:56 - 66:03)
thing that continues from Legends is the (65:58 - 66:08)
catching um I think you're hoping I I I (66:03 - 66:11)
will they do a game set in the past in a (66:08 - 66:14)
pre in another region possibly I I I (66:11 - 66:18)
would doubt it but possibly will they do (66:14 - 66:22)
the open area g style that they did with (66:18 - 66:23)
Legends no they're not doing that again (66:22 - 66:25)
I don't think (66:23 - 66:27)
um but the catching they would change it (66:25 - 66:29)
up they wouldn't do exactly the same but (66:27 - 66:32)
I can absolutely see that coming in in a (66:29 - 66:35)
game probably not this year maybe next (66:32 - 66:38)
year maybe the year after who knows but (66:35 - 66:39)
like yeah I think I can see I can see (66:38 - 66:41)
that coming I mean personally I would (66:39 - 66:42)
love it if that became the norm for (66:41 - 66:44)
Pokemon games but I know not everybody (66:42 - 66:47)
has that opinion and it in a way it (66:44 - 66:49)
would be a shame if they completely (66:47 - 66:52)
removed (66:49 - 66:55)
the traditional catching of Pok because (66:52 - 66:57)
that is a thing that people really like (66:55 - 66:58)
didn't remove it you just didn't you (66:57 - 66:59)
just didn't realize it Al you could just (66:58 - 67:01)
walk right up to a Pokemon and (66:59 - 67:04)
traditional catching you forgot again I (67:01 - 67:06)
did forget again apparently so I I would (67:04 - 67:07)
just like to clarify this as well (67:06 - 67:09)
because I don't think I've been on since (67:07 - 67:11)
then um it turns out I probably did do (67:09 - 67:13)
it because it seems there are some (67:11 - 67:17)
things you have to do to get to the end (67:13 - 67:20)
of the archus story yes I think there (67:17 - 67:23)
are some forced catching yeah which I I (67:20 - 67:25)
did cuz I completed everything in that (67:23 - 67:27)
game I did all of the quests and I did I (67:25 - 67:30)
didn't Perfect all of the the deck (67:27 - 67:33)
entries but I did everything else but I (67:30 - 67:35)
think I just just not memorable I well I (67:33 - 67:36)
just liked it so much and didn't really (67:35 - 67:38)
care for it that it just went from my (67:36 - 67:42)
brain no but I I like the the fact that (67:38 - 67:44)
you have that new style catching and (67:42 - 67:45)
then again talking about accessibility (67:44 - 67:47)
for people who are not good at sneaking (67:45 - 67:49)
or rolling or trying to get behind (67:47 - 67:50)
somebody (67:49 - 67:53)
or they just want to walk up and catch (67:50 - 67:54)
the old way I think that's tot totally (67:53 - 67:58)
cool and um it's nice that that game has (67:54 - 68:02)
that that option whereas um other games (67:58 - 68:03)
did (68:02 - 68:06)
not yeah I still think my ideal would be (68:03 - 68:09)
Legend style catching in the Overworld (68:06 - 68:11)
then you had the option to go into an (68:09 - 68:14)
encounter but if you faint the Pokemon (68:11 - 68:15)
then you can choose whatever Pokeball (68:14 - 68:17)
you want like in a (68:15 - 68:19)
raid I think that would be sounds (68:17 - 68:21)
awesome ideal (68:19 - 68:23)
yeah yes and I would probably choose (68:21 - 68:26)
that option when doing the Legends cuz (68:23 - 68:28)
when you were just like running around (68:26 - 68:30)
throwing balls at the Legends because (68:28 - 68:34)
they were not staying in that not (68:30 - 68:37)
fun oh yeah you know the the forces of (68:34 - 68:39)
nature are in that game oddly enough (68:37 - 68:40)
they have nothing to do with (68:39 - 68:43)
[Laughter] (68:40 - 68:46)
C that's clearly that that well that's (68:43 - 68:48)
the thing that is clearly uh we wanted (68:46 - 68:51)
to put in an amoris uh and it just (68:48 - 68:52)
happened that that was a game that they (68:51 - 68:54)
put it in and therefore the rest of them (68:52 - 68:57)
had to be there I don't I don't really (68:54 - 69:00)
think it fits thematically (68:57 - 69:00)
either so we're talking a little bit (69:00 - 69:05)
about accessibility features do we think (69:03 - 69:07)
in any future games we're going to see (69:05 - 69:11)
any sort of easy medium hard mode ever (69:07 - 69:13)
again ever again especially in a black (69:11 - 69:16)
and white revisit of some (69:13 - 69:18)
sort (69:16 - 69:20)
no I don't I know that's something (69:18 - 69:22)
people have wanted and I know it would (69:20 - 69:28)
help some people to have actually reset (69:22 - 69:31)
modes I think I think this is not any (69:28 - 69:35)
fault to Game Freak or anyone who works (69:31 - 69:37)
on Pokemon games I think it's really (69:35 - 69:41)
hard to implement a good easy normal (69:37 - 69:43)
hard mode in games I don't think a lot (69:41 - 69:48)
of games do it well uh like as as a as a (69:43 - 69:50)
kid I know when people are always like (69:48 - 69:52)
Pokemon game is a kids like Pokemon is (69:50 - 69:53)
for children why are you playing this (69:52 - 69:56)
kids game game I beat Halo on the (69:53 - 69:58)
hardest difficulty I don't know what (69:56 - 69:59)
that's called like legendary or heroic (69:58 - 70:01)
or something I was like 13 years old and (69:59 - 70:04)
I did the like if I'm I'm thinking of (70:01 - 70:05)
what's a kids game and what's not a kids (70:04 - 70:06)
game I don't know I don't really (70:05 - 70:09)
consider Halo like a game for like seven (70:06 - 70:11)
year olds but like should I have been (70:09 - 70:14)
playing Halo as 13 no I mean it was like (70:11 - 70:17)
shooting aliens like whatever but like (70:14 - 70:19)
the hard mode and this whatever like (70:17 - 70:21)
this is not to say Halo did or did not (70:19 - 70:23)
do hard mode correct because I think (70:21 - 70:26)
there was like five difficulties like I (70:23 - 70:29)
just stood behind a wall and like kept (70:26 - 70:32)
shooting and it was painfully slow but (70:29 - 70:35)
as a 13-year-old I had I had no (70:32 - 70:38)
responsibility I had more time the most (70:35 - 70:39)
time in the world so like yeah I was (70:38 - 70:41)
able to be like yeah I beat Halo on the (70:39 - 70:44)
hardest difficulty as an actual baby (70:41 - 70:47)
like 13 years old it's like baby but it (70:44 - 70:49)
was just like I don't think they did (70:47 - 70:52)
hard correctly or like but like I didn't (70:49 - 70:55)
cheat I just (70:52 - 70:57)
hid behind cover and shot very slowly (70:55 - 70:59)
until the room cleared out and then I (70:57 - 71:01)
moved on like that was the whole game (70:59 - 71:04)
and I'm put that my LinkedIn that that I (71:01 - 71:08)
did that the line is also very fine (71:04 - 71:13)
between difficult and not fun and so (71:08 - 71:15)
like would I play a difficult Pokemon (71:13 - 71:18)
game probably but where's the point (71:15 - 71:20)
where I just go I'm just not having fun (71:18 - 71:22)
anymore but you wouldn't have to have it (71:20 - 71:24)
on on hard mode (71:22 - 71:27)
choose the normal mode yeah sure sure (71:24 - 71:30)
and some people like doing all of the (71:27 - 71:31)
all of the (71:30 - 71:35)
battles everywhere all the time (71:31 - 71:37)
constant I'm not saying that as a reason (71:35 - 71:39)
not to do it right because I'm not one (71:37 - 71:41)
of these people like because one of the (71:39 - 71:42)
arguments that people have for not (71:41 - 71:44)
having difficulty levels is oh if (71:42 - 71:46)
there's an easier one I will choose it (71:44 - 71:47)
and I don't want to choose it and it's (71:46 - 71:50)
like well then just you just got to (71:47 - 71:51)
that's like the people that are like (71:50 - 71:52)
this battle is so hard it was like (71:51 - 71:54)
you're just spamming Max potion like or (71:52 - 71:56)
this battle so easy it's just like you (71:54 - 71:57)
don't you're the one spamming the max (71:56 - 72:01)
but like no one's telling you exactly (71:57 - 72:03)
exactly so it's not like oh I you know I (72:01 - 72:05)
I can't trust myself not to choose the (72:03 - 72:07)
hard hard mode it's more just a case of (72:05 - 72:11)
like I'm not like what is fun and hard (72:07 - 72:14)
to me is different to a different person (72:11 - 72:16)
and so some people it's like oh well (72:14 - 72:18)
yeah hard for me is (72:16 - 72:20)
just more grinding it's like that well (72:18 - 72:22)
that's not fun I don't want to do that (72:20 - 72:23)
I'm definitely not going to choose it if (72:22 - 72:25)
that's what it means (72:23 - 72:27)
I I I I can say that I I went through (72:25 - 72:30)
all of black two white two on hard mode (72:27 - 72:31)
I did (72:30 - 72:34)
it it was not (72:31 - 72:36)
harder and it's possible that they did (72:34 - 72:38)
it wrong but they gave every gym leader (72:36 - 72:41)
an extra Pokemon all the gym leaders (72:38 - 72:43)
were like two or three levels higher (72:41 - 72:44)
they had different they had like better (72:43 - 72:47)
move sets I think they had like better (72:44 - 72:51)
Eves and IVs but I look if you're if (72:47 - 72:53)
you're a fire gym I'm just going to (72:51 - 72:55)
bring a water Pokemon that's it it (72:53 - 72:56)
doesn't matter if you have one extra (72:55 - 72:58)
Pokemon I'm just going to hit surf one (72:56 - 73:01)
more extra time and like like and I know (72:58 - 73:03)
there are like fan-made games and all (73:01 - 73:05)
that stuff and they're intentionally (73:03 - 73:08)
hard and stuff but that is that you you (73:05 - 73:10)
are in such a (73:08 - 73:13)
minority for those kind of players and (73:10 - 73:14)
that's cool that you like that that you (73:13 - 73:17)
like that challenge and whatnot (73:14 - 73:19)
but I think like if (73:17 - 73:22)
you're but if if if if I'm going to say (73:19 - 73:24)
like do I want Pokemon to have a hard (73:22 - 73:28)
mode easy mode I my answer is no not (73:24 - 73:29)
because I don't want the games to be (73:28 - 73:32)
harder or or there should be easier but (73:29 - 73:35)
I think like I just understand that that (73:32 - 73:37)
time can go to something (73:35 - 73:41)
else and that that in the games you can (73:37 - 73:42)
already make it harder or easier for (73:41 - 73:45)
yourself that's the other thing yeah (73:42 - 73:47)
like guess like I I made scarland Violet (73:45 - 73:49)
harder for myself because I I only stuck (73:47 - 73:51)
to water type Pokemon and boy did I (73:49 - 73:54)
struggle with Yona like sh gosh it took (73:51 - 73:56)
me like five times to beat her but like (73:54 - 73:58)
everyone else pretty okay but like her (73:56 - 74:00)
that was tough uh but I had fun doing (73:58 - 74:02)
that and the game did was like how dare (74:00 - 74:04)
you not have a grass starter like no I (74:02 - 74:07)
just I went all water Pokemon it was (74:04 - 74:10)
fun so I think I'm pretty confident (74:07 - 74:11)
there wouldn't be a hard mode like a (74:10 - 74:14)
harder mode than (74:11 - 74:16)
normal I guess the question when you (74:14 - 74:17)
were talking about accessibility I guess (74:16 - 74:19)
the question then would be would they do (74:17 - 74:22)
an easy mode right which is like you're (74:19 - 74:24)
oh I'm not (74:22 - 74:26)
I they kind of did it for let's (74:24 - 74:31)
go in what way in like a parent or a (74:26 - 74:33)
friend or significant other could jump (74:31 - 74:36)
in okay yeah yeah yeah (74:33 - 74:38)
that's I would Callas it was for sure (74:36 - 74:40)
easier catching like that that's for (74:38 - 74:43)
sure that's true I think and because (74:40 - 74:45)
that game is catching I feel like that's (74:43 - 74:48)
you know that is I mean no that's a good (74:45 - 74:50)
point though that is a way that you can (74:48 - 74:52)
do that while doing something different (74:50 - 74:54)
so it's not just like oh everything's (74:52 - 74:57)
easier you actually go it's easier (74:54 - 74:59)
because of this feature that we've put (74:57 - 75:02)
in that you can optionally choose and (74:59 - 75:04)
yeah but I wouldn't ever consider that (75:02 - 75:06)
an accessibility feature if you're (75:04 - 75:08)
requiring another (75:06 - 75:10)
player I look the amount of streamers I (75:08 - 75:12)
saw just hold two joycons in their hand (75:10 - 75:13)
and just double catch everything true (75:12 - 75:15)
that was very possible I think I did (75:13 - 75:16)
that at one (75:15 - 75:20)
point I guess the question would be (75:16 - 75:22)
what what would be the purpose of an (75:20 - 75:24)
easy mode in a Pokemon game in a lot of (75:22 - 75:26)
games the easy mode tends to be like a (75:24 - 75:28)
cinematic thing where I'm in it for the (75:26 - 75:31)
story right so don't give me difficult (75:28 - 75:32)
things cuz I want (75:31 - 75:34)
to are people coming to Pokemon games (75:32 - 75:39)
for the story um is yep I I haven't (75:34 - 75:42)
played balers Gate 3 but I do know (75:39 - 75:46)
balers Gate 3 has normal hard and easy (75:42 - 75:48)
but when they say easy it is literally (75:46 - 75:52)
like I only care about the story minimal (75:48 - 75:54)
combat and I know people people who are (75:52 - 75:55)
that that's why they're playing balers (75:54 - 75:57)
gate is literally for the story and the (75:55 - 76:00)
choices and to make two characters Kiss (75:57 - 76:02)
that is like 99% of balers gate is like (76:00 - 76:05)
who can we make date each other and kiss (76:02 - 76:08)
and so that makes sense that they have a (76:05 - 76:10)
pretty ultimately like I only care about (76:08 - 76:11)
the story minimal (76:10 - 76:13)
combat I don't know how hard the hard (76:11 - 76:16)
mode is in balers gate I tell you what (76:13 - 76:21)
you could do is a focus we' talked (76:16 - 76:23)
previously about the Pokemon games not (76:21 - 76:26)
really having a Focus option right you (76:23 - 76:28)
are the point of these games is to catch (76:26 - 76:31)
all the Pokemon and to be good at (76:28 - 76:35)
battling you could do an easy mode where (76:31 - 76:37)
you remove one of those or you reduce (76:35 - 76:38)
one of those so significantly that it (76:37 - 76:40)
doesn't really matter and so it's like I (76:38 - 76:42)
don't care about battling I have never (76:40 - 76:44)
cared about battling with Pokemon I care (76:42 - 76:47)
about catching Pokemon and so giving you (76:44 - 76:50)
the option to say which of these do you (76:47 - 76:52)
care about and you can say all of them (76:50 - 76:54)
or you can say one of them (76:52 - 76:59)
and that would reduce battling or reduce (76:54 - 77:02)
requirements for catching that's the (76:59 - 77:04)
sort of thing you could also do which (77:02 - 77:06)
would give you not it's not because like (77:04 - 77:08)
I'm I'm a (77:06 - 77:10)
strong a strong believer that (77:08 - 77:13)
accessibility is important but is also (77:10 - 77:15)
important for people in general like the (77:13 - 77:17)
best accessibility features are (77:15 - 77:19)
accessibility features that aren't just (77:17 - 77:22)
built with one particular thing in mind (77:19 - 77:24)
that never affect any body else but (77:22 - 77:26)
there's something that actually (77:24 - 77:28)
everybody ends up benefiting from is a (77:26 - 77:30)
really good way of doing it because you (77:28 - 77:32)
get people going and I'm not saying that (77:30 - 77:34)
something that only benefits somebody (77:32 - 77:36)
with a particular disability is (77:34 - 77:40)
bad my mind I think when you're able to (77:36 - 77:43)
then make that and it also advantages (77:40 - 77:45)
everyone else if you want it to you get (77:43 - 77:47)
Buy in from normal people as well and (77:45 - 77:50)
you go oh yeah I see how that's a really (77:47 - 77:53)
good thing then um which yeah it's a bit (77:50 - 77:56)
sad that people have to be explained (77:53 - 77:59)
but being able to take that and also (77:56 - 78:01)
give us another good thing would also be (77:59 - 78:04)
really would be cool yeah that kind of (78:01 - 78:07)
reminds me of one way that I'd imagined (78:04 - 78:09)
Pokemon games going as a kid where you (78:07 - 78:12)
could choose to be a Pokemon collector (78:09 - 78:14)
or you could choose to be a Pokemon (78:12 - 78:16)
professor or a trainer and you would (78:14 - 78:18)
basically have a role and you would aim (78:16 - 78:22)
to be the best in that role and I guess (78:18 - 78:24)
in some ways that makes sense but that (78:22 - 78:27)
also feels limiting to me personally I (78:24 - 78:29)
don't know if that feels like a better (78:27 - 78:31)
thing to me when we were describing an (78:29 - 78:34)
easy mode that focuses on the story that (78:31 - 78:36)
makes sense to me that's something I (78:34 - 78:39)
would even potentially like though I (78:36 - 78:43)
probably wouldn't do it um but having a (78:39 - 78:46)
game where you basically just say hey I (78:43 - 78:48)
don't like battles at all I am going to (78:46 - 78:50)
be a Pokemon collector I don't want to (78:48 - 78:53)
see any of the other things I'm not sure (78:50 - 78:55)
I'm not sure how I feel about that well (78:53 - 78:56)
I mean play Legends there's only like (78:55 - 78:59)
seven battles in that entire game well I (78:56 - 79:00)
I don't think I would turn any of those (78:59 - 79:02)
on for my first play through of the game (79:00 - 79:03)
but see on my fourth playthrough of (79:02 - 79:05)
scarlet Violet if I could have said I (79:03 - 79:07)
want no battles I would have checked (79:05 - 79:11)
that box so fast right like I I was not (79:07 - 79:12)
with the fourth playthrough of those (79:11 - 79:15)
games I was not in it for any of that I (79:12 - 79:17)
was in it for the game being done so I (79:15 - 79:21)
could do the raids right that was the (79:17 - 79:21)
point all right not too to get not not (79:21 - 79:27)
to force shifting gears but I don't want (79:24 - 79:30)
this episode to be 5 hours long um I (79:27 - 79:31)
think I think for Pokemon day we're (79:30 - 79:35)
we're going to get release dates for the (79:31 - 79:39)
soundtracks um we know they're coming (79:35 - 79:43)
the scarlet and violet Legends archus I (79:39 - 79:46)
don't know if they said bdsp but I don't (79:43 - 79:47)
think they did I don't think they did (79:46 - 79:50)
but scarlet and violet isn't the bdsp (79:47 - 79:51)
soundtrack already out there somewhere (79:50 - 79:53)
yeah I think they give that away for (79:51 - 79:55)
free I think that was last year's (79:53 - 79:56)
Pokemon day where you could go to a (79:55 - 79:59)
website and download it for personal use (79:56 - 80:02)
it um that wasn't the one that was on (79:59 - 80:04)
the weird app that appeared for like a (80:02 - 80:06)
few months and then died no I don't (80:04 - 80:09)
think I don't think so I don't think it (80:06 - 80:11)
was that so the the actual thing I get (80:09 - 80:13)
this question all the time because I I (80:11 - 80:15)
play Pokemon music when I'm like setting (80:13 - 80:16)
up stream or when I'm like going to the (80:15 - 80:17)
bathroom and people are like Steve where (80:16 - 80:20)
did you get the music from I got it from (80:17 - 80:24)
iTunes yes you've heard it Apple iTunes (80:20 - 80:26)
they still sell all of the Pokemon music (80:24 - 80:30)
on iTunes uh Pokemon made a deal with (80:26 - 80:33)
Apple at some point this is why the (80:30 - 80:36)
Pokemon music is not on Spotify or (80:33 - 80:39)
YouTube um oh look I'm sure you could (80:36 - 80:42)
find on YouTube just not buy (80:39 - 80:45)
Pokemon uh I don't know how long that (80:42 - 80:47)
deal is I don't know if scarlet and (80:45 - 80:48)
violent sword and shield is going to go (80:47 - 80:51)
up on iTunes uh in Japan CDs are still (80:48 - 80:54)
really popular so like you can already (80:51 - 80:56)
import the Scarlet or you can at least (80:54 - 80:57)
pre-order the scarlet and violet sword (80:56 - 81:00)
and shield CDs from Japan it's like six (80:57 - 81:05)
or seven discs so I guess the the (81:00 - 81:08)
announcement would be is it going to go (81:05 - 81:11)
to iTunes is there going to be CDs in (81:08 - 81:13)
America are they going to sign a new (81:11 - 81:15)
deal with Spotify (81:13 - 81:18)
like don't know unsure but I would (81:15 - 81:20)
assume they would be talking about the (81:18 - 81:23)
music for Pokemon day um (81:20 - 81:24)
there has (81:23 - 81:27)
been just to go through all the events (81:24 - 81:28)
there has been a cafe (81:27 - 81:31)
remix they talk about it every Pokemon (81:28 - 81:34)
day since it's existed I suspect that (81:31 - 81:36)
will be talked about again Pokemon (81:34 - 81:38)
Masters they have always done a specific (81:36 - 81:42)
syn pair uh last year was May and Latias (81:38 - 81:45)
the year before that was Leon and (81:42 - 81:47)
Charizard the year before that was red (81:45 - 81:48)
and (81:47 - 81:51)
Charizard um so I would I would I (81:48 - 81:53)
wouldn't even like geez at this point (81:51 - 81:56)
point I Leo and spring atito like I who (81:53 - 81:58)
knows probably a (81:56 - 82:02)
legendary yeah so I would expect (81:58 - 82:05)
Charizard and (82:02 - 82:07)
whatever so I I would (82:05 - 82:11)
suspect Masters new pair probably 3,000 (82:07 - 82:13)
free gems if you log in today 100 sync (82:11 - 82:16)
pairs like they always do (82:13 - 82:19)
um uh Pokemon sleep event I think we (82:16 - 82:20)
talked about that there's no way they (82:19 - 82:21)
don't bring up Pokemon sleep they don't (82:20 - 82:23)
bring up how many downloads it as how (82:21 - 82:25)
many people are (82:23 - 82:26)
sleeping (82:25 - 82:29)
um I have question marks next to these (82:26 - 82:35)
does TCG live get any recognition slash (82:29 - 82:36)
an (82:35 - 82:40)
update no I wouldn't expect (82:36 - 82:43)
it I wouldn't hold my breath for (82:40 - 82:47)
it we know that we know we know that the (82:43 - 82:52)
issues of new features in the old online (82:47 - 82:54)
app were not because the developers (82:52 - 82:56)
didn't want to do that right so I don't (82:54 - 82:58)
know why that would (82:56 - 82:58)
change no Dire Wolf digital did want to (82:58 - 83:04)
fix a lot of things they just were not (83:02 - 83:06)
allowed to exactly I don't I don't see (83:04 - 83:08)
that changing the app is the app is (83:06 - 83:10)
there might be some bunk fixes at some (83:08 - 83:11)
point and obviously they'll update it (83:10 - 83:13)
with the new cards but that's all (83:11 - 83:13)
they're (83:13 - 83:17)
doing um they they did make a big deal (83:13 - 83:21)
about Hawaii or about Japan last year (83:17 - 83:21)
for (83:21 - 83:25)
worlds are they going to bring up Hawaii (83:21 - 83:26)
this (83:25 - 83:28)
year I feel like they can't bring it up (83:26 - 83:32)
without saying we've also done another (83:28 - 83:35)
donation have people (83:32 - 83:37)
forgotten America yes because America (83:35 - 83:40)
moves on from things very quickly well (83:37 - 83:43)
that's the thing and and I I can't (83:40 - 83:46)
see many of like because it because it's (83:43 - 83:47)
America so if I if if America isn't (83:46 - 83:49)
caring about it I can't see other people (83:47 - 83:51)
caring about (83:49 - 83:55)
it yeah it's just it's just not in I I (83:51 - 83:57)
mean I to be fair I don't watch a lot of (83:55 - 84:00)
news but like Hannah you can correct me (83:57 - 84:01)
but I feel like no one is talking about (84:00 - 84:03)
Hawaii right now well there was an (84:01 - 84:06)
earthquake there yesterday (84:03 - 84:09)
but pretty sizable one mostly on the big (84:06 - 84:12)
island I'm pretty sure (84:09 - 84:15)
um but I haven't heard anything about (84:12 - 84:17)
the wildfires in a while except for my (84:15 - 84:19)
friends who live there where I mean (84:17 - 84:23)
there are still issues I'm still not (84:19 - 84:26)
super happy that worlds is going to be (84:23 - 84:29)
there but they'll probably mention it (84:26 - 84:30)
they're probably excited to go vacation (84:29 - 84:33)
there for (84:30 - 84:35)
Pokemon it's (84:33 - 84:40)
happening yeah it can't not (84:35 - 84:40)
happen um I think when they announced (84:41 - 84:47)
their initial donation which I don't (84:44 - 84:49)
remember how much it was um that they (84:47 - 84:53)
said that this was the first of their (84:49 - 84:55)
donations I didn't I think they said (84:53 - 84:59)
that this was not their only (84:55 - 85:02)
donation so I don't know what that looks (84:59 - 85:04)
like I don't even know if they bring it (85:02 - 85:08)
up just because it's a touchy (85:04 - 85:11)
subject I don't think they (85:08 - 85:17)
would um the amount the amount they (85:11 - 85:17)
donated was (85:17 - 85:24)
$200,000 okay 200,000 yeah I think they (85:19 - 85:28)
probably know that the positivity of the (85:24 - 85:30)
people who are excited about it probably (85:28 - 85:32)
massively overrides the people who are (85:30 - 85:35)
still weary and and upset about it and (85:32 - 85:37)
so I think they talk about it and they (85:35 - 85:39)
go hey we're excited about this and then (85:37 - 85:41)
they move they probably don't focus on (85:39 - 85:43)
it too much but I think they mention (85:41 - 85:47)
it yeah um like they're doing it in (85:43 - 85:49)
Hawaii because people love Hawaii right (85:47 - 85:50)
like they're doing they're also doing it (85:49 - 85:52)
because it's halfway between Japan and (85:50 - 85:54)
the United States and those are the two (85:52 - 85:57)
biggest player bases okay yeah fair I (85:54 - 85:59)
bet that doesn't make the flights cheap (85:57 - 86:02)
though uh yeah I don't think (85:59 - 86:03)
so (86:02 - 86:07)
um maybe slightly cheaper than Cal no (86:03 - 86:08)
California flying to California probably (86:07 - 86:11)
cheaper yeah than to (86:08 - 86:17)
Hawaii I I I like I feel obligated to go (86:11 - 86:18)
because there's so much Pokemon news (86:17 - 86:21)
there and I like report on it and stuff (86:18 - 86:23)
i' I've talked about this before like (86:21 - 86:25)
Hawaii has never been on my list of (86:23 - 86:28)
places to visit cuz it feels to me like (86:25 - 86:30)
a very outdoor touristy place and I'm (86:28 - 86:33)
not that big of an outdoor touristy (86:30 - 86:35)
person like I like walking outside I (86:33 - 86:38)
like seeing things but like I'm not a (86:35 - 86:40)
beach person I'm not a surfing person (86:38 - 86:42)
I'm not a let's climb this volcano (86:40 - 86:45)
person you like playing Pokemon go the (86:42 - 86:47)
weather is good (86:45 - 86:51)
um there are ways that you can do it (86:47 - 86:53)
better than others there are ways that (86:51 - 86:58)
you can go and Su uh uh support native (86:53 - 87:01)
Hawaiians more so than big hotel chains (86:58 - 87:05)
Airbnb things like that yeah yeah like (87:01 - 87:06)
I'm I'm I'm probably going to go but I (87:05 - 87:10)
have to look into like what is the what (87:06 - 87:11)
is the good way (87:10 - 87:14)
to travel there and I I probably (87:11 - 87:17)
wouldn't like with Japan it was like (87:14 - 87:19)
okay I'm going to arrive like a week (87:17 - 87:20)
early I'm going to stay a week late (87:19 - 87:23)
because it's so much effort to get there (87:20 - 87:24)
and plus (87:23 - 87:27)
like man papa pikachu made me work in (87:24 - 87:29)
Japan like I had to be up at like 6 o'cl (87:27 - 87:30)
every morning so like I didn't even get (87:29 - 87:32)
to do the Japan stuff until after the (87:30 - 87:34)
World Tournament but if in the Hawaii (87:32 - 87:36)
situation I think it's literally go (87:34 - 87:39)
there do the tournament (87:36 - 87:42)
leave maybe have one extra day (87:39 - 87:46)
for rest and then leave but yeah I don't (87:42 - 87:48)
I don't know if they if they bring that (87:46 - 87:53)
up so sleep TCG live cafe remix (87:48 - 87:56)
Pokemon go I'm sure they'll mention (87:53 - 88:00)
cotour being a a success or something um (87:56 - 88:02)
Pokemon Masters EX Pokemon (88:00 - 88:05)
unite like that's that's a lot of time (88:02 - 88:07)
in a present presentation just dedicated (88:05 - 88:09)
to side games and I think they mention (88:07 - 88:12)
all of those like I don't think we don't (88:09 - 88:13)
it would be very weird if they don't (88:12 - 88:17)
mention unite go ex sleep I just thought (88:13 - 88:19)
of something so obviously just to (88:17 - 88:21)
preface this they are not bringing the (88:19 - 88:23)
main Series games to Nintendo switch (88:21 - 88:24)
online that's just not (88:23 - 88:26)
happening oh yeah it's not happening but (88:24 - 88:29)
also we I did look up numbers for (88:26 - 88:33)
this because people think like why don't (88:29 - 88:34)
they just bring the games it should just (88:33 - 88:39)
be easy easy money all six of those (88:34 - 88:42)
versions red blue yellow technically (88:39 - 88:44)
green I guess in Japan crystal gold (88:42 - 88:50)
silver combined only sold 1.5 (88:44 - 88:53)
million that's seven games (88:50 - 88:55)
this is why I said ignore it in my thing (88:53 - 88:56)
I was talking about earlier with all the (88:55 - 89:01)
sales the but here's a question what if (88:56 - 89:03)
I don't think they'll do this but what (89:01 - 89:05)
if they brought the second trading card (89:03 - 89:08)
game and translated it and we finally (89:05 - 89:10)
were able to play it in English and they (89:08 - 89:11)
put that on (89:10 - 89:13)
instead oh that would be cool that would (89:11 - 89:15)
be really (89:13 - 89:18)
cool yeah was the announcement of the (89:15 - 89:20)
first one uh that was in a Nintendo (89:18 - 89:23)
Direct right it it was yes it was a (89:20 - 89:25)
Nintendo Direct because that was with (89:23 - 89:26)
their that was in their initial Game Boy (89:25 - 89:28)
coming and here's a bunch of games and (89:26 - 89:30)
it included the trading card game yeah (89:28 - 89:32)
so I would almost expect it to be in a (89:30 - 89:34)
Nintendo Direct announcement rather than (89:32 - 89:37)
a Pokemon day announcement if that (89:34 - 89:39)
happened possibly but we're probably (89:37 - 89:41)
getting that around the same sort of (89:39 - 89:44)
time anyway so I could I could see well (89:41 - 89:46)
I mean I I expect the Nintendo Direct (89:44 - 89:47)
next week maybe they announce it in that (89:46 - 89:49)
and then they reiterate it in Pokemon (89:47 - 89:51)
day the week after that's definitely (89:49 - 89:52)
possible (89:51 - 89:55)
here's what I want I don't care no I (89:52 - 89:56)
don't care about black and white don't (89:55 - 89:58)
care about scarlet and violet d DLC (89:56 - 90:01)
don't care about jotto give me the (89:58 - 90:06)
Chinese version of Pokemon Quest I want (90:01 - 90:09)
that that is what I want for Pokemon day (90:06 - 90:13)
yeah that game looks awesome there's so (90:09 - 90:15)
much more of that game now yeah they're (90:13 - 90:19)
up to they're up to Galler aren't they (90:15 - 90:20)
yeah yeah cuz they put zashi and (90:19 - 90:22)
zamazenta in that game and they're I (90:20 - 90:25)
know I've seen eternus in Pokemon Quest (90:22 - 90:27)
yeah Cube (90:25 - 90:32)
Style Pokemon Quest is the only spin-off (90:27 - 90:35)
Pokemon game that game freak has made (90:32 - 90:37)
fun fact they have made obviously other (90:35 - 90:40)
spin-offs like Tempo and pocket card (90:37 - 90:42)
jockey and stuff like that but it's the (90:40 - 90:44)
only spin-off Pokemon game game freak (90:42 - 90:46)
has made they made it for this they came (90:44 - 90:48)
out around the same time well they came (90:46 - 90:50)
out before let's go Pikachu let's go (90:48 - 90:52)
Eevee don't know how many people worked (90:50 - 90:54)
on it well I guess you could look at the (90:52 - 90:56)
credits um (90:54 - 90:59)
but the Chinese version is not made by (90:56 - 91:01)
Game Freak they sold it to a different (90:59 - 91:03)
company I don't remember what that (91:01 - 91:06)
company is called but China has a lot of (91:03 - 91:10)
these games are exclusive to China (91:06 - 91:13)
um but (91:10 - 91:13)
whoever I I bring it bring it bring it (91:14 - 91:19)
over here get rename it Pokemon Quest 2 (91:16 - 91:21)
bring it over here give us the full (91:19 - 91:24)
thing I think that is so fun so (91:21 - 91:25)
Charming (91:24 - 91:28)
um the microtransactions in that game (91:25 - 91:30)
were like completely Fair they were (91:28 - 91:32)
really easy to ignore otherwise I think (91:30 - 91:35)
it was like like three $15 purchase (91:32 - 91:36)
packs that you could get and then you (91:35 - 91:37)
didn't really have to spend any more (91:36 - 91:40)
money like what a what a great game I (91:37 - 91:42)
would love to see that that's what (91:40 - 91:44)
that's what I would love to see I agree (91:42 - 91:47)
it's not gonna happen but yeah I I would (91:44 - 91:48)
I would love it as well like I mean this (91:47 - 91:51)
the thing it's so many years since it (91:48 - 91:52)
they could have done it any point I (91:51 - 91:54)
don't think they're now going to decide (91:52 - 91:57)
that it's now the problem is as well is (91:54 - 91:58)
the license would mean they' probably (91:57 - 92:03)
have to pay quite a lot to get it to to (91:58 - 92:06)
release it outside of China and there (92:03 - 92:09)
probably wouldn't make a lot of money on (92:06 - 92:10)
that (92:09 - 92:12)
like some of us would love it and would (92:10 - 92:14)
play it but I don't think a humongous (92:12 - 92:17)
number of people would I think I think (92:14 - 92:19)
quest would have failed if it sat on a (92:17 - 92:21)
retail shelf for like 40 bucks I think (92:19 - 92:25)
how they did it as free was like the (92:21 - 92:27)
right way to do it is the Chinese (92:25 - 92:29)
version cuz I think the the original was (92:27 - 92:32)
on mobile and switch right switch is the (92:29 - 92:35)
Chinese one on both as well I think it's (92:32 - 92:37)
only mobile right I don't think it's (92:35 - 92:38)
switch at all I think it's just mobile (92:37 - 92:41)
well and that that I think increases my (92:38 - 92:42)
confidence they wouldn't do it because (92:41 - 92:43)
they're not they're not going to pour it (92:42 - 92:45)
onto switch and I don't think they would (92:43 - 92:47)
release it without it being on switch (92:45 - 92:49)
yeah I I I don't think it's coming well (92:47 - 92:51)
it's what I want though that's fair (92:49 - 92:52)
that's fair we're talking about what we (92:51 - 92:54)
want not necessarily what we think is (92:52 - 92:55)
gonna (92:54 - 92:58)
happen it's what I (92:55 - 93:01)
want uh the the last thing I have and if (92:58 - 93:03)
you guys have anything else that's cool (93:01 - 93:07)
is I think it was such a big deal that (93:03 - 93:10)
Pokemon partnered with 10 cent to do (93:07 - 93:14)
Pokemon unite and Pokemon partnered with (93:10 - 93:17)
uh Namco Bandai Bandai Namco not sure (93:14 - 93:19)
the order for poke in tournament and new (93:17 - 93:24)
Pokemon Snap I think that we we see or I (93:19 - 93:26)
wouldn't be surprised if we see another (93:24 - 93:29)
like partnership like that (93:26 - 93:32)
for some sort of new (93:29 - 93:35)
game like I would love to see Pokemon (93:32 - 93:37)
partner with like hoyo verse because (93:35 - 93:39)
hoyo verse is killing it when it comes (93:37 - 93:44)
to like their games like genin uh hanai (93:39 - 93:46)
star rail like just completely (93:44 - 93:48)
dominating the mobile charts and what (93:46 - 93:52)
they do um huge Chinese company (93:48 - 93:55)
so um it would be (93:52 - 93:59)
cool to see them partner with an (93:55 - 94:02)
established game brand for something new (93:59 - 94:05)
because I I I think everyone liked new (94:02 - 94:07)
Pokemon Snap and that was that was the (94:05 - 94:09)
same people who did Pok (94:07 - 94:12)
tournament um and you know people like (94:09 - 94:14)
Pokemon (94:12 - 94:14)
unite yeah I mean that's going to be the (94:16 - 94:20)
kind of thing that we just can't predict (94:18 - 94:23)
yeah for the most part (94:20 - 94:25)
unless they're going to continue some (94:23 - 94:27)
spin-off series and just hand it over to (94:25 - 94:30)
a new company but that seems it seems (94:27 - 94:32)
you know what what what's chuna doing (94:30 - 94:34)
nowadays another mystery dungeon for for (94:32 - 94:36)
for us (94:34 - 94:36)
all yeah I I I mean they absolutely (94:37 - 94:43)
could do something brand new um I I (94:40 - 94:46)
think I'm trying to remember unite (94:43 - 94:49)
wasn't announced at all in a Pokemon day (94:46 - 94:51)
it was announced a week after Pokemon (94:49 - 94:53)
day they said in Pokémon day that we (94:51 - 94:56)
have another announcement that was (94:53 - 94:58)
weird I remember that weird that was (94:56 - 95:00)
weird than two I think I think that's (94:58 - 95:02)
that was probably just like 10 cent (95:00 - 95:04)
wanting their own (95:02 - 95:08)
probably their own Spotlight yeah so (95:04 - 95:11)
just just as a quick point the the um (95:08 - 95:12)
brilliant Diamond shining parl (95:11 - 95:14)
soundtrack I was right it was only up (95:12 - 95:17)
for three months yeah it was I think I (95:14 - 95:19)
downloaded it I think I downloaded the (95:17 - 95:20)
first day cuz I was like oh I bet (95:19 - 95:22)
they're pulling this yeah went up in (95:20 - 95:25)
February went down in May of the same (95:22 - 95:27)
year um so that is what I was thinking (95:25 - 95:30)
of okay I hadn't thought of it as an app (95:27 - 95:31)
i' thought of it as a website yeah yeah (95:30 - 95:34)
yeah web app website whatever (95:31 - 95:36)
terminology doesn't matter but yeah no I (95:34 - 95:38)
just I I double checked yeah it was wild (95:36 - 95:42)
how it was short that (95:38 - 95:44)
disappeared it's three months is long (95:42 - 95:45)
enough to be on the internet forever I'm (95:44 - 95:49)
sure yes well sure sure but legality (95:45 - 95:52)
Steve we don't uh we we do not uh (95:49 - 95:55)
condone piracy on this podcast I cannot (95:52 - 95:58)
give Apple 9.99 to to download it is (95:55 - 96:00)
what you're saying yeah like I can't for (95:58 - 96:02)
black to white to soundtrack (96:00 - 96:06)
yeah um all right that I I'm I'm out of (96:02 - 96:09)
things on my little my little notepad (96:06 - 96:11)
anything else you guys want to see or (96:09 - 96:13)
that we didn't talk (96:11 - 96:15)
about the only other thing I can think (96:13 - 96:18)
of predictions wise is just sort of (96:15 - 96:22)
speculating about what features from the (96:18 - 96:25)
DLC we think may (96:22 - 96:28)
be hinting at things in future games (96:25 - 96:30)
because we have seen the DLC kind of (96:28 - 96:33)
bring in new features before and if we (96:30 - 96:35)
think there are anything anything in (96:33 - 96:37)
blueberry especially that may be (96:35 - 96:40)
implemented in future games like uh poke (96:37 - 96:43)
Park 3 with the Synchro (96:40 - 96:47)
machine I don't know who made poke (96:43 - 96:47)
Park uh side note though because that (96:48 - 96:53)
made me think of it Hannah I would this (96:50 - 96:55)
is a really early prediction I think gen (96:53 - 96:58)
10 takes place in (96:55 - 97:02)
China because of the treasures of room (96:58 - 97:04)
yeah the treasures oh (97:02 - 97:07)
interesting um (97:04 - 97:09)
creatures developed poke Park creatures (97:07 - 97:12)
Inc oh well you know it took him like 10 (97:09 - 97:13)
years to make detective Pikachu too so (97:12 - 97:15)
what (97:13 - 97:18)
another yeah they don't make many games (97:15 - 97:20)
they're most mostly just doing those (97:18 - 97:24)
models sure (97:20 - 97:24)
don't there's no way like like I was (97:24 - 97:29)
like oh maybe poke Park 3 but man the (97:27 - 97:30)
the time they took to make detective (97:29 - 97:34)
Pikachu I I don't see that (97:30 - 97:34)
happening you got anything else H you're (97:37 - 97:41)
like no sorry I fell down a wikkipedia (97:39 - 97:43)
hole there (97:41 - 97:46)
okay I've closed the tab we're all good (97:43 - 97:48)
I'm just trying to think of new features (97:46 - 97:51)
from the DLC that that may be leading I (97:48 - 97:53)
think the Synchro machine is the most (97:51 - 97:55)
likely thing that we're going to see (97:53 - 97:57)
whatever it was that they want that that (97:55 - 97:59)
Vision was is going to come in in a (97:57 - 98:00)
future game that's definitely not (97:59 - 98:04)
happening this year yeah probably (98:00 - 98:06)
not I would say the opposite I would say (98:04 - 98:08)
Pokemon's very good at adding features (98:06 - 98:09)
and then completely scrapping them for (98:08 - 98:11)
future games I I think you're you're (98:09 - 98:13)
right but I think that there are some (98:11 - 98:16)
some of the features they never reappear (98:13 - 98:19)
but then sometimes you see in the next (98:16 - 98:21)
version of that what they wanted to do (98:19 - 98:23)
like when we talked about the the (98:21 - 98:26)
Legends catching like that very much (98:23 - 98:28)
feels to me like it was the let's the (98:26 - 98:30)
let's go Vision but they didn't do it in (98:28 - 98:33)
that game um I also think like things (98:30 - 98:37)
like the um Omega Ruby and Alpha (98:33 - 98:39)
Sapphire soaring that was clearly a want (98:37 - 98:42)
to go towards an open world type game (98:39 - 98:44)
with that sort of stuff and we didn't (98:42 - 98:45)
see it for multiple more games but it (98:44 - 98:48)
still came back soaring was a thing (98:45 - 98:49)
following Pokemon has been a thing that (98:48 - 98:52)
we've seen them test out in yeah sword (98:49 - 98:54)
and shield DLC and that actually showed (98:52 - 98:57)
up in the newer games we saw uh the that (98:54 - 98:59)
great but you (98:57 - 99:02)
know kind of expand the wild area out to (98:59 - 99:05)
the full islands that they had there (99:02 - 99:08)
instead of just condensed into the wild (99:05 - 99:10)
area and then locked in the single point (99:08 - 99:12)
of view for the rest of the game so that (99:10 - 99:14)
was another thing we saw with the DLC (99:12 - 99:16)
there that expanded into scarlet and (99:14 - 99:19)
violet and legends (99:16 - 99:19)
even h (99:20 - 99:26)
yeah I'm just trying to find hints hints (99:22 - 99:27)
for what we might see in the future but (99:26 - 99:29)
I think I think the Synchro machine is (99:27 - 99:32)
the one that really seems like something (99:29 - 99:35)
they may build on to me I yeah I also (99:32 - 99:37)
wonder whether it was also a way of (99:35 - 99:40)
thinking about biomes (99:37 - 99:44)
differently um because the way that the (99:40 - 99:46)
blueberry Academy Works compared to the (99:44 - 99:47)
other regions is very different like (99:46 - 99:51)
it's very Stark here are the biomes (99:47 - 99:52)
whereas and other ones they kind of (99:51 - 99:55)
bleed into each other a lot more um (99:52 - 99:56)
there's not like I mean obviously (99:55 - 99:58)
there's like there's the mountain with (99:56 - 100:01)
the snow but it's not like there's a (99:58 - 100:03)
hard line that's very clear demarcation (100:01 - 100:06)
between them and stuff like that that (100:03 - 100:08)
that kind of leads into something i' (100:06 - 100:11)
thought about with the way they made (100:08 - 100:13)
blueberry Academy I don't remember (100:11 - 100:14)
whether I've said this on the podcast (100:13 - 100:17)
before the dimensions and how close (100:14 - 100:20)
everything is together in blueberry is (100:17 - 100:22)
unrealistic (100:20 - 100:24)
but in a good way things are closer (100:22 - 100:26)
together than they could realistically (100:24 - 100:29)
be there are paintings that do this that (100:26 - 100:31)
just look amazing Vistas but the (100:29 - 100:33)
mountain is way closer than it ever (100:31 - 100:37)
could be in real life with with real uh (100:33 - 100:41)
sizes of everything yeah proportions um (100:37 - 100:44)
and that's not how the rest of Pala is (100:41 - 100:47)
Pala is much more realistic much more (100:44 - 100:50)
spread out and I guess I'm curious to (100:47 - 100:53)
see whether future games will be more (100:50 - 100:55)
blueberry just because one of the things (100:53 - 100:57)
I remember everybody talking about with (100:55 - 100:59)
the main game of scarlet and violet was (100:57 - 101:03)
that Pala wasn't super fun to (100:59 - 101:06)
explore the traversal was something (101:03 - 101:08)
people didn't enjoy that much and (101:06 - 101:10)
blueberry I think they improved it with (101:08 - 101:13)
the proportions and with the density of (101:10 - 101:15)
everything being except for the Savannah (101:13 - 101:18)
that place sucks it's too Savannah is uh (101:15 - 101:21)
laggy yes it's the laggiest one (101:18 - 101:23)
yeah they also added flying as well (101:21 - 101:26)
which changes things quite a bit yes the (101:23 - 101:28)
the flying kind of mixes into the (101:26 - 101:30)
Synchro machine in my head thinking (101:28 - 101:32)
maybe in future games they would have (101:30 - 101:34)
better traversal for all the (101:32 - 101:36)
Pokemon with the flying aspects because (101:34 - 101:39)
you can't actually fly with flying (101:36 - 101:41)
Pokemon in the Synchro (101:39 - 101:43)
machine which is wild to you also can't (101:41 - 101:46)
jump which is also you you can't (101:43 - 101:48)
actually go between the biomes or get (101:46 - 101:53)
into the thing in the the Center area (101:48 - 101:55)
because you can't jump you can't get (101:53 - 101:57)
over the ledges the doors have Ledges (101:55 - 102:00)
you need to ride cide (101:57 - 102:03)
on (102:00 - 102:06)
yeah well all right I think that's our (102:03 - 102:10)
episode sorry low energy (102:06 - 102:11)
speculating (102:10 - 102:15)
uh if I saw you at C go tour it was good (102:11 - 102:17)
to meet you if I didn't see you (102:15 - 102:19)
[Laughter] (102:17 - 102:22)
sorry uh let me look at the calendar all (102:19 - 102:24)
right so this comes out on the 19th so (102:22 - 102:27)
we will still have one more episode (102:24 - 102:30)
before Pokemon day um and then maybe (102:27 - 102:33)
we'll do like a small bonus episode or (102:30 - 102:35)
something after Pokemon day unsure maybe (102:33 - 102:38)
again it could be a very exciting (102:35 - 102:40)
Pokemon day or it could be a 2017 (102:38 - 102:45)
Pokemon day and boy look at I I (102:40 - 102:47)
encourage you to maybe look at the 2017 (102:45 - 102:50)
Pokemon day and go wow that was (102:47 - 102:51)
bad (102:50 - 102:54)
because it (102:51 - 102:54)
was could be a forgettable a forgettable (102:55 - 103:00)
anime focused Pokemon day or a memorable (102:58 - 103:04)
anime focused Pokemon day either (103:00 - 103:06)
way we know it's gonna be an anime (103:04 - 103:09)
focused Pokemon Day 2017 was Ultra Sun (103:06 - 103:11)
Ultra Moon wasn't it and they they (103:09 - 103:12)
didn't even announce that was announced (103:11 - 103:15)
in me they announced yeah Ultra Sun (103:12 - 103:16)
Ultra moon in in may they didn't (103:15 - 103:19)
announce it for Pokemon day yeah 2017 (103:16 - 103:21)
was Pikachu with party hat for the first (103:19 - 103:24)
time and go Pokemon Gallery figures why (103:21 - 103:25)
you why are you making it out like it (103:24 - 103:28)
wasn't a good day then that was great (103:25 - 103:29)
they weren't shiny though that was the (103:28 - 103:32)
first time they appeared I literally (103:29 - 103:33)
this is literally everything they (103:32 - 103:35)
announced in 2017 Pikachu with party hat (103:33 - 103:37)
for the first time in go not shiny (103:35 - 103:39)
because shinies were not a thing yet uh (103:37 - 103:41)
the Pokemon Gallery Figures were added (103:39 - 103:44)
to Pokemon Center which were like the (103:41 - 103:47)
the $30 plastic figures that were not (103:44 - 103:49)
that great um and then Pokemon movies (103:47 - 103:52)
were added to Pokemon TV (103:49 - 103:55)
Amazon Prime video and (103:52 - 103:58)
um uh and Hulu that was it that was that (103:55 - 104:01)
was your 2017 Pokemon day that was the (103:58 - 104:03)
same year Ultra Sun Ultra Moon came out (104:01 - 104:04)
but they did not talk about Ultra sun (104:03 - 104:06)
and Ultra moon during Pokemon day that (104:04 - 104:09)
was that was right before that was (104:06 - 104:13)
around E3 um but not necessarily E3 (104:09 - 104:14)
wasn't the first Community Day around (104:13 - 104:17)
there (104:14 - 104:17)
sometime uh yes but I think they talked (104:17 - 104:23)
about that in Jan anuary got it yeah I (104:20 - 104:26)
think it was a January one (104:23 - 104:29)
mhm um (104:26 - 104:32)
so (104:29 - 104:35)
yeah I I mean I do think that they're (104:32 - 104:37)
probably that those sorts of ones are (104:35 - 104:39)
are like cuz like before 2013 they never (104:37 - 104:42)
did anything on Pokemon day anyway 2016 (104:39 - 104:45)
was the first ever Pokemon day yeah was (104:42 - 104:48)
it not did they not announce um X and Y (104:45 - 104:50)
on Pokemon Day in (104:48 - 104:51)
2013 (104:50 - 104:53)
uh am I misremembering I don't know when (104:51 - 104:55)
X and Y was announced but they they (104:53 - 104:57)
started celebrating Pokemon Day in 2016 (104:55 - 104:59)
because that was the 20th anniversary so (104:57 - 105:02)
before that was either like (104:59 - 105:05)
Nintendo or just like they they had (105:02 - 105:07)
Pokemon announcements but (105:05 - 105:11)
not day as a celebration it was January (105:07 - 105:13)
they announced T and Y so yeah yeah so (105:11 - 105:15)
for some reason they I like when they (105:13 - 105:17)
announced the sword and shield DLC which (105:15 - 105:21)
was 2020 they announced it in January (105:17 - 105:23)
that one was very weird cuz like that (105:21 - 105:24)
wasn't like oh we don't want to announce (105:23 - 105:27)
it yet why was it announced so yeah like (105:24 - 105:29)
a month before Pokemon that's weird yeah (105:27 - 105:31)
like what what was like it wasn't coming (105:29 - 105:32)
out till November or you couldn't wait (105:31 - 105:35)
another month like that was so weird the (105:32 - 105:37)
only thing I I guess is like maybe they (105:35 - 105:39)
wanted to make stockholders happy or (105:37 - 105:42)
something um but Pokemon day is still (105:39 - 105:45)
before the end of the financial year (105:42 - 105:47)
yeah yeah that why it was like whatever (105:45 - 105:49)
there'll be some there'll be some very (105:47 - 105:52)
weird Niche management (105:49 - 105:55)
