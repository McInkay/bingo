[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 390 third episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host SB j with me today we'll is back I'm back by week we will oh hey I don't have any Chappell plans so far for the month of February so I think yo you'll be able to hear me every week get not have to wait so long for your Pokemon of the week answers but I have to Annette announcements to make you ready I'm ready yeah I'm here I'm here also to stop this slander of my good name on your stream Steve your what what did he do what did he do he claimed that I have bad taste in movies cuz I went and saw cats twice I thought cats was wonderful and I saw it with you exactly not care about genes must are you looking for new hosts don't don't like cats don't wear fancy jeans garbage food must like McDonald's above all other things like I I'm here to stand on the hill that says I understand cats is not a great movie but it's an enjoyable one oh it says what a point out that greg equally liked Lion King he just put on the but equally hated Lion King he just put all the blame on me I like Lion King you're the one that was saying that it's an unoriginal story it is not original that's you your example is Hamlet and it is no way shape or form Hamlet well no because the Simba doesn't die at the end correct so somebody would have thrown herself in a pond you bring me that version of Lion King and that I'll submit to your Hamlet [Applause] we got a show today we got a lot of Pokemon Go news yeah we got some movie news Food Network made some Pokemon cakes a heck of a show which program did they make the Pokemon cakes on just to warn me Oh which one was it there's one of the cake challenges wasn't it as long as it wasn't like America's worst chefs or something like that where they like just do horrible things to ingredient who would network challenge I think is whoa that's a good show though I like it I've never seen it so I guess I'll have commentary you want to poke my goodies all the way yeah Pokemon go I can't tell if those sarcasm or not all right is it coming from will yes it is excuse me I am the pure-hearted honest young man oh all right the amount of lie is starting with a young sent in from James from our slack community this is off of the verge Pokemon goes live events drove nearly 250 million dollars in tourism revenue last year the antics says it's a our games are a boon for host cities of live events the real question is does my antic do what the Olympic does and leave the city in shambles on hit leave absolutely does is that what happens with the Olympics yes oh yeah oh dear in shambles so off the verge here in Natick labs says it's a live events for augmented reality are a hit with Pokemon go contributing 247 million dollars in tourism across three cities last year the announcement on Wednesday paired with the schedule for 2020 events including Pokemon go ingress prime and Harry Potter wizards unite Harry Potter Wizards unite still a game hey you guys were playing it for a bit yeah Natick says its biggest revenue generator was last year's Pokemon go fest in Chicago which drove a hundred and twenty million dollars in tourism spencer's from attending players across 64,000 attendees across attending the four-day event annie antic has greatly improved the live event infrastructure in the year since and its events now largely go off without any issues another pokemon go fest was the one in the German city of Dortmund which drew more players there was 86 thousand attendees at Dortmund but it only generated six only sixty million dollars in tourism revenue how did they calculate I just how do you know that one dollar would that was spent was tourism revenue versus somebody else who came in for like a business meeting that would probably be up to the city right cuz the city the cities all the cities are normally always looking for events and then oh I would assume that Chicago knows because it rents out those parks and then they can set the price to bid for those parks based on yeah but tourism revenue means like all the money that the tourists spend in the restaurants and everything like that not necessarily the the renting of the park it's like what money are they making off of tourists coming to their city right right but like Jeb Cod knows that too cuz like didn't jetan can say if oh yeah he knows it because Indianapolis is like boy we were making zero dollars for the month of August and all of a sudden we're making like five dollars because that must be Gen Con imagining that they have a baseline of normal tourism and factor what has gone above and beyond that for that time period like the middle of summer is not a huge business trip or Chicago Tourism time well there's no such thing as Chicago tourism so that's it right there isn't it why would anybody people make different life choices well speaking of events this is a Pokemon go live.com January 22nd trainers the year of 2009 featured an incredible lineup events for Pokemon go from welcoming trainers to three Pokemon go fests across three different continents to hosting our first ever Safari Zone in they'll Singapore in Canada every year we aim to go bigger and better than last year in 2020 you can look for two more ways we will capture your wallets in more locations I made up the wallet part we are pleased to announce our first-ever events this year number one the tois the Taiwan a lantern festival in Taichung City number two st. Louis Missouri safari zone number three Liverpool UK Safari Zone and number four Philadelphia Pennsylvania Safari Zone which i think is in May which is only the first five months of the year so I would assume there will be more Safari zones at a later date so the non ticketed special citywide event of the Taiwan Lantern City festival will take place Thursday February 6 to Sunday February 9th that actually starts on you twos birthday here Pokemon will appear a bill a Pokemon appearing will include the electric-type pokémon mareep and Electrike Volpe - a bug type Pokemon known for illuminating the skies will be appearing throughout the city along with illumise a a bug type Pokemon that guides will be to draw patterns there's actually a cute scene with those two in detects Pikachu the game at the end where they're lighting up a festival illumise a is typically only available in North America South America and Africa so locals may want to catch it while they have a chance they can also catch unknown el to celebrate the light themed event and they can also enjoy the lovely sounds of Chimecho the wind chime Pokemon so not ticketed for that event starts actually relatively soon so I don't know if anyone's scrambling to grab tickets to taichung city but if you need something to do I guess there it is celebrating the culture of but this is wise mantak lying to us celebrating the culture of Missouri safaris on st. Louis I hmm maybe the culture of like cry why st. Louis was nice the last time we were there is not st. Louis right now number one-ranked for crime over I'm pretty sure it's even higher than Chicago at this point I don't pay attention to those things so I have no I have to look it up all right you look at me I'll tell you what you can expect in the culture of Missouri we are excited to have our first ever safari zone this year take place in st. Louis Missouri the culture hub of music sports in beautiful parks will be home to st. Safari Zone st.

dollars which is a little different than Pokemon go fest I think Pokemon go fest was ten to six was it not I don't it definitely didn't start at 12 unless I'm misremembering I know Pokemon go fest the early access was like 8 to 6 and then normal access was ten to 6:00 yeah I think it's the way that went yeah people are jumping to the fact that teddiursa might be shiny here just based off the fact that it they seem to mention it trainers can encounter manky already shiny unknown s teddiursa Snivy and frost seed throughout the park Liverpool ready here sales the UK's first ever safari zone will be taking place in the beautiful waterfront of Liverpool enjoy this ticket of event in a magnificent 235 acre Sefton Park from Friday April 17th to Sunday April 19th during this Maori time themed

that City Philadelphia or Liverpool right it's Philadelphia that's what I said you said Philadelphia keep saying del though the Philadelphia better Philadelphia yes Bell Bell mice think of think of the Wisconsin Dells okay you wanna fill with water Phil Adele Villa del alright alright alright I hear you know Pokemon uh announced for that so yeah let's talk about this it's a lot nothing about Pokemon go fest I don't think they can walk away from Pokemon go fest because I think the branding around Pokemon go fest is very strong is they're contracting they're contractors chicago is done yeah I think they can walk away from it I think I think I think they got to do one more and then I they just commit to Safari zones but I think the safari zone brand internationally is is a lot stronger stronger than go fest cuz go fest was just us well angry I don't know our thinking they're not gonna walk away from Dortmund we don't know we don't know if that contract is up yeah but that was a safari zone no that was a girl fest there was three go PES last year one would be the only have go fest in Europe now maybe I just think their summers are too strong and they did go out of their way to say that Chicago made 120 million dollars in revenue I wouldn't be surprised if Chicago tries to get another one to two years out of them because I don't think they just walked away from that contract and said yeah we're good I'm sure Chicago was like do you want another year or two mean Chicago might but that doesn't mean that they want I mean Chicago's expensive yeah and like stringer was really expensive and I unless Chicago really gave them a super super super sweet deal I don't know that they're gonna want to say oh because of history we'll go back there like I don't I don't see a lot of with these uploaded upfront I think they will want to do more events around the u.s. in smaller venues that probably don't cost as much I think so too but here's a thing these events didn't send that a sellout go fest sells out that's that's actually the surprising thing to me is that you know tickets one on sale at 8:00 and not like 11 o'clock you could still get tickets yeah but I think the bigger question is did the two locations sell more even though they didn't sell out then one Chicago oh I'm well I'm well the other tickets are on sale but I'm sure I mean this is what we said on the podcast before is like why keep doing one location when you could do multiple locations and make even more money and if you don't sell out then great I just don't think I just think that go Fest is look I'm not advocating for go fest I think this way is better I just think that they would do go fast as they like okay here is an all-day thing here is the thing that sells out this is like the the the Super Bowl the WrestleMania the Olympics of our year and we use this to kick off our our summer and their summer is always very very good like I suspect after summer in like September October they will have an event in like the Portland area or the Seattle area or the California area because that area seems to be forgotten about I mean they have one in the middle of the US st. Louis and they have one on the East Coast Pennsylvania man if they have one in Portland I'm in I'm going really I love Portland yeah oh absolutely that was on my list of cities I could have moved to Portland is beautiful it is I'm sure there will be another one in South America I'm sure Australia will get one I wouldn't be surprised if they try India Japan will obviously have something over Pikachu outbreak there's more than one place in Europe so I completely suspect them to do a lot more safari zones I'm just curious of like I feel like they have to do one more year of go fest just because like they didn't say they were done with it and it does really kick off their summer which is the most successful they've ever been is during the summer now I think though fest is dead that's my prediction I think go Fest has a mixed history so like people still report about the disastrous first go fest I would think that they'd be like you know what we're just gonna leave that behind like we did we did a good one we had a bad one let's just good ones one bad one I can definitely see maybe they go like hey instead of go fest we're doing two safari zones at the same time one in Chicago one in Houston I could see them doing that and these are a little bit more special because they're gonna kick off our summer how are they gonna distribute Shaymin or mythical Pokemon they distribute at these events speaking of changing things up the other thing they've announced here is Community Day make your voices heard trainers Community Day is a key piece of what makes Pokemon go a unique gaming experience it's an event that encourages all trainers to go out and play one day a month and we've ended multiple days a month you force us to play together Pokemon go and we venomously spend time with my friends how dare you we and mostly inspired that by impact it had on building local communities to allow community to live up to its name we were letting trainers everywhere vote on the next pokemon what uncle chewy sure you are I believe this voting is next weekend you will vote by collecting research tests and then completing the research tests if you don't want to vote for a specific Pokemon they to delete their task and find another task and they said that they will fairly spread out the tasks and whatnot so it's a limited number of candidates there's four I have all four here for you I thought I could vote for any Pokemon no I have four nine I have four for you the 2020 february community candidates here we go number one Vulpix okay number two please number my job nothing all right what do you want for me what do you want me from the arm stealer we know top the whole line is bad what do you want what about Rhyhorn no bad boring all right can I win you over with a little dread teeny already did it yeah No all these are bad except yes the vocals I guess Vulpix wins yeah okay oh my god I just blinded that if any of these win I can probably skip community yeah although big news big changes at the Mall of America what so previously there was a rumor that they were going to start removing stops for Mall of America because Mall of America didn't want Pokemon go play brutal in there didn't want all of our business buying you know uncooked cookie dough and ice cream and exercise how the tables have turned for now that very Moll is encouraging people to come per community today and businesses are starting to offer Community Day specials well well well now the tables have turned so Mall of America can go by mall America go fest 20 Tony 20 burning yeah it's indoors when you buy a ticket you're restricted to a floor third floor there's water pride on the needles right I don't want that no no no I want the spongebob rollercoaster or The Fairly OddParents rollercoaster neither you get TMT or nothing well yeah Bubble Guppies or nothing there's no Bubble Guppies Oh Bubble Guppies is there at the mole oven oh yeah where where it's like some ant I don't even know what a Bubble Guppies oh but there's a new fancy M&M store coming where the American Girl doll store used to be so we're gonna get all sorts of wild M&M flavors now it's very exciting there this is the the for Pokemon here are not randomly picked look nacho Niantic makes a lot of bad Asians we've already established that I would assume that a lot of their decisions are probably uh throttled by the Pokemon company because they have to get pretty much everything approved through the Pokemon company international but they didn't just randomly pick for Pokemon out of the available 500 Pokemon available like will said some of these Pokemon have existed before like dratini so I want to go through this and point out the logic here because at the end of this I think it I think Greg's right I don't think it matters who wins because they're all four of these were picked for a reason Yantic is going to do the Niantic thing which is going to be will see a press release in a week or a month that'll say trainers we're so proud that you went out there and give voted because of your because of your dedication we're gonna give you all four of these they're gonna do something like that cuz they always do cuz yeah me antic and researched things you don't you vote on don't actually matter cuz I'll never actually release the results it's already decided I'm not gonna go into their special moves or whatnot they all have special moves but let's start with ball picks alone when Vulpix is already available as a shiny but regular Vulpix is not so there's there's two reasons why ball picks is added to this list the number one reason is ball picks is a very popular pokemon it has a lot of merchandise in the pokemon center a little in Vulpix and full picks are quite a duo now but more importantly knee antic is using this pokemon to test if people are okay with a two-stage pokemon Vulpix into nine tails no third evolution ooh so that's why Vulpix is originally picked now you could say well Pikachu existed and that's true because peach well peaches use three but peaches locked in eggs you can do the default answer of Pikachu doesn't count because it was the first one and it's Pikachu very hard to compare any Pokemon - Pikachu okay so that's why Vulpix is on this list very popular they're testing to see if people are okay with not having a three-stage evolution I think the answer is obvious yes Vulpix is one of the people one of the pokemon that is very vocal on Reddit and Twitter of want to win number two is Machop the obvious Machop is one of the best fighting-type pokémon in the game but the reason Machop is on that list is one because of that but number two is because machop's shiney is already available so what this means is in the antic is testing to see if somebody if are the community is okay with a community day of a pokemon that is already available in the shiny this matters for a couple reasons one because eventually they're going to run out of shiny pokemon right like the drip through the drip feed of shiny pokemon is catching up with itself we're almost through Gen 5 I hate to break it to people gen 7 and Gen 6 7 & 8 have a very small pool of Pokemon compared to Gen 5 in the previous gen very true and we're getting we're getting near the end so Machop Machop SHINee has been available but this pokemon is on the list because it is the one of the best in gyms and raids and it's already shiny sony antic is testing that specifically if people are ok with that now ride horns on the list for the same reasons as Machop it's very good in raids and gyms but it's shiny is not available it is a three-stage evolution that requires a sin o stone we already know that people are ok with that they did but that with swine hub the swine hub and with Ralts but more importantly Rhyhorn is very readily available for anyone in a ground biome it's it's the Pokemon on the list that is not shiny but also doesn't come from a tent keg so the antic is testing that to see if people are ok with a pokemon that wouldn't be as rare you know prior to community days it was almost impossible to find a dirty knee it was almost impossible to find a role to rebelled them now they did kind of do that with swine hub but you could maybe argue that the reason swine up got featured is because it was the year the pig but this is why Rhyhorn is on the list and you could see them doing that with wheedle or spheal you know these Pokemon that are very common but we don't specifically have Chinese of yet and then the last one is the biggest tell of why this list is created again none of these four were specifically they weren't they just didn't throw them in a bucket and then puke them out and say well these are the four we got dratini is on the list to prove can they repeat another community can we take a Pokemon that we did almost two years ago and can we recycle it again dratini is extremely popular you don't really find in the wild if you hatch a lot of 10k eggs of course you're gonna get a lot of Shruti knees but that's not who community is targeting community is targeting people who will go out maybe spend four dollars and get everyone together the antek doesn't care about the people who get a million dirty knees or already caught a million dirty knees on Community Day because those people are going to spend money even if they whine and pout that they've had this community before it's very clear that that a lot of players we're not playing when dratini community came around so again at a certain point they're going to run out of shiny pokemon to add and they're going to have to recycle community days or recycle like with a Machop situation miss Pokemon is already shiny can we do a community day for it because they got to do 12 a year so that's why dratini is on the list did there any prove they can redo them with the last community day in December which was all of them yeah but those are always like nobody places because it's Christmas yeah no one plays it and the odds are the odds are not nearly as high on those days I think instead of mourning 25 years an extension variety or like 170 or something I I think all of these will eventually be community days this year I don't think Snivy is going to be March Jen 5 is not even six months old yet by the time we got the Jen for starters it was already 11 months in the game if they were to do Snivy in March and then Tepig in Tepig in May and then osawa in July then we're done with Jen five starters and Jen six starters wouldn't even be out yet for those that are like well the pattern of they always rotates burners the pattern would either end now of they they hold back on Snivy and they don't give it to you in March I mean it's possible they'd the they do snappy in March but it's going to end and Gen 6 won't be out yet and then what are they supposed to do at that point they're not gonna give you fennekin right away because they need to artificially make something rare for like six months and then give it to you after that right that's like what they live there there's an artificial rarity and go and after a year that Pokemon is no longer right here and they move on to the next one there's there's not a situation though going back to this community there's not a situation here where Vulpix wins and they go well I guess we'll never give Rhyhorn a community day never going to do that no but they will because we voted for it don't you understand if we all don't do those we have control over their release schedule it's direct feedback five head Machop evolve Machop intima champ using the exclusive move payback there's not going to be a situation ever where Machop doesn't get payback they've already pretty much guaranteed that whether it's this event or a future event they're gonna give Machop payback I like for me it doesn't matter what wins I wouldn't be surprised if continued wins because again I think people are under estimating the amount of casual people that don't specifically care about whether something is good or not a lot of people just really like Dragonite and if they started playing literally any time after the dratini community day and they don't spend money on incubators they probably don't have a lot of dratini and I can't remember the last time I found her tini in the wild that wasn't maybe like a one-off event where they did for a weekend where dratini spawned I mean unless you're counting those like octo are that December kamini day stuff but even then there wasn't that many dratini - that's what I think I think that like all of the aya I don't think there's a guaranteed winner in this batch even though people might point to the obvious of it being Rhyhorn because it's not shiny and it's a good attacker I just I'm voting for Vulpix I don't care I just use a little cutie yep last bit of news is the lunar event is happening now and there will be a Mitch Min Chino community today when you're listening to this on Monday it would be the upcoming Sunday it would be on what was that February 2nd I think February 2nd yep let's take a break when we come back we have some Pokemon cake and some global linked news we will be right back [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this was sent in by Gabe up from our attic channel in slack off Kotaku the Pokemon cakes episode of Food Network challenge is a glorious mess in last night's episode of the competitive cooking show Food Network challenge for professional Baker's needs to be a big asterisk there attempted to create cakes resembling popular Pocket Monsters you make a squirtle cake in two hours in the first round of the new episode which is available on Food Network's website bakers were given two hours to create edible versions of Pokemon characters once completed the creations would be judged by a panel of baking experts and one competitive competing Baker would be eliminating via a remaining three would go on to round two building another Pokemon to face off in the battle scene oh it's very obvious who will lost the first round will describe to me this sob --all all right this apple doesn't look too bad compared to some of the other ones I mean it looks like a sob well maybe the head's a little too big but a lot of what's that stuff called bond' icing a fondant that you're not supposed to eat you don't want to but you can yeah but it's sitting on a lily pad that's that's I applaud their innovation for having to stop Alana literally pad like that not sure what the little fin on the top of its head is made out of that's that's definitely different certainly it's real lucky but losing rail blocking didn't didn't do so good on the on the hands of the feet I like how its head comes to like a complete like 90 degree angle yep yep it's got just two little pokes in the front for his nose like just look Gregg described as Litton to me okay have you ever seen a doll made from 1800s yeah basically it's like a sack filled with sawdust with arms stretched straight out it kind of made me think of Gumby baby of Goliath Davey and Goliath Gumby and Davey those are probably more animated in this monstrosity the head is pretty good like they got they got the head good but I also one whisker coming out of its I was here coming out of its eye the head is also not the right size for that body which my learned from Katz the movie is a problem maybe they just got done seeing cats they were inspired they are inspired to make this I mean this is not a Jellicle it's not the delicate choice I'll tell you that much I mean all all the all the pieces are there it's unhappy that's for sure yeah and it definitely has a whisker coming out of its eyeball why wouldn't you make a linen that was on all four legs rather than trying to make one standing up cause it's gonna fight just letting this her fight no yeah I don't know cuz don't you with like these cakes don't cheese wires on the inside yeah there are bid so there is you - yeah - like that and they probably use rice krispies to make all these things that cake is a real stretch of them you know what probably the most disturbing about the little one is the fact that the whiskers actually look like another set of baby doll arms yeah that is that is probably the most well described this beautiful chikorita I'm looking at the chikorita I think is the worst of them all they they didn't put the little necklace on it at all I don't think that was the perfect [Music] the its it's just not the right proportions I feel like they pulled up a picture of bay leaf and chikorita they didn't know there was a difference between the two yeah yeah welcome to Bay Arita it's like Chikorita was evolving and they like jammed on the B button real quick and then made a kick out of it and the hind legs are no it looks like they started making a brontosaurus and when that's not right it has a leaf on its head it also looks like its stomach is about to puke out all the inward innards yeah yeah not puke it's more like alien facehugger that kind of thing than a out of the body yeah the eyes are cute the the sob of the Litton and the Chikorita went against a very very well done Mudkip that also except the Mudkip is grotesque well good it squirts water hey Joe nobody needs a cake that squirts it first look only in Europe do they dip their cake into liquids our first you covered it being grotesque by calling it Mudkip second Oh innovative how they got it to squirt water by sticking a tube through it that's nothing its proportions are really good too yeah but also once again why is Mudkip standing on two legs this is a water gun you don't have to stand up to water gun I have used that move plenty of times okay so then round two went on time but it doesn't say here but I'm pretty sure the chikorita lost these other pictures number two Greg described to me this Pikachu so it's a it's the new version of Pikachu it's much thinner it's jumping through a hoop for some reason and instead of actually having hands they gave it to tasers they really did give it like they gave me today so I was but going to be charitable and that they were fireworks shooting out of its hands but no that's a piece of electronics this works yeah it's there too Tasers it's got no hands it's guy do Tasers why it's mouth is just like there's just something disproportionately wrong about that we're like the mouth and the cheeks and the it's uh and it's not the worst let's be honest so Pikachu you know the world looks like a Pikachu that's gonna tase ya made by the Mudkip girl yeah I'm concerned that they have the water squirting hand tase hand like where did she get the water and like did she prep this did she like know that she was gonna make Pikachu and she brought it know everybody they just basically use sugar so for sugar sculpting you have the big plunger that you put the sugar in and then you can you can put it into tube so that it hardens easy so you can sculpt sugar so there's basically just use the existing candy making apparatus just shove a tube up mudkip and have that shoot water out they just use that like those are fairly common baking supplies for decorating yeah but the fireworks I don't think is a fairly the fire I'm not sure she pulled the Taser from apart from maybe like her belongings like I'll just attach the Taser here we'll can you describe the squirtle well I mean it's very happy ah it kind of resembles the rainbow squirtle book cover yeah kind of uh tales wrong it's about twice the size of Linton's gone baby if we make it bigger it'll be easier to sculpt I'm sure the shell is submerged underwater I'll be charitable it is submerged under the wave that it's coming behind the squirtle it's clearly summoning surf it's like a giant surfing wave to come crush this tiny little creepy nineteen hundred's doll Lytton scary looking but the best for last because I from what I can tell us they all had to be doing some sort of attack like they all had to do something yeah I don't think as of this recording the final episode is aired yet because we went from four to three and then I would assume it would go to three - yeah but they're different they have a different challenge every week so it depends on which way they usually eliminate a second and then they do a third Rawdon and who declare the winner in a lot of them so it could be that there's one more thing they had to do well it doesn't say who made the Bulbasaur but I'm assuming it's the Saba person since Chikorita person definitely got knocked out most likely yeah unless they skipped what the samel person made and we're assuming that the Mudkip person made the bubble sir I mean all of these things look like they had to pick one that match the type weaknesses so I'm imagining that the bubble SAR was against the sambal and it shoots leaves which are very cute yeah it's really so this episode will be on today at 4:00 p.m. central for those of us who have the Food Network boy somebody won $10,000 for making one of these monstrosities yeah they did Bob Lazar is actually really good though yeah so this look I can see the whole Bulbasaur why is it suspended in the air like that sure the leaves shut itself up with vine whip so this looks like it is this the one where they all complete all in one show so there should be another challenge after this episode 3 is wizard of odds cakes which that looked like they did a much better job but I just said the way Food Network challenges yeah they finish the challenge every episode and then it's a different challenge so let the previous episode - this was Back to the Future cakes and then next week it's gay monopoly cakes that chikorita Baker should be very disappointed with themselves almost like the easiest Pokemon to do because it's just a stupid pair thing blob with a bunch of blobs are unjust next how did you go so wrong I'm telling you it looks like they pulled up a picture of bay leaf and didn't realize it was a different poke probably must have I think they the only thing easier would be to like to have made a dit oh yeah just a ditto cake but even if they did a bay leaf it into the necklace no I know that's that's got the body and all you have to do is take what are those like the little candies that I like the lime ones the green like green spice drops yeah just do that and a ring around the things neck done that show next time we have a year to learn how to bake oh you make the whole round things a circle circle cakes are hard look at how many heads they made magic cake or a circle cake what are you talking here no like like a lot of the Baker's got the circle shape right like Linton's head is good mudkips head is good this was my challenge is a charge of my I just III outside of this whole discussion of this particular I don't understand the whole I want a cake that's actually a sculpture I want a cake I can eat I want a sheet cake that I can grab by the fistful and shove down my throat and that is better be delicious then but no don't waste this is wasteful yeah but that's what weddings do they make a pretty cake that you won't eat and then there's like 50 sheet cakes in the back that they served ever and then they'd steal the cake and yeah that's true here's what they should have done this years all done Pokemon quests cakes cuz they're all square yeah they're really done and done I don't think some of them were educated in Pokemon he has a point to hurry to girl this was a relief this is sent in by Lance from our attic channel in slack off pokemon.com Mewtwo strikes back evolution on Netflix I so just to step this back a second this is the movie we were supposed to get in November of 2018 that everybody was like oh I guess we're not getting that movie right yep that yep okay this was the movie that did extremely well in Japan in Korea and never came to the United States let me read pokemon.com here start popping the popcorn now Greg and well all rights popped go to the store downstairs Laurie that specializes in popcorn as the latest Pokemon animated movie will soon be premiering as a Netflix original the CGI animated film Pokemon movie strikes bat Mewtwo strikes back or movie straights back whatever you want evolution is a reimagining of Pokemon the first movie which was originally released in North America 1999 the new might was a major hit when it debuted in Japan last year and became one of the top grossing films during the opening weekend there in pokémon Mewtwo strikes back evolution researchers discover and exploit max ray dents in order to get shiny pokemon oh hold on researchers discover and and exploit a fossil of the mythical Pokemon Mew unleashing a creation that goes against the very laws of nature Mewtwo a legendary Pokemon intended for a for use as a tool of destruction but NSU becomes aware of its own dubious origin it begins to resent its human creators and seeks revenge ash Pikachu and their friends find themselves at the center of its rampage Mewtwo's evolution will debut on Netflix February 27th Pokemon Day Oh in time for my anniversary if you're not following the what are they calling it the streaming wars right now Netflix is in losing I don't think they're losing I don't think they're losing Netflix is in a competition with like HBO and Disney right now and Apple those are probably the big four right Disney Apple HBO and Netflix because Disney onto Lu so I guess I hate saying Apple wait wait but about YouTube TV that's it doesn't make give up on original content oh oh you mean and create the weight buying a Pokemon movie is not original content no well I mean its original and the fact that literally the only place you can see it like that that in itself is exclusive content its exclusive concept it's not original content I'm curious of how long so it's it's not surprising to me that like this movie is coming to Netflix it's more interesting to me of like how long this was this deal was in the works because I'm sure Netflix probably paid a pretty penny for this not probably because this movie is going to be particularly good I mean the first meet like muties Mewtwo the first Pokemon movies not great it's fine what but it's like if everyone just took off their nostalgia glasses that movie you know I refuse to take off my nostalgia glass that's will be ant making that movie is like 20 minutes of Mewtwo at the end of all the Pokemon brainlessly fighting each other and then it's like all of this time waste of how Ash and company get to the island like a lot of people I think forget that part of the movie but this your your version of time wasting my version of time we serve vastly different that is a rich character background they spend so much time in like if there's not even a pokemons that it's like a warehouse it's like trying to decide how to get to this island you certainly remember this movie much differently than I do there's it's pretty it's a pretty boring movie the Pokemon companies we've learned one thing they're really good at making money so I'm sure they got paid very well by Netflix to have this movie on Netflix overall it's interesting that we didn't get this movie when we were supposed to because so back up the truck the Pokemon company okay so whether or not youth you you like to let's go Pikachu let's go Eevee let's go Pikachu let's go Evie was a a a game that used the gen7 engine so they didn't really have to remake an entire engine like they did for gen8 they needed more time with gen8 saw that the switch was finally successful and they figured that remaking pokemon yellow which is what let's go pikachu let's go Eevee is it's a remake or in their words a rematch a reimagining which they use here in Mewtwo strikes back so remake remaking reimagining pokemon yellow on the switch was the right choice so some would argue it was the right choice because Pokemon ko was an undeniable success those people are right some people would say it was they did it because people love Gen 1 which is undeniably true those people are right and then some people would say they only did this because they needed one game a year and those people are right as well there's no reason why the Pokemon company shouldn't put out one game of wait a year if it sells 11 million copies that's a lot of copies so all those people are right but on top of that it's there wasn't that wasn't a coincidence that they took the time like they didn't they didn't make let's go with the like oh we need to put something out like they all they planned let's go and they plan to remake the first Pokemon movie at the same time they like 100% knew what they were doing they were capitalizing on nostalgia and I'm Pokemon go player sure but that the the goal was we're going to put out a childhood favorite pokemon yellow and we're gonna put out the Mewtwo movie again which is also a childhood favorite at the same time and capitalize on that and they did that successfully in Japan but for whatever reason I don't know if they couldn't strike a deal with theaters because that movie would have done well here it would have done that I think definitely yeah it would have been been great I think a lot of people would have been like I love the first movie and now it's a CGI version of it heck yeah so that's that's the that's the like takeaway from this entire conversation is like I don't think we'll ever know what happened of like why this movie didn't make it to theaters like yeah sure Pokemon Day is a convenient time but I'm sure they they secured that deal a long time like I'm sure they secured that deal a couple months ago and they were like well let's just hold it to pokemon day because there was a Mewtwo distribution in let's go in Japan there was a mute then at one point we randomly got a me-too distribution in the UK and they decided to tie that in with a TCG release and then right before sword and shield came out they were like well we might as well give you guys your Mewtwo I guess Best Buy gave us some money so here's Mewtwo and let's go right before sword and shield came out which is fine but like you know they were saving the Mewtwo for this movie that never came out and I don't think a lot of people put two and two together like the reason they made that remade this movie was the same reason they remade let's go they were going to put them out at the same time together and it just again goes to show you that the Pokemon company is really good at hitting on all these cylinders that other companies aren't doing like they don't just brainlessly put out games or movies without this supplemental content to benefit each other they're really smart at this they're really good at this but for some reason this movie didn't make it out in the United States or anywhere else outside of Korea in Japan in 2018 it may be that they always distribute through the called yeah and that they may be phantom is not doing so good yeah I remember emailing phantom and I said like when are you guys doing tickets for this one this is coming and they were like oh we have we haven't heard anything from the Pokemon company about this movie yet so maybe that's where the rift is I mean they're still doing a lot of events I see their ads all the time Bantam yeah yeah but it may be that the Pokemon events weren't making that much money for him probably not enough to yep I know I know the power of us didn't do well in theaters but I choose you did because people like John won yep well once bitten twice shy there you go I got some sad news for you guys know what I'm fine with it this is off pokemon.com pokémon Global Link end of service announcement this is like uh news everybody thought it was dead five years ago no I used it every day for what I have no idea break out your tissues after more than nine years of operation the pokémon Global Link the pgl will terminate service on February 24th 2020 right now they are get it the pokémon Global Link website will also be retired at this time after pgl service has ended you will no longer be able to use any gameplay features that require connection to the pgl on your pokemon ultra sun your pokemon ultramoon your pokemon sun or your pokemon moon games you will still be able to use other online functionality apart from the pgl listed below so wait what what was ultrasound and ultra moon using on the pgl i will i will let you know please do let me know soared and pokemon shield will provide service services similar to the pgl rating battles and online competition features and will be available to play via the nintendo switch however note that a Nintendo switch online members in attendance which online in parentheses paid service is required to participate on long line competitions thank you for using the pgl and we hope you continue to enjoy pgl services until they end okay so this is what's gonna happen on February 24th keep in mind Pokemon home is supposed to come out in February no date but the Global Link shuts down on the 24th so I don't know I'm Pokemon days the 27th out and I'll pick a day in February probably around there maybe sooner alright so this is what's going to happen on the 24th three DS dot Pokemon - gee Elcom cannot be used that website will be defunct pgl login / new user registration out of the question link game software you better believe you won't be able to use that game's even know what that means game dancing unfortunately no more game sync game sync ID insurance uh uh that's gone free battle use it all you want doesn't require the pgl you want a battle against somebody's six shiny hacked Zehra aura more you're more than welcome the Pokemon company encourages it sweet rating battles out of the question how dare you no more ratings out of the question online competitions nope nope nope nope nope no no no no no no we're charging tonight now and it's endow paid online service you got to pay to the online compete no longer free out of the question friendly competitions don't kinda you're not allowed to use QR codes however you can use a code which you have saved for the image elsewhere so get your QR code scan now if you want to do that friendly online competitions via the internet I got two letters for you and oh no all right distribution regulations there's a triangle here that means warning information viewed via the pgl website cannot be viewed after the closure this function itself does not use the pgl so you can continue to use it oh I see what they're saying if you've downloaded the the regulation rules they can still be used you can't get new ones communication battles local Wireless can always be used safe safe - safe to trade this is the big one here communication trading G t s let's Greg's favorite way to trade yep it's the best nation viewed via the pgl website cannot be viewed after closure but this function itself does not use the pgl so it can be continued so it can continue to be used for the time being it's their actual words so GTS is safe same for wonder trade safe does not make use of the P in the p GL communication trading infrared will we can still trade locally nice thank goodness Q our rental teams QR codes can no longer be used however if you have saved QR codes you are fine don't delete them though battle videos this is not make use of the p GL so you are allowed to save your battle videos still that is everything that is happening when the p GL shuts down I hope no one listening to the show got a heart attack well I just need to output my records of like all my playthrough records that are stored on the p GL to a PDF and then i'll have them forever yep that's how you do it how will we know what the most petted Pokemon is the page that yeah I know if the pgl is shutting down its the sylveon I think it's still in center oh I think it was ever not in sinner or rip the pgl was not great it wasn't terrible horrible I mean is better than a lot of things it was it was definitely restricting in in the sense of like competitions and distributions right like if you wanted to participate in the everyone hatch a million eggs you had to go to the pgl first link your game talk to the lady in the festival Plaza for her do you think that's what I was going to say that the way that they made it work was a bit clunky sure like there are a lot of steps they were very very protective of their free service for children so yeah there are some clunkiness to it but once you knew how to do it it wasn't terrible is is the new way easier sure you're also paying 20 bucks for it so now you know where your money went I would I would always pay $20 for convenience well so the my issue is the nice thing about the pgl was there was a one website that you could go to and then you can see like all your records you can see about competitions and all your milestones and everything were uploaded there I mean a lot of people didn't know that they could look there to see their milestone it's like and I don't know if there's a website like a corresponding website any longer huh come on home you may be getting a lot of promises about Pokemon home and when they don't deliver I'm gonna be real sad okay that's my that's my jam making you're real sad for the promises 306 million Pokemon as of this recording traded via the GTS in the Sun and Moon games Wow an ultra 306 million and then there's a picture of Papa Leo so I think actually what they're saying is through mommy only on Papa Leo got traded Pokemon refresh number one is in center or still yeah I guess that's like kind of the weird thing with sword and shield is like I'm at the pgl right now I can see the most used QR teams for double battles that's available here they all include Landorus spoiler I can see the raiding battles for trainer ratings of all matched formats I can see somebody's Japanese name they have 7,000 points spoiler they're all Japanese names except for this one person named son I can see some news look the GDL was real garbage you know how hard it was to redeem and sign up for those top ooh cocoa topple Ella events did not make it clear not hard no it was like four clicks oh no the more click and that's that's if you got the four clicks like if you if you knew exactly where to click look it took me forever to get my Munna because when you click on the like notification Munna is here it takes you to a different web page which explains it to you but doesn't tell you how to get it yeah that sounds about right for the gloomy cuz it's like oh you click the raw you were supposed to click the Lugg the mini text in the upper left hand corner it was it was fine a like 9 years is way too long to keep a single system true I mean think of how many games we've gone through in those nine years that it's been supporting like six hopefully Pokemon home has something I hope so it's gonna have all these great records doesn't tell you how many shinies you got how many raids you did how many friends you have to be probably any shuffle as you shuffled it's gonna be all of your home stuff all the home it's a home of home ok let's take a quick break and we'll end with Pokemon of the week and question of the week we will be right back [Music] [Music] last bit of news here pokemon TCG a lowland sand /gx box now available it includes one promo card of a little insane /gx one oversized promo card for booster packs and a code card for the Pokemon Trading Card Game on line not a sword and shield but it's if you love sandslash if they put on a box is it good oh I don't think it's particularly dirty spikey shield if this Pokemon is your Active Pokemon and is damaged by an opponent's attack even if this pokemon is knocked out put three damage counters on the attacking Pokemon oh and it has frost breath for a blue and two colorless but they got rid of double colorless energy right yeah yeah for 120 and then it's got a GX it in the pokémon Global Link left together Wow spikey storm GX this attack does 100 damage to each of your opponent's Pokemon that has any damage counters on it bummer show doesn't sound good but if you combine it with something that does like spreads damage and moves damage around sure it looks like oh I'm seeing from the picture yeah - cosmic eclipses those are good unified minds also good but I can see back there upper left they're sticking in a pack of steam Siege good not good like not everything can be winners Oh as somebody who is still bitter about getting three Crimson Invasion cards at the Pokemon world championships you're absolutely right we all can't be winners here I guess me possibly the worst three booster packs that was printed in the last two years crimson invasion is like ice I have it's been seven months I've still not opened those packs because they're worth at least three dollars sealed there were nothing if I open them that way who are you gonna sell them to look I gotta let them age next to my ancient mute Greg hopefully one day buzz well GX will shine again I pity your great-grandchildren who gonna be like we got this box of useless cards from our ancestor burned them for fuel oh man hold on crimson invasion I'm trying to find a single eyes crimson invasion booster pack three dollars and 11 cents on TCG yep yep there and I think buzz will buzz swell GX is worth like 350 maybe and B string is like 80 cents and those are the two best cards from that set let me see what does s the best most expensive card in the set right now on page one two are there only two pages I got to look at it differently I'm apologize Wow how old is Christmas crimson invasion a little over a year I want to say because it has dropped off of the main TCG yeah it rotated it did rotate it as of August there we go it's part of the Sun and Moon seriously yep yeah here we go price high too low it's not that old okay so there was a secret water energy in twenty one dollars and seventy eight cents a secret Gyarados GX is 1805 while the water energy is worth more than the gear but you can have these in there there's not a lot of reasons why lol and Sam / should get its own box it's not like well aren't loose I mean you know it's not like like they're doing any lol on science / promotion and movies or TV shows or games I feel like the only reason I do this is they're like how can we reach I can we've sell these booster packs again has a packs of Steve's each lying around how can we get rid of and we need to get rid of them so I want to do some more research on this the because I skipped all of the X&Y series because I left the TCG when plasma freeze and all the plasma cards started flooding the markets when that was black and white - but the X and y is what introduced mega evolution and near the end of the X&Y set they produced a a set called X&Y evolutions which was a reprinting ironically this camera this came out around Pokemon go it was a reprinting of the the base set so like Charizard and chauncey and all the original cards got reprinted and slightly modified they were all still bad but except I think the Mewtwo is okay but they reprinted that and I guess they probably expected because of Pokemon go that these cards would sell well because of nostalgia but there are still to this day including XY evolutions in like hidden in tins like when you go to the store and you're like ah they got a new tin of Sun and Sun and Moon or sorry likes I'm sure when the sword and shield stuff comes out I'm confident that they will somehow find a way to stick XY evolutions behind all those other cards so you're like oh cool 6 booster packs for sword and shield of seems stage and XY evolutions uh uh you know honestly I would take steam siege over crimson invasion steam some dinners have like mega and something I don't know and had something in it just open your packs and catch open your packs catch the throw look it's like a loot box you don't want to open the bad loot boxes what do you how do you know if it's a bad loop box until you open it yeah this is a good point it's like stroke open I know we didn't talk about this we got to talk about this real quick okay they released Darumaka in Pokemon go your the rad all the red pokemon they're restricting it to 7k eggs you know not only that but they decided to make more red pokemon up here in 7k eggs so not only do you have to open 7k eggs for dar maka they put Wurmple Vulpix shuckle in 7k eggs alongside it you have any Vulpix I'm seeing and you expect me to walk seven kilometers to possibly get another Vulpix that's all yeah did you get a party hat work well yeah I did I got two of lokay cuz Greg and I both have them at least party hat Worple was cute there is not a fiber in my body that wants to buy incubators for Daraa mukha well then don't buy incubators just I'm not one that I'm making a stand though here's the thing about the one you give me let me tell you what happened let me let me okay so I have I have my one free incubator and it's it's incubating a 5k egg let me tell you my others eggs 5k egg 5k egg 5k egg I have another five keg and a 5k egg I have a look I have six five kegs right now let me tell you what's in them all garbage by the time I get through maybe four of these 5k eggs this event will be over so either I wrote them away and just get seven keys I can't throw it you can't throw eggs you gotta hatch them well I mean I can hatch two five K's a day with minimal effort so okay look mr. legs some of us sir legs okay some of us don't leave our house some of us don't move very much from home I literally most of my specialty live on for 18 five and you gotta walk down all these stairs that's at least 2 7 k eggs a flight don't count no stairs count I'm almost positive stairs count for hatching eggs you're walking it right in a circle it's like now you're cheating the system yeah maybe adds it adds steps to I I am just saying at least partyhat Wurmple could have been shiny and at least there was other decent things and there's not a lot of decent things in some cakes but you could have got like full pics a little in Vulpix you could have got I don't know there's a couple other things you could have gotten better you gonna be when I get my dirt Darumaka you could have got like shiny ugly buff but the fact that they took out all the baby Pokemon and then put in Vulpix and chuckle and Wurmple ah this is this might be the worst thing they've done maybe not the worst it's an antic but it's it's okay I will wait and our maka alright question Louie how do magikarps jump so very high coulda Beedrill really fly thoughts like these they all could be question of the we well that was lovely although I'm can I put in a bid for some Cole Porter please yep you got it do you have a favorite I feel of is always good from a kiss me kate got it Patrick writes in and says if the host of the podcast were characters in Pokemon masters who would be your partner pokémon will Victini dick no you can't have a legendary mythical hey Ken oh yeah Giovanni is me too yeah well I don't think anyone has a mythical Pokemon yet isn't so Glee oh no it's legendary legendary hmm I still stand the first one added in first one that wait will what would you have besides Victini what would be your what be your non legendary non mythical Pokemon that you would want people to represent you by to associate vileplume vileplume does somebody have that already I think Erica does yes yes it took me about I know gardenia took my Rosa read some could get a florges yeah I don't think anyone has florges although I wouldn't Trevor get florges if they ever introduced Trevor Trevor's the red hair kid right he is completing his pokedex did he not have florges or my misremembering action why somebody when you fight somebody on the bridge near the end of that game I know the story is riveting and X&Y he was like six years ago nobody has one of your 18 friends and X&Y one of them has florges well I mean one of them has one of every Pokemon it's like I got to get there first oh really there was Trevor Abra bombie can I have her bombie no that's uh wait what do you have to have no Mina is great I'm not a hundred percent sure why actually no you can you can ever bomb B yeah you can have because I'm Mina didn't take it for some weird reason oh yeah that's that that choice is weird great what would you have well I can't pick Rose rate yep makes me angry so I am going to go with Bolton okay all right all right all right yeah I don't think any sword and shield character would have now I'm gonna take it as my good good dog oh okay all right I think mine's easy if masculine no yep those de Meyer he's the first to star sig fair he's gonna have cram brand yeah would be the crash man I love you cram did you see that gif of like the doll for gym battle with for cranberry oh my gosh the Pokemon company producing really amazing retweet about content out there I wish I could do that I did the Gaillard newcomers I just picked six random Pokemon just to get my loss from my 50 battle points I was very satisfied even though I lost very quickly that I was able to dive with Mike rammer and get a fish in my mouth and then shoot it out before my as I died you didn't get the Pikachu the fingers uh yeah I didn't get picture I got the Barrett barracuda Barracuda it was good though I died a noble death uh yeah my would be the crime rant if I couldn't pick crime rant I think I would watch I'm echo I had to do like a non gen8 Pokemon I would do Chimecho my Chimecho Oh Mike oh it's lucky I mean I like Chimecho too but I was like budget Jirachi alright well poke one of the week is going to be awful uh Ireland our last Pokemon of the week it wasn't a Pokemon [Music] and it was about a resident of anistar city so you had to think about anistar city with the Trinity of sigilyph sigilyph whatever you want to call it slow king meowstic female and they are known for their cloak with a star-filled pattern and a bracelet that can hold two wrists and they had a TCG card that worked like switch except it healed whatever Pokemon was sent to the bench who's that being it's bronzong uh not a Pokemon it's less yeah bras I was like a bell it's Olympia I don't know what had me thinking about Olympia two weeks ago but there was some reason why Olympia yeah the gym leader from a Star City know what she is do you yeah she had a pretty decent gym yeah did she appear in the enemy right did several times did she the thing was yeah well she had like a very like I'm like outer space see otherworldly over a kind of voice but the main thing in the anime was she had one vision of ash greninja and then she also had a vision about what was going to happen with zygarde but also what was cool was because the mega evolution specials were simultaneous to that season of the X&Y anime she had a vision about Groudon and Kyogre and she told Kalos they gave them the information so that they could protect themselves from that a particular event as it was occurring so there you go apparently she speaks almost entirely in haiku yeah in Japanese does she not do that in the English Channel it's harder to make haiku in English so no in the game not not in the anime the anime she just spoke oh okay getting the dress in haiku her what would her band poke my master's thing be meowstic right yeah yeah yeah but chef is not as gen5 right yeah you have to like it's outside of her job I mean there any messed up Mina they absolutely way I'm gonna look at Mina she doesn't use a grand ball at all does she yes she does oh she sure does oh okay I don't remember the grand ball I'm hit mmm meowstic sure that's nothing should be sickened with okay when you battle her in Sun and Moon she's a klefki a grand ball Asha notic a Wigglytuff Andra bombi and the gauntlet battle is the same thing an ultrasound ultramoon she uses mall while Grand Ballroom ami pre Hall of Fame and let's go she's as jigglypuff and mr. mime and then post hall of fame she's as mr. mime Wigglytuff and a lowly nine tails if that's fairy ice yeah yeah yeah real good against dragons wish I had that in my battle against our lion remember yeah I don't remember the grand ball at all but okay it's pink no I know what grand ball looks like that's our that's our episode excuse me sorry Pokemon of the week well you surely off with the non Pokemon alright so this one is a Pokemon poke a mind so as I was leaving the gym this morning and had my music on shuffle a song by our

we uploaded episodes before I need to because people asked for it and then it didn't seem like people were listening so try it again last couple episodes have been on YouTube this will be on YouTube is will I'm gonna try to start cutting some content from streams obviously i stream everyday on Twitch which TV slash pkmn cast but you know some people want extra content but they also don't want to sit through a 6 hour stream so I'm gonna try to start highlighting some of the funny or educational or best content from the streams and moving it over to YouTube so even educational quoting so hard for that section let me teach you know about in center are no another reason so do the YouTube YouTube Instagram twitch Twitter all the same now piqué m-and-c AST all the same very easy so almost like it's like the name of the website went up like a hundred follows on YouTube since we started uploading these episodes so clearly I don't know somebody's somebody's listening to it on YouTube so thank you yeah also for some reason we have more patreon than we've ever had in the history of patreon so thank you we're almost at 450 unique patrons I don't think that we're yeah yeah we're just shy of 450 so thank you a ton a lot I feel like we don't do that enough that's on me but to anyone who has supported in the past or who is currently supported or even who was made it to the end of the

about Tim Tim we have not talked about Tim Tim I have played live I've talked I've talked about Tim time when I played it 6 months ago I haven't played it yet so it's gonna be a bit but I do think Tim
