reporting today and uh check out that (2:38 - 2:42)
new Toys R Us in Mall of America that (2:40 - 2:45)
just opened did I send you did I send (2:42 - 2:47)
you their Tik Tok of them saying our new (2:45 - 2:50)
flagship store is opening never guess (2:47 - 2:53)
where it is and I'm like it's America (2:50 - 2:55)
cuz I walked past it apparently it's two (2:53 - 3:00)
stories too yeah uh which seems okay (2:55 - 3:02)
okay uh if you guys don't know Toys R Us (3:00 - 3:03)
is still owned by the same company who (3:02 - 3:06)
filed who who closed them for bankruptcy (3:03 - 3:09)
yep which is what like JD Holdings or (3:06 - 3:11)
something like that yeah I don't I don't (3:09 - 3:13)
know what the plan is (3:11 - 3:16)
here to make a quick Buck for the (3:13 - 3:18)
holidays and then to close them again to (3:16 - 3:20)
close them all again yeah probably the (3:18 - 3:22)
company that owned the company that (3:20 - 3:25)
bought Toys R Us last minute and then (3:22 - 3:27)
squeezed every penny out of it before (3:25 - 3:30)
shutting it down is currently it's a (3:27 - 3:31)
it's a liquidation company that's all (3:30 - 3:33)
they do with other companies is they buy (3:31 - 3:36)
them they they extort as much money as (3:33 - 3:37)
possible and then they file for (3:36 - 3:39)
bankruptcy (3:37 - 3:42)
to whatever tax loophole that they go (3:39 - 3:46)
for they currently own GameStop if (3:42 - 3:48)
you if you're wondering what GameStop's (3:46 - 3:51)
future is going to be probably the same (3:48 - 3:53)
as Toys R Us (3:51 - 3:56)
y but there are toys are still in like (3:53 - 3:59)
Japan and Canada they are not owned by (3:56 - 4:01)
the same (3:59 - 4:04)
uh extortion company that they were here (4:01 - 4:06)
in the US so because it was it was Bane (4:04 - 4:09)
company which is Mitt Romney's company (4:06 - 4:12)
somebody else and somebody else because (4:09 - 4:14)
there were three all I remember is Bane (4:12 - 4:17)
Capital because it was Mitt R's (4:14 - 4:19)
company and then they were because they (4:17 - 4:22)
were owned by Macy's for a little (4:19 - 4:25)
while oh yeah they have like a long it's (4:22 - 4:28)
a that company's been passed around a (4:25 - 4:30)
lot cuz it used to be FAO Schwarz CEO (4:28 - 4:32)
ran it and (4:30 - 4:36)
then they split into baby and toys arest (4:32 - 4:39)
which was a bad idea because it really (4:36 - 4:42)
hurt your Toys R Us business and then (4:39 - 4:45)
Bane Capital somebody and somebody I (4:42 - 4:48)
should probably look that up uh whp (4:45 - 4:51)
Global is Who currently (4:48 - 4:55)
owns Toys R Us and they're reporting I (4:51 - 4:57)
guess our first bit of news is Toys R Us (4:55 - 5:00)
they're reporting 24 Flagship stores (4:57 - 5:03)
around the US they are planning some of (5:00 - 5:07)
these 24 stores to be on in (5:03 - 5:13)
airports or on cruise ships which I know (5:07 - 5:15)
there are some uh listeners that are (5:13 - 5:18)
very big in the the cruise ship scene I (5:15 - 5:20)
guess I've never been on a cruise ship (5:18 - 5:22)
because I I'm terrified of boats and I (5:20 - 5:25)
cannot swim so (5:22 - 5:28)
uh I I guess cruise ships have stores I (5:25 - 5:29)
didn't think of that but when I read (5:28 - 5:31)
that that kind of makes sense that they (5:29 - 5:34)
would have stores but I've oh yeah (5:31 - 5:35)
you're trapped there it's like an (5:34 - 5:40)
airport oh so whp company bought them (5:35 - 5:43)
bought that whole brand in 2020 (5:40 - 5:46)
something 2020 2019 so it's not the same (5:43 - 5:48)
people that liquidated them oh okay it (5:46 - 5:52)
did they did sell it has it has past (5:48 - 5:54)
hands the company came out of bankruptcy (5:52 - 5:56)
changed the name to True (5:54 - 5:58)
kids and (5:56 - 6:01)
then if you're buying something aren't (5:58 - 6:03)
you just buying it for the brand name (6:01 - 6:06)
look they buy it and then they Rebrand (6:03 - 6:08)
it and then they come out a couple years (6:06 - 6:09)
later when they think marketing's good (6:08 - 6:11)
to go back to the most recognized name (6:09 - 6:13)
like Hey we're back which is exactly (6:11 - 6:17)
what they're doing but true kids (6:13 - 6:19)
worked a lot with getting stuff into (6:17 - 6:21)
Target and Walmart and stuff which was (6:19 - 6:24)
their main primary competitors so it's (6:21 - 6:27)
interesting to sort of (6:24 - 6:27)
see where they're going with this (6:28 - 6:32)
anyways they've open they've been (6:30 - 6:34)
opening stores since (6:32 - 6:37)
2021 uh the next big one will be at Mall (6:34 - 6:39)
of America it won't last past the (6:37 - 6:41)
holidays because most things that open (6:39 - 6:44)
for the holidays in M of America do not (6:41 - 6:47)
last past the holidays at Mall of (6:44 - 6:51)
America I there there have been some (6:47 - 6:52)
stores in Mall of America where you're (6:51 - 6:54)
like wow you're you're you're you're (6:52 - 6:57)
still open wow you're a drug (6:54 - 6:57)
friend you're still you're still doing I (6:57 - 7:01)
think toys ARS will find Tom Marl (7:00 - 7:04)
America it will for the holidays and (7:01 - 7:07)
then you don't think it'll go past that (7:04 - 7:09)
there are there I mean that like board (7:07 - 7:10)
game store up there last that like (7:09 - 7:12)
puzzle store which is also owned by that (7:10 - 7:14)
board game store is still going I mean (7:12 - 7:18)
games by James just lives in malls like (7:14 - 7:22)
yeah the the Legacy toys place is still (7:18 - 7:25)
doing its thing they got a giant giraffe (7:22 - 7:26)
in there that you can take a picture of (7:25 - 7:28)
not to be confused with the toys toys is (7:26 - 7:31)
totally like hey remember when you used (7:28 - 7:34)
to think that playing with wooden horses (7:31 - 7:37)
was fun Legacy toys is here they got (7:34 - 7:40)
Pokemon Legacy (7:37 - 7:43)
toys they were I give it the same chance (7:40 - 7:45)
that the go calendar shop and the go toy (7:43 - 7:48)
shop has for lasting past the holidays (7:45 - 7:51)
getu that's like the Spirit Halloween of (7:48 - 7:54)
like go calendar is very much we need to (7:51 - 7:57)
sell calendars before the New Year's (7:54 - 7:59)
because that's our optimal calendar (7:57 - 8:03)
selling time is is before the year (7:59 - 8:05)
changes over they're very (8:03 - 8:09)
strategic it's again it's like Halloween (8:05 - 8:11)
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah in and (8:09 - 8:14)
out I have very fond memories of toys (8:11 - 8:16)
Rus because that was (8:14 - 8:17)
where (8:16 - 8:21)
um that was where I I actually as a (8:17 - 8:24)
child socialized with other children (8:21 - 8:26)
when my parents would take me there and (8:24 - 8:28)
then try to like hassle the kids for (8:26 - 8:31)
good trades I wasn't allowed to trade my (8:28 - 8:32)
parents didn't think I was smart enough (8:31 - 8:35)
to trade so my parents would be like in (8:32 - 8:37)
charge of the the (8:35 - 8:40)
trades I was a very controlled Pokemon (8:37 - 8:42)
yeah yeah yeah yeah okay the cards the (8:40 - 8:45)

to each other and we said something in (8:55 - 8:58)
one Teddy rexin then you turned it to (8:56 - 8:59)
each other so they repeated back back (8:58 - 9:01)
and forth and slowly devolved into (8:59 - 9:04)
unintelligible speech good times and (9:01 - 9:07)
then there was there was funco land yeah (9:04 - 9:09)
good old Funko (9:07 - 9:11)

morning it shuts off it says that was (10:06 - 10:11)
only three hours no it wasn't I went to (10:08 - 10:14)

at 8 you need a camera in your bedroom (10:14 - 10:20)
to see what your dogs are doing around (10:17 - 10:24)
your head ATM No No cameras no TVs in (10:20 - 10:27)
the bedroom how clearly it's a dog issue (10:24 - 10:30)
then if it's not a you issue (10:27 - 10:34)
are youing my wonderful dogs I did have (10:30 - 10:36)
Archer turn mine off once in like the (10:34 - 10:39)
last two weeks he just plopped right on (10:36 - 10:42)
top of it and pounded off my Trillium (10:39 - 10:45)
likes playing with the wrist strap on it (10:42 - 10:47)
so at this point I just I have a (10:45 - 10:49)
pillowcase with a zipper I just put it (10:47 - 10:52)
inside the pillowcase when I'm (10:49 - 10:52)
asleep uh being on taupe Island taupe (10:53 - 11:00)
Hollow I it's the worst experience (10:57 - 11:03)
ever R I got a sheet what are you (11:00 - 11:05)
talking about I got a she I would love (11:03 - 11:09)
to have gotten a sheet I I'm in Gulpin (11:05 - 11:12)
and Crow gunville and none neither are (11:09 - 11:16)
good I don't want I had a cute Hound (11:12 - 11:20)
hour lying on it back showing its belly (11:16 - 11:22)
to me this morning and I'm like what a (11:20 - 11:25)
good puppy I got a shiny Jigglypuff I (11:22 - 11:27)
got a whole bunch of geod dudes and (11:25 - 11:31)
larvitars and Rola and I'm happy I like (11:27 - 11:36)
this place I cannot St so many Atkins (11:31 - 11:37)
Atkins is great though I don't think I'm (11:36 - 11:40)
ever going to use it but it sleeps (11:37 - 11:41)
really (11:40 - 11:45)
adorably yeah um so we we didn't get any (11:41 - 11:49)
new news for the eveve event um it is (11:45 - 11:52)
supposed to kick off on Monday the 20th (11:49 - 11:54)
at 4:00 a.m. is are these times right (11:52 - 11:59)
I'm pretty sure that the days reset at 4 (11:54 - 12:01)
but I feel like now the days reset at 3 (11:59 - 12:03)
because of daylight savings (12:01 - 12:06)
time that's very likely yeah so that's (12:03 - 12:08)
why I'm questioning if these times are (12:06 - 12:10)
correct I think the new restart in (12:08 - 12:12)
America is 3:00 a.m. and not 4:00 a.m. (12:10 - 12:16)
anymore which I (12:12 - 12:18)
actually literally and figured Le (12:16 - 12:21)
changed my sleep schedule around sleep (12:18 - 12:24)
cuz I realized 400 a.m. was just bad for (12:21 - 12:26)
sleep cuz that's when the thing reset (12:24 - 12:29)
and I I physically changed my sleep (12:26 - 12:33)
schedule to like 3:15 a.m. so I'd go to (12:29 - 12:35)
bed a little earlier I'd make sure (12:33 - 12:38)
Pokemon sleep is okay Archer is really (12:35 - 12:41)
on board with the new sleep time I was (12:38 - 12:44)
doing it for like a month and now (12:41 - 12:48)
3:15 which is my new bedtime is daylight (12:44 - 12:51)
savings time has ruined me daylight (12:48 - 12:53)
saving time has ruined everything it's (12:51 - 12:55)
bad and it needs to go (12:53 - 12:59)
away that's true they might fix it (12:55 - 13:02)
because I think 4 a.m is intended to be (12:59 - 13:06)
the day the time when the day turns (13:02 - 13:10)
over I think so yes so I hope they would (13:06 - 13:12)
fix it I haven't seen that in their (13:10 - 13:14)
recorded bugs but I also haven't looked (13:12 - 13:16)
at that in a little (13:14 - 13:19)
while they're good at fixing things this (13:16 - 13:21)
is a good team I'll tweet at them be (13:19 - 13:23)
like hey is this (13:21 - 13:26)
intentional it's really messing up (13:23 - 13:29)
my my Riolu finding (13:26 - 13:31)
all right the EV event is uh starts at (13:29 - 13:34)
Monday at 4:00 a.m. it goes (13:31 - 13:38)
until um well the first part goes until (13:34 - 13:42)
Tuesday until 4:00 a.m. and then Eevee (13:38 - 13:45)
day will be Tuesday November 21st to the (13:42 - 13:48)
22nd and then we'll go back to normal EV (13:45 - 13:51)
stuff um so it's supposed to be a 7-Day (13:48 - 13:56)
event uh for the non EV day (13:51 - 13:58)
days uh you will have a greater (13:56 - 14:00)
appearance R for Eevee and its (13:58 - 14:03)
Evolutions during sleep research a few (14:00 - 14:04)
Pokemon of different sleep types will (14:03 - 14:07)
appear regardless of researchers sleep (14:04 - 14:10)
type for the day you may encounter a (14:07 - 14:13)
shiny Eevee main skills for all helper (14:10 - 14:16)
Pokemon are 1.5 times more likely to be (14:13 - 14:20)
triggered and then on Eevee day which is (14:16 - 14:20)
the (14:20 - 14:23)
21st uh greater appearance for Eevee and (14:20 - 14:25)
its Evolutions many Pokémon of different (14:23 - 14:27)
sleep types will appear you may (14:25 - 14:28)
encounter a shiny Eevee you will also (14:27 - 14:29)
get (14:28 - 14:33)
1,121 bonus points and main skills will (14:29 - 14:36)
be 1.5 times more likely to trigger (14:33 - 14:38)
greater appearance of Vaporeon jolon (14:36 - 14:43)
Flareon espon Umbreon Leafeon glacon and (14:38 - 14:43)
sylvon uh it says it the appearance rate (14:43 - 14:50)
of Eevees will apply to all (14:47 - 14:54)
areas um but uh Grass Island will be (14:50 - 14:58)
focused on Jolan Leafeon Sylveon Sion (14:54 - 15:00)
Beach will be VAP poron top Hollow will (14:58 - 15:03)
be Flareon Espeon Umbreon and if you've (15:00 - 15:06)
unlocked snow drop Tundra that will be (15:03 - 15:09)
glacon you will only be able to see one (15:06 - 15:12)
sleep style for each Flareon and Leafeon (15:09 - 15:14)
the other sleep Styles will be viewable (15:12 - 15:16)
in a new area that will be added in the (15:14 - 15:18)
future so I guess they're confirming a (15:16 - 15:19)
new (15:18 - 15:23)
area I do think Vaporeon is one of the (15:19 - 15:25)
better I think it's like Vaporeon (15:23 - 15:28)
Sylveon and Umbreon are like the top (15:25 - 15:29)
three (15:28 - 15:33)
Eevees um and Leafeon is like the (15:29 - 15:36)
worst fun fact about it's not like the (15:33 - 15:37)
worst worse (15:36 - 15:42)
but um because Eevee I didn't know this (15:37 - 15:44)
Eevee is the one Pokemon where when you (15:42 - 15:47)
evolve it in Pokemon sleep it's skill (15:44 - 15:51)
changes so Eevee has like ingredient (15:47 - 15:55)
finder and it gets a bunch of milk and I (15:51 - 15:57)
had a really good one but and it was (15:55 - 15:59)
getting all thek it was like it was like (15:57 - 16:01)
a Milkman Eevee it was getting all the (15:59 - 16:03)
milk it had like some gold skills all (16:01 - 16:06)
the milks I loved it I was like oh I (16:03 - 16:08)
have a leaf stone I'll evolve it to (16:06 - 16:11)
Leafeon without knowing that its ability (16:08 - 16:13)
changes and now I have (16:11 - 16:17)
a semi- useless Leafeon and I could have (16:13 - 16:19)
had a really cool I could literally (16:17 - 16:21)
could have waited for anything (16:19 - 16:23)
else this is not happen with other (16:21 - 16:27)
Pokemon it's just Eevee if if your (16:23 - 16:30)
Charmander is a sausage machine when you (16:27 - 16:32)
evolve it it will continue to be a (16:30 - 16:35)
sausage machine heck yeah happy (16:32 - 16:38)
International Men's (16:35 - 16:38)
Day 87% male (16:38 - 16:45)
12.5% (16:42 - 16:45)
female there's an Eevee event in Masters (16:48 - 16:53)
G get get the Eevee kid from Galler for (16:51 - 16:56)
no apparent reason Elaine her name is (16:53 - 16:58)
Elaine hey I was going to ask you quick (16:56 - 17:01)
quiz do you know who the protagonist in (16:58 - 17:05)
let's go Eve's name is it's aane there's (17:01 - 17:07)
two cuz there's a lane who is released (17:05 - 17:09)
and then there's Eevee kid from Galler (17:07 - 17:10)
who is also released who can get for (17:09 - 17:12)
free yeah the person who's just dressed (17:10 - 17:16)
up in the Eevee ones the E kid Co is (17:12 - 17:17)
that like a is that's not like a five (17:16 - 17:19)
star syn pair right no it's the three (17:17 - 17:22)
star kid the kid's three (17:19 - 17:27)
stars uh Elaine and Penny are five star (17:22 - 17:30)
EXs so you can get them up to (17:27 - 17:30)
uh speaking of Eevee there was the Seven (17:31 - 17:37)
Star Eevee and the Eevee mass outbreaks (17:34 - 17:39)
I don't think either of these events are (17:37 - 17:41)
repeating um they only announced one (17:39 - 17:44)
weekend and normally when they announce (17:41 - 17:47)
the stuff they announced too uh but (17:44 - 17:50)
that's not the case but maybe it's going (17:47 - 17:54)
to repeat and they just haven't said (17:50 - 17:54)
that unless you know it is it is Sunday (17:55 - 17:59)
so maybe at 6 p.m. on Sunday they (17:58 - 18:03)
announc another event but (17:59 - 18:06)
um I don't know why they wouldn't want (18:03 - 18:09)
to repeat it over the (18:06 - 18:09)
holiday but fa point I mean this is the (18:10 - 18:16)
one weekend closest to EV day itself but (18:13 - 18:19)
yeah holiday would be a helpful time to (18:16 - 18:21)
have it (18:19 - 18:23)
going (18:21 - 18:26)
um like this is this I guess this is (18:23 - 18:29)
like the technical aspect of s stars (18:26 - 18:31)
because I or yeah Seven Stars cuz I I (18:29 - 18:32)
don't know if people pay that much (18:31 - 18:35)
attention I also feel like the average (18:32 - 18:36)
Pokemon person does this once and then (18:35 - 18:38)
never does it (18:36 - 18:40)
again which is like fine like like (18:38 - 18:42)
that's not me like criticizing it's (18:40 - 18:45)
totally understandable right um somebody (18:42 - 18:48)
who does it you know 50 60 70 times to (18:45 - 18:51)
try to max out shards or I think it was (18:48 - 18:54)
giving HP up um you know stuff that I (18:51 - 18:57)
find useful because I play the game a (18:54 - 19:00)
lot this is the second time the first (18:57 - 19:03)
time being was tyan where the boss only (19:00 - 19:06)
picks one Pokemon to (19:03 - 19:07)
Target and (19:06 - 19:09)
it's (19:07 - 19:15)
weird I I I I don't know like what (19:09 - 19:15)
the the reasoning for that is so let me (19:16 - 19:22)
explain so when you when you (19:18 - 19:25)
um when you fought uh cinderace (19:22 - 19:28)
cinderace would always bulk up on turn (19:25 - 19:29)
zero (19:28 - 19:32)
and then it would pyro ball everyone um (19:29 - 19:34)
on turn zero so you had to survive like (19:32 - 19:36)
a plus one pyro ball that was its first (19:34 - 19:38)
turn and then Greninja you know (19:36 - 19:39)
something a little different Greninja (19:38 - 19:41)
would open up with toxic spikes (19:39 - 19:42)
obviously that would apply to everyone (19:41 - 19:47)
and then it would double team um and I (19:42 - 19:48)
could go on for each one like Pikachu (19:47 - 19:50)
would open up with rain dance and then (19:48 - 19:51)
it would use surf surf would hit (19:50 - 19:54)
everyone in the tyion it was the first (19:51 - 19:56)
raid where it opened up and it used to (19:54 - 19:58)
move it used willowisp and it only (19:56 - 19:59)
willowisp (19:58 - 20:02)
one Pokemon and depending on what it did (19:59 - 20:05)
if willowwisp hit it would use sunny day (20:02 - 20:06)
if Willow whisp didn't hit it would wait (20:05 - 20:09)
till turn two to sunny day and I just (20:06 - 20:11)
don't (20:09 - 20:13)
like I don't know why it just wouldn't (20:11 - 20:17)
willowwisp everyone like it was weird (20:13 - 20:18)
that it would just like I'm going to one (20:17 - 20:20)
in four chance of if you're going to get (20:18 - 20:22)
willowisp and Eevee did the same thing (20:20 - 20:24)
with the the tyion where it opens with (20:22 - 20:27)
baby doll eyes but it only picks one (20:24 - 20:30)
Pokemon to do that too and we talked (20:27 - 20:31)
about how like last (20:30 - 20:34)
week or not last week well last (20:31 - 20:35)
sevenstar raid the raid boss would kind (20:34 - 20:39)
of be like the tyion was a little dumb (20:35 - 20:42)
in like trying to yeah yeah use like (20:39 - 20:45)
fire type moves on a like well- baked (20:42 - 20:49)
body or Flame or um Flashfire (20:45 - 20:52)
Pokemon and you would think that the CPU (20:49 - 20:54)
would go oh this didn't work the first (20:52 - 20:56)
time I'm going to change and not use (20:54 - 20:59)
this again um (20:56 - 21:01)
um (20:59 - 21:05)
and may maybe the EV like they're (21:01 - 21:07)
programmed in a way that I can't (21:05 - 21:10)
necessarily pinpoint because I (21:07 - 21:14)
brought gallerian Zapdos from and which (21:10 - 21:16)
has defiant and it's like okay one in (21:14 - 21:18)
four chance of baby do eyes didn't baby (21:16 - 21:21)
do eyes me so I don't get the defiant (21:18 - 21:24)
boost which is fine because it resets it (21:21 - 21:25)
pretty quickly (21:24 - 21:27)
anyways but then it it it didn't it (21:25 - 21:31)
didn't charm me at all um and it didn't (21:27 - 21:34)
baby doll eyes me again so I was like oh (21:31 - 21:36)
well you know the defiant thing not that (21:34 - 21:38)
big of a deal but then I heard like (21:36 - 21:39)
annihilate players being like Oh yeah it (21:38 - 21:42)
Charmed me Non-Stop and that's great (21:39 - 21:45)
which it's not because if you get (21:42 - 21:47)
Charmed that's Nega -2 and your defiant (21:45 - 21:49)
just puts you back at plus two so you're (21:47 - 21:50)
actually not going anywhere so it (21:49 - 21:53)
Charming you doesn't actually matter but (21:50 - 21:54)
like how is it (21:53 - 21:57)
determining whether to charm or not to (21:54 - 22:03)
charm slash baby doll eyes it's it's (21:57 - 22:05)
just there is some intelligence (22:03 - 22:07)
programmed in these bosses but at the (22:05 - 22:09)
same (22:07 - 22:11)
time when when people ask for Pokemon (22:09 - 22:16)
games to be like harder or more (22:11 - 22:19)
challenging it's really hard for that to (22:16 - 22:21)
H like you have so much choice in what (22:19 - 22:24)
you're bringing right like uh you know (22:21 - 22:26)
if you're going against brassus and (22:24 - 22:28)
you're bringing you know a fire typee (22:26 - 22:31)
Pokemon you clearly have the advantage (22:28 - 22:34)
right if you want that to be harder you (22:31 - 22:37)
can go against eono with like water (22:34 - 22:38)
Pokemon right that's going to be a (22:37 - 22:39)
little bit more challenging since you (22:38 - 22:41)
have the disadvantage but at the same (22:39 - 22:43)
time when the computer (22:41 - 22:46)
makes really I I think that's what takes (22:43 - 22:49)
people away is like oh I'm Willow wisped (22:46 - 22:52)
and the move you decided to use is (22:49 - 22:54)
Willow you just you just burned me will (22:52 - 22:55)
willowwisp why are you pressing (22:54 - 22:58)
willowwisp again I think like I'm I I (22:55 - 23:01)
don't mind if it's okay this is a little (22:58 - 23:02)
bit harder or this is a little bit (23:01 - 23:04)
easier I think for me what takes me out (23:02 - 23:06)
of it is when the computer makes the (23:04 - 23:11)
most obviously wrong (23:06 - 23:15)
play if that makes sense yeah I mean I I (23:11 - 23:17)
get what you're saying like there's (23:15 - 23:18)
times there are definitely times when (23:17 - 23:20)
the (23:18 - 23:23)
AI shows that it is AI and it wasn't (23:20 - 23:26)
made particularly well and those are (23:23 - 23:29)
very offputting (23:26 - 23:31)
um when you're just (23:29 - 23:34)
like okay like I know this is I know (23:31 - 23:37)
this is computerized and I know all (23:34 - 23:42)
right fine I get it like the problem is (23:37 - 23:46)
I think compounded in this generation (23:42 - 23:48)
when they have really well-designed (23:46 - 23:51)
encounters and really well-designed (23:48 - 23:54)
raids it makes the ones that do that (23:51 - 23:57)
feel like they just sort of phoned it in (23:54 - 24:01)
a little bit like before when everybody (23:57 - 24:03)
was bad and you're just like that's just (24:01 - 24:04)
how the computer is and they've never (24:03 - 24:06)
really cared about programming (24:04 - 24:09)
intelligent trainers because you know (24:06 - 24:10)
they don't want you to get stuck on (24:09 - 24:11)
something that you can never get past (24:10 - 24:14)
frustration blah blah blah blah blah I (24:11 - 24:16)
think it's harder to swallow that now (24:14 - 24:18)
when you are supposed to be (24:16 - 24:21)
doing harder content that is that you (24:18 - 24:25)
are deliberately designing to be more (24:21 - 24:28)
difficult and they make choices that (24:25 - 24:32)
remind you of the old way where they (24:28 - 24:34)
didn't really care much or it was just (24:32 - 24:35)
like the computer wasn't programmed very (24:34 - 24:39)
well I think that just reads poorly at (24:35 - 24:42)
that level it was you know it's (24:39 - 24:43)
sometimes it is randomized like they (24:42 - 24:45)
have some randomizations in there (24:43 - 24:46)
because there's a few times when I've (24:45 - 24:48)
been raiding where I'm like why would (24:46 - 24:52)
the boss do that again right now but (24:48 - 24:55)
generally in raids those are much more (24:52 - 24:57)
party-wide affecting it's like well I (24:55 - 24:58)
just did this so I can do it again but (24:57 - 25:01)
it's still a challenge when it does but (24:58 - 25:03)
Pokemon does that weird thing where when (25:01 - 25:06)
it does something again often it's not a (25:03 - 25:10)
challenge and that just feels (25:06 - 25:10)
bad yeah I I would also (25:11 - 25:17)
assume that when they're they're because (25:15 - 25:19)
I I I I (25:17 - 25:23)
do enjoy what the Seven Star Puzzle is (25:19 - 25:24)
because at the end of the day it's just (25:23 - 25:27)
like what what is what is the puzzle you (25:24 - 25:29)
know and we went for from (25:27 - 25:33)
like you know I I I think back to Mewtwo (25:29 - 25:37)
where you know I streamed Mewtwo and I (25:33 - 25:39)
was I was in a hotel and I I I hit going (25:37 - 25:42)
live and within seconds I had a thousand (25:39 - 25:46)
people watching right because Mewtwo was (25:42 - 25:51)
so people like Mewtwo a lot right and so (25:46 - 25:53)
it was stressful for me not because a (25:51 - 25:55)
thousand people were there but because I (25:53 - 26:00)
was in a hotel room on a 15inch MacBook (25:55 - 26:03)
and having like a twitch chat on my iPad (26:00 - 26:04)
like I'm not in front of this huge like (26:03 - 26:07)
36 inch display with my normal setup (26:04 - 26:11)
right so I'm stressed because I I'm on (26:07 - 26:13)
this very small computer in a hotel room (26:11 - 26:16)
with now a thousand people asking how we (26:13 - 26:18)
do how are we going to do Mewtwo and the (26:16 - 26:20)
amount of people that were like this is (26:18 - 26:24)
too hard and me thinking well it's only (26:20 - 26:26)
been out for 15 minutes there's no way (26:24 - 26:28)
you've done it twice because it's a (26:26 - 26:31)
10-minute raid so you've failed it once (26:28 - 26:34)
and then admitted that it's too hard (26:31 - 26:36)
when it's like it's you know at a (26:34 - 26:38)
certain point like I got Mewtwo down to (26:36 - 26:40)
be beating able being able to beat it in (26:38 - 26:42)
like four minutes right you know we had (26:40 - 26:44)
60% of the timer left it's 10-minute (26:42 - 26:46)
raid um because we figured out the (26:44 - 26:48)
puzzle and then we optimized the puzzle (26:46 - 26:51)
how can we solve the puzzle even faster (26:48 - 26:58)
um and so the the the problem the the (26:51 - 27:00)
scenario with Mewtwo was the puzzle (26:58 - 27:02)
wasn't obvious right away with something (27:00 - 27:05)
like Eevee you would think that game (27:02 - 27:08)
freak is like okay this is a normal type (27:05 - 27:11)
Pokemon with a normal terot type the two (27:08 - 27:12)
Pokemon that are probably being brought (27:11 - 27:16)
the most would be Iron hands and (27:12 - 27:18)
annihilate like they must know which (27:16 - 27:21)
Pokemon are coming but they didn't have (27:18 - 27:23)
like any solutions for those Pokemon and (27:21 - 27:28)
maybe you know they don't care but I I (27:23 - 27:31)
think that's like you look at all of E's (27:28 - 27:33)
moves and you're like oh it gets yawn (27:31 - 27:35)
you know if it does put you to sleep (27:33 - 27:37)
that would slow you down and obviously (27:35 - 27:39)
if you're racing against the timer that (27:37 - 27:41)
would be the one advantage Eevee would (27:39 - 27:43)
have and they don't even give it yawn (27:41 - 27:45)
and it's like okay the defiant thing (27:43 - 27:46)
with a nype is not like that big of a (27:45 - 27:48)
deal because it just cancels each other (27:46 - 27:51)
out and then you think of iron hands and (27:48 - 27:53)
that's why I was like oh critical hit (27:51 - 27:54)
iron hands would be really good because (27:53 - 27:57)
if your ne6 attack doesn't matter your (27:54 - 27:59)
critical hit and so like my take away (27:57 - 28:01)
from that of like teaching people is (27:59 - 28:04)
like hey did you know because maybe some (28:01 - 28:05)
people don't there's lots of people that (28:04 - 28:06)
don't right there are still people that (28:05 - 28:08)
I have to explain what stab is like what (28:06 - 28:10)
is same type ATT Tech bonus like that's (28:08 - 28:11)
fine like people are always learning (28:10 - 28:12)
this might be their first Pokemon game (28:11 - 28:13)
this might be their first game where (28:12 - 28:15)
they're actually building a Pokemon for (28:13 - 28:17)
a raid so I do think at the end of the (28:15 - 28:19)
day seven star raids are great because (28:17 - 28:21)
they are may they are teaching you (28:19 - 28:24)
things that like from point A to point B (28:21 - 28:29)
to credits don't teach you right (28:24 - 28:31)
yeah they don't do a very good job at (28:29 - 28:34)
teaching you in game though like they oh (28:31 - 28:36)
sure sure they aren't (28:34 - 28:39)
particularly open I mean we still can't (28:36 - 28:41)
sort of see the (28:39 - 28:45)
whole who's bringing levels like they (28:41 - 28:47)
they teach you in the fact that you have (28:45 - 28:49)
to go elsewhere to figure out how to do (28:47 - 28:51)
it right and I don't necessarily think (28:49 - 28:54)
that's teaching I think that (28:51 - 28:59)
is uh they just make a thing and and (28:54 - 29:01)
rely on their fans and Community to do (28:59 - 29:03)
work for free for people to be able to (29:01 - 29:05)
play their content which I don't think (29:03 - 29:09)
is a particularly great business (29:05 - 29:11)
model it's great for Content creators (29:09 - 29:14)
though there is that I am a little bit (29:11 - 29:16)
curious whether (29:14 - 29:19)
the this whole situation where the eeve (29:16 - 29:20)
is only targeting one person at first (29:19 - 29:22)
and the Ty loan is are only targeting (29:20 - 29:24)
one person at first I'm very curious (29:22 - 29:26)
whether they have intentionally made (29:24 - 29:28)
things a little bit (29:26 - 29:30)
easier in that way (29:28 - 29:33)
Mewtwo uh maybe because of Mewtwo maybe (29:30 - 29:34)
because of whatever other stats they (29:33 - 29:36)
were seeing with how many people were (29:34 - 29:38)
doing the raids over time I'm just (29:36 - 29:40)
curious if the raids are going to (29:38 - 29:43)
continue to be easier than they were say (29:40 - 29:46)
before tyion oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I I (29:43 - 29:49)
mean they have to know how many people (29:46 - 29:50)
are doing it how many people are (29:49 - 29:53)
completing it what is the most popular (29:50 - 29:55)
Pokemon people are bringing like they (29:53 - 29:59)
have to know all that stuff um oh yeah (29:55 - 30:02)
and now that Eevee has so so e the the (29:59 - 30:04)
interesting thing about E2 is it's the (30:02 - 30:07)
first seven star that has repeated its (30:04 - 30:10)
Terra a terot type already used so um (30:07 - 30:13)
reloom had the normal terot type and so (30:10 - 30:16)
Eevee having normal is the is a repeat (30:13 - 30:19)
so I think the ones the the pypes that (30:16 - 30:21)
have not been used (30:19 - 30:25)
are steel dark (30:21 - 30:28)
electric and I think ground I think (30:25 - 30:29)
those are the last four that have not (30:28 - 30:32)
been used uh obviously we got (30:29 - 30:35)
huan tyion and we got (30:32 - 30:40)
huan deui and we're waiting on huian (30:35 - 30:43)
samarat so it's it's it's very likely I (30:40 - 30:45)
mean like if I if I was to put you know (30:43 - 30:48)
a a a if I was to put something on red (30:45 - 30:50)
or black it's I'm I'm I'm pretty much (30:48 - 30:53)
going like Hui and samro has to be water (30:50 - 30:55)
even though that's repeating because (30:53 - 30:58)
that would match the theme that they did (30:55 - 31:01)
with tyion and and deui which tyion was (30:58 - 31:05)
fire and deui was grass um but before (31:01 - 31:06)
this Eevee would have came out you would (31:05 - 31:08)
have thought like oh it's maybe it's (31:06 - 31:09)
going to be dark because they they (31:08 - 31:11)
already did water and they haven't they (31:09 - 31:13)
haven't done dark yet (31:11 - 31:15)
but um the water was a little bit (31:13 - 31:17)
different because that was the Pikachu (31:15 - 31:20)
one yeah and it was it was I it was a (31:17 - 31:23)
fun one for Pikachu so and this Eevee (31:20 - 31:24)
one's a little bit different so the (31:23 - 31:26)
repeat there kind of makes sense yeah (31:24 - 31:29)
yeah so I I I would assume we have what (31:26 - 31:32)
we have DLC in less than a month uh we (31:29 - 31:34)
still have a couple weekends left uh I (31:32 - 31:36)
would assume that tyion would Pro or (31:34 - 31:38)
sorry samuro would probably come before (31:36 - 31:40)
that we still don't have (31:38 - 31:41)
[Music] (31:40 - 31:44)
roaring oh gosh what are they called uh (31:41 - 31:47)
the the the raicho with the neck and (31:44 - 31:51)
the iron crown (31:47 - 31:53)
and ah what is it called I don't (31:51 - 31:54)
remember what they're called the tip of (31:53 - 31:56)
my tongue the fact that I remembered the (31:54 - 31:59)
Cobalion over the Reich well they all (31:56 - 32:01)
start with (31:59 - 32:05)
iron is it so I I wonder I don't think I (32:01 - 32:06)
don't think we're going to get those (32:05 - 32:10)
before the DLC at this point no I think (32:06 - 32:14)
that is like DLC is out these Pokemon (32:10 - 32:16)
come out because that that is going to (32:14 - 32:19)
get people to come back and then well (32:16 - 32:22)
they still have the last set of two that (32:19 - 32:24)
is undoubtedly going to be announced and (32:22 - 32:26)
come out I really thought that this set (32:24 - 32:29)
of the raicho and the cabalian uh (32:26 - 32:31)
paradoxes was going to go with the first (32:29 - 32:36)
DLC yeah yeah yeah I and raging bolt (32:31 - 32:41)
raage raging bolt that's um and uh are (32:36 - 32:44)
they going to do walking wake (32:41 - 32:47)
and iron leaves again are we going to be (32:44 - 32:49)
able to catch more than one there are (32:47 - 32:52)
still like there are still people out (32:49 - 32:53)
there that don't have walking wake like (32:52 - 32:56)
if you look at the Pokémon home GTS like (32:53 - 32:58)
walking wake is like one of the most (32:56 - 33:01)
requested Pokemon because it came once (32:58 - 33:03)
and people struggled with that I mean (33:01 - 33:05)
again probably people listening to the (33:03 - 33:06)
show they're like oh I I did all the (33:05 - 33:08)
Seven Stars they've all been easy I did (33:06 - 33:10)
my walking Wick I did but there you know (33:08 - 33:12)
there are people who don't have YouTube (33:10 - 33:14)
resources or twitch resources or Discord (33:12 - 33:17)
servers or friends (33:14 - 33:20)
that they don't or or or just a news (33:17 - 33:22)
Outlet to be like hey you have a very (33:20 - 33:24)
limited time to get walk no one cares (33:22 - 33:25)
about iron leaves hey you got a very (33:24 - 33:29)
limited time to get walking way (33:25 - 33:32)
rude rude so like if they bring walking (33:29 - 33:34)
wake back does everyone does everyone (33:32 - 33:35)
get a chance is it only people that (33:34 - 33:39)
didn't get it it's it's like I I regret (33:35 - 33:41)
as a player who bought both scarlet and (33:39 - 33:43)
violet to I I regret not doing it twice (33:41 - 33:45)
I should have went to my other game and (33:43 - 33:48)
and did it and I I didn't do that so (33:45 - 33:50)
like I (33:48 - 33:53)
didn't maybe maybe in the DLC you can (33:50 - 33:55)
just get as many walking bakes as you (33:53 - 33:56)
want maybe there's some underground (33:55 - 33:58)
Paradox area where they're walking (33:56 - 34:00)
around with like roaring moon or (33:58 - 34:03)
something I don't know but like (34:00 - 34:05)
eventually they'll come out in Pokemon (34:03 - 34:08)
go yeah oh yeah AB 10 years down the (34:05 - 34:11)
road 10 years down the line they'll uh (34:08 - 34:14)
then you could spend $1 per walking wake (34:11 - 34:16)
although Pokemon go does have more Pala (34:14 - 34:19)
Pokemon than it has gallerian Pokemon at (34:16 - 34:24)
this point so yeah um okay uh let's take (34:19 - 34:29)
a quick break we'll be right right (34:24 - 34:33)
back and we are back from our break uh (34:29 - 34:37)
they announced palan Fates this is some (34:33 - 34:41)
TCG news uh which is (34:37 - 34:45)
the I know not not a not a DLC not the (34:41 - 34:46)
DLC you were (34:45 - 34:51)
expecting um so they do this where they (34:46 - 34:54)
release these special sets um palan (34:51 - 34:57)
Fates is supposed to come out in January (34:54 - 35:01)

Shiny Pokemon including Shiny Pikachu (35:01 - 35:07)

supporters six hyper rare cards of (35:35 - 35:41)
Select Pokemon EX featuring a you new (35:38 - 35:44)
and unique raised foil which is kind of (35:41 - 35:47)
cool and then a handful of Full Art (35:44 - 35:48)
supporter (35:47 - 35:50)
cards uh this is based off Japan's a (35:48 - 35:53)
version of shiny treasure ex which comes (35:50 - 35:56)
out on December (35:53 - 35:58)
1st uh um this is the third this is off (35:56 - 36:00)
Pokey Beach if I didn't say that this is (35:58 - 36:02)
the third English set to feature Fates (36:00 - 36:06)
in its name 2019 was hidden Fates 2021 (36:02 - 36:09)
was shining Fates and then this is palan (36:06 - 36:12)
Fates so I don't say they it's not like (36:09 - 36:14)
they do this often it seems like they do (36:12 - 36:16)
this about every two years even though (36:14 - 36:17)
it does feel like often just because (36:16 - 36:19)
they come out with a lot of (36:17 - 36:21)
cards uh let's talk about the elephant (36:19 - 36:23)
in the room which is the four Pokémon (36:21 - 36:25)
they decided to feature on the cover of (36:23 - 36:27)
these which is Pikachu obviously we all (36:25 - 36:29)
love shiny Pikachu not you know subtle (36:27 - 36:34)
shiny but you know but a very common (36:29 - 36:36)
Pokemon Dondo which turns from its Blue (36:34 - 36:40)
to White you know very obvious hard to (36:36 - 36:44)
miss uh tinon which the shiny is It's (36:40 - 36:48)
Hammer yeah turn from a silver to a (36:44 - 36:52)
copper which is cool uh clever and then (36:48 - 36:56)
they decided to put suru Edge yeah on (36:52 - 36:58)
the cover (36:56 - 37:02)
which if you don't know it's shiny as (36:58 - 37:07)
its eye yeah I have one and every time (37:02 - 37:08)
I'm like what is different about all (37:07 - 37:13)
right the eyeball I only see its back (37:08 - 37:14)
so (37:13 - 37:18)
um that was a choice oh yeah that that (37:14 - 37:21)
was definitely a choice there there's a (37:18 - 37:24)
lot of Pokemon iconic Pokemon that they (37:21 - 37:26)
could have like cloth and I don't think (37:24 - 37:29)
cloth is is Iconic but I would say that (37:26 - 37:31)
in the marketing aspect a lot of people (37:29 - 37:35)
know who Koff is if if you're a person (37:31 - 37:37)
who has only played the first part of (37:35 - 37:39)
the game which is a lot of people a lot (37:37 - 37:41)
of people buy a game and only get like (37:39 - 37:43)
literally 10% and they drop off you (37:41 - 37:45)
probably saw cloth at least that's the (37:43 - 37:48)
first thing you like fight the very (37:45 - 37:50)
depend on which direction you go in you (37:48 - 37:52)
can go in the whole other direction true (37:50 - 37:59)
true but uh a very good shiny um but (37:52 - 38:03)
they they decided to put suu Edge on the (37:59 - 38:07)
cover uh and (38:03 - 38:09)
Charizard not on the same cover but they (38:07 - 38:11)
do feature Charizard they do feature a (38:09 - 38:14)
shiny charizard when that that was the (38:11 - 38:17)
hidden Fates one those are the older (38:14 - 38:21)
packs yeah my bad um uh and then they (38:17 - 38:25)
they they're they're releasing uh tins (38:21 - 38:26)
and I just want to point out the Pokemon (38:25 - 38:27)
the tins (38:26 - 38:29)
uh so one is (38:27 - 38:33)
flamigo uh which it's a lighter pink You (38:29 - 38:36)
Know M very I think obvious uh Palin (38:33 - 38:40)
which is a darker blue you know good uh (38:36 - 38:44)
Tink gets more representation uh was (38:40 - 38:46)
what this one called Tinka (38:44 - 38:50)
tot what's the little one called tin (38:46 - 38:53)
tin I don't think it's that but I'm very (38:50 - 38:56)
into (38:53 - 38:59)
that (38:56 - 38:59)
I don't think I don't think it's tin a (38:59 - 39:04)
dink it's not but it should (39:01 - 39:08)
be it's Tinka Tink that was close Tinka (39:04 - 39:14)
Tink Tinka Tink Tinka tff tin ton got it (39:08 - 39:17)
take a tot I feel like tot makes sense (39:14 - 39:20)
he's a little yeah I (39:17 - 39:20)
mean uh and then and then we we have (39:21 - 39:27)
smiv uh which has the black olive on the (39:24 - 39:32)
top of its thing very obvious and then (39:27 - 39:36)
they decided to put Mouse hold which (39:32 - 39:39)
again arguably if we're if we're (39:36 - 39:43)
thinking what 90 some Pokemon in Pala (39:39 - 39:45)
who who have the worst (39:43 - 39:48)
shinies the top three are probably suru (39:45 - 39:50)
Edge (39:48 - 39:52)
mousehold and somebody else I can't (39:50 - 39:55)
think of right now but (39:52 - 39:58)
like aror rou is isn't great either (39:55 - 40:00)
right yeah yeah yeah (39:58 - 40:05)
yeah here's the thing mousehold SM of (40:00 - 40:09)
and Tinka Tink all seem very angry at at (40:05 - 40:12)
their shiny counterpart they do not seem (40:09 - 40:15)
happy that these shinies exist because (40:12 - 40:18)
they do all seem to be yelling at them (40:15 - 40:21)
for unknown (40:18 - 40:21)
reasons yeah I had thought that that was (40:21 - 40:24)
going to be all the tins but it's not (40:23 - 40:26)
all the tins it's just those three it's (40:24 - 40:28)
just those three Palin's like cool (40:26 - 40:30)
different color (40:28 - 40:33)
great flamigo is just happy to be here (40:30 - 40:35)
happy to be (40:33 - 40:37)
included yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no (40:35 - 40:40)
it's just they're justan sa Titan has a (40:37 - 40:43)
good shiny cloth has a good shiny asra (40:40 - 40:47)
has a good shiny gevard has a good (40:43 - 40:51)
shiny and they were like (40:47 - 40:55)
sured Mouse hold it it like like I don't (40:51 - 40:58)
think there's an over sight there I (40:55 - 41:01)
think it's just let's put the bad (40:58 - 41:04)
shinies on the thing because we know (41:01 - 41:05)
that people will talk we're doing it (41:04 - 41:08)
right now we fell for their (41:05 - 41:12)
trap lechon has a good shiny they it's (41:08 - 41:14)
not like they were like oh boy which (41:12 - 41:17)
ones do we (41:14 - 41:17)
do uh you know the choices were (41:21 - 41:28)
made (41:25 - 41:28)
were uh but yeah you know another set (41:30 - 41:35)
another Charizard they (41:32 - 41:38)
they you know people would be like why (41:35 - 41:41)
but you know the answer to that question (41:38 - 41:43)
we all know the answer to that (41:41 - 41:47)
question like they're they're a (41:43 - 41:51)
company and Charizard is going to sell (41:47 - 41:53)
more booster (41:51 - 41:57)
packs than giraff Rick I'm sorry giraff (41:53 - 42:00)
rig lovers your boy just not selling (41:57 - 42:03)
packs like Charizard is it's just why (42:00 - 42:07)
why would you not keep relying on your (42:03 - 42:10)
heavy hitter look if if you like finon (42:07 - 42:13)
that's great that's fine start buying (42:10 - 42:15)
all the phon merch anytime they put out (42:13 - 42:18)
a plush buy it all until do you think I (42:15 - 42:21)
do every day of my life I'm my Fon (42:18 - 42:24)
collection is enormous and it's not (42:21 - 42:26)
moving the needle you should be (42:24 - 42:28)
recording in your finon dedicated room I (42:26 - 42:29)
know you have (42:28 - 42:33)
Greg it's true 400 counting finon (42:29 - 42:35)
sitting cuties in that (42:33 - 42:40)
room I'm lousy with sitting cuties (42:35 - 42:40)
ainon uh yeah this this seems exciting I (42:41 - 42:48)
always like these uh shiny boxes or (42:44 - 42:51)
whatever uh they they are a nice thing (42:48 - 42:53)
where you know if you're not super into (42:51 - 42:54)
the (42:53 - 42:57)
TCG it's still fun to B pick up a couple (42:54 - 42:59)
packs and have a pretty decent time is (42:57 - 43:03)
240 cards a lot it feels like a lot it (42:59 - 43:06)
yeah it is because it say more than 240 (43:03 - 43:08)
cards which is probably like (43:06 - 43:10)
243 no it it's probably like actually (43:08 - 43:13)
260 because they don't count any secret (43:10 - 43:14)
oh right right right right right yeah (43:13 - 43:18)
any any secret rares are not technically (43:14 - 43:21)
counted (43:18 - 43:24)
um shiny treasure the JP the Japanese (43:21 - 43:29)
set had 190 so this is 50 more cards but (43:24 - 43:30)
it's (43:29 - 43:33)
because we're we we still have to play (43:30 - 43:36)
catchup with Japan when it comes to that (43:33 - 43:38)
kind of stuff (43:36 - 43:42)
so um Pokemon cards an expensive (43:38 - 43:45)
hobby hence when I know very little (43:42 - 43:47)
about (43:45 - 43:47)
it it is (43:48 - 43:54)
uh if the T the takeaway here is still (43:51 - 43:57)
they they featured Pokemon that have (43:54 - 43:59)
very terrible shinies in that was (43:57 - 44:00)
definitely (43:59 - 44:04)
intentional the art also keeps getting (44:00 - 44:06)
better yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (44:04 - 44:08)
yeah I I really can't say anything bad (44:06 - 44:10)
about the TCG in this in this state the (44:08 - 44:12)
art looks (44:10 - 44:16)
good the the sets coming out are great (44:12 - 44:18)
the only I guess the only bad thing is (44:16 - 44:19)
it costs money but hey that's everything (44:18 - 44:22)
in the world so (44:19 - 44:25)
yep uh you know speaking of things that (44:22 - 44:29)
I could say bad things about Pokemon go (44:25 - 44:32)
uh they're updating part no this is this (44:29 - 44:34)

announced it they're not updating their (46:15 - 46:20)
news blog as much as they used to (46:17 - 46:23)
they're putting way I would say too many (46:20 - 46:24)
things on social media especially on a (46:23 - 46:27)
social media platform that increasingly (46:24 - 46:28)
fewer people are (46:27 - 46:32)
using um well according to Sports (46:28 - 46:35)
Illustrated yeah Sports Illustrated with (46:32 - 46:37)
the the top link here geez yeah (46:35 - 46:41)
according to Sports (46:37 - 46:41)
Illustrated I believe the route update (46:44 - 46:50)
rolls out the same time yeah it doesn't (46:46 - 46:53)
sense but it would I'm fully expecting (46:50 - 46:56)
it to break something oh hardcore (46:53 - 46:59)
oh sure yeah yeah yeah this is these are (46:56 - 47:00)
two (46:59 - 47:04)
different new features neither of which (47:00 - 47:05)
have been (47:04 - 47:07)
completely uh bug proof all of which (47:05 - 47:09)
have been pretty bug (47:07 - 47:13)
infested and I can't imagine them going (47:09 - 47:14)
together and not breaking something I (47:13 - 47:18)
would say if you have saved teams if you (47:14 - 47:21)
have saved tags maybe take screenshots (47:18 - 47:23)
of everything just in case because we've (47:21 - 47:27)
already seen Party play mess with (47:23 - 47:31)
that but oh according to leak duck it is (47:27 - 47:34)
available now trainers can now follow (47:31 - 47:37)
Roots using Party play uh you may have (47:34 - 47:38)

couple days (47:38 - 47:43)
ago nice I know that some people had (47:40 - 47:47)

thing I'm surprised I didn't hear about (47:47 - 47:51)
it breaking (47:49 - 47:54)
anything kind of disappointed (47:51 - 47:58)

summer yeah when they had uh uh Umbreon (49:35 - 49:42)

um and we are just waiting on (49:48 - 49:52)

for what's like they have to be working (49:52 - 49:56)

tell (49:59 - 50:05)
us what um blazing gets a new outfit uh (50:00 - 50:07)
which is causing a stir across the (50:05 - 50:09)
internet because most people didn't (50:07 - 50:11)
realize that Blazin had a (50:09 - 50:14)
[Laughter] (50:11 - 50:17)
tail it's such a good outfit though if I (50:14 - 50:19)
could I would I would go back to unite (50:17 - 50:20)
and get that plays again with that (50:19 - 50:23)
outfit I mean you can you can give it (50:20 - 50:26)
money and not play I I don't have the (50:23 - 50:29)
money I can't give it (50:26 - 50:29)
money um yeah we are waiting on mowar we (50:30 - 50:36)
are waiting on official Ann announcement (50:34 - 50:39)
of what what ones are coming next there (50:36 - 50:42)
are leaks uh if you really want to go (50:39 - 50:47)
see them uh if you trust in that but (50:42 - 50:49)
there's a lot of there's a lot of leaks (50:47 - 50:51)
out there that (50:49 - 50:53)
are causing a lot of confusion because (50:51 - 50:55)
we just don't really know what's true (50:53 - 50:58)
and what's not not right now (50:55 - 51:02)
um but they've been particularly quiet (50:58 - 51:04)
about a lot of things like it's (51:02 - 51:07)
[Music] (51:04 - 51:07)
been wow probably a couple like the last (51:07 - 51:14)
thing that they really announced was hey (51:11 - 51:16)
comfy gets uh new hollowware that was (51:14 - 51:19)
the seventh and then it's like here we (51:16 - 51:23)
are on the 18th Blazer King gets an (51:19 - 51:26)
outfit but like no announcements of of (51:23 - 51:29)
when moscara or any of the new ones are (51:26 - 51:33)
expected to hit so we don't know like (51:29 - 51:37)
since Halloween they've been really (51:33 - 51:37)
quiet big Christmas event coming I would (51:38 - 51:42)
I we know there's going to be there's (51:41 - 51:43)
going to be some sort of winter holiday (51:42 - 51:46)
event coming up so we know that is and (51:43 - 51:48)
they could be quiet simply (51:46 - 51:50)
because they're planning for that and (51:48 - 51:51)
they want to do a big (51:50 - 51:53)
announcement (51:51 - 51:56)
um so we'll we'll have to see but it's (51:53 - 52:00)
been pre like pretty quiet they've been (51:56 - 52:02)
oh the big (52:00 - 52:04)
change this was the big announcement (52:02 - 52:06)
that that they did do in their most (52:04 - 52:08)
recent patch when they said we don't (52:06 - 52:09)
know (52:08 - 52:11)
why the Kanto (52:09 - 52:14)
starters evolved at a different time (52:11 - 52:16)
than all the other starters in the (52:14 - 52:19)
game so we fixed that so now Blastoise (52:16 - 52:22)
Venusaur and Charizard evolve into their (52:19 - 52:25)
final form at level seven and not level (52:22 - 52:29)
n like they used to so that was a big (52:25 - 52:31)
change that they just put sounds (52:29 - 52:35)
helpful uh don't know why they were ever (52:31 - 52:37)
different but they have since corrected (52:35 - 52:38)
that to be in line with all of the other (52:37 - 52:40)
starters so if you've played those (52:38 - 52:44)
characters uh they are much more (52:40 - 52:46)
playable now with this change because (52:44 - 52:48)
they get their stat boosts to level (52:46 - 52:50)
earlier so that you will not be (52:48 - 52:54)
wondering why you still have a CH you (52:50 - 52:56)
still have (52:54 - 52:58)
why is there an ivy St why are you still (52:56 - 53:00)
war Turtle why are you still Charmeleon (52:58 - 53:03)
for an inappropriate amount of time so (53:00 - 53:05)
now those they fix that so those three (53:03 - 53:07)
will evolve at level seven which is it's (53:05 - 53:09)
a very nice change but it was in patch (53:07 - 53:12)
notes and they did another bunch of re (53:09 - 53:15)
balancing so I think overall the game (53:12 - 53:19)
play is in a good spot um but not much (53:15 - 53:21)
new is happening right now and we are (53:19 - 53:22)
just (53:21 - 53:26)
waiting for announcement dates (53:22 - 53:29)
okay sounds good uh well that'll be our (53:26 - 53:32)
