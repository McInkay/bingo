I (0:00 - 0:03)
[Music] (0:04 - 0:16)
recording what&#39;s up everyone welcome to (0:14 - 0:17)
the (0:16 - 0:20)
647th episode of the Pokemon podcast (0:17 - 0:22)
it&#39;s super effective I&#39;m your host Steve (0:20 - 0:28)
with me is Hannah I am here um I did not (0:22 - 0:29)
play the Pokémon go event yesterday but (0:28 - 0:32)
I at least knew it was going on as (0:29 - 0:35)
opposed to many people who apparently (0:32 - 0:37)
didn&#39;t (0:35 - 0:39)
realize because that&#39;s where we&#39;re at in (0:37 - 0:42)
that game now that was our pregame (0:39 - 0:44)
conversation Bobby also (0:42 - 0:46)
here uh yeah I did do the event (0:44 - 0:49)
yesterday uh it was it was a fine it was (0:46 - 0:51)
a fine event it was it was research it (0:49 - 0:54)
was very easy research tasks that led to (0:51 - 0:57)
encounters with a couple Shiny Pokemon (0:54 - 1:01)
for me so it was fine a (0:57 - 1:04)
review put that on the back of the box (1:01 - 1:07)
Niantic uh we have some news for you we (1:04 - 1:08)
are going to talk about the Pokemon (1:07 - 1:11)
sleep stuff uh we have more Pokemon (1:08 - 1:13)
pocket stuff to talk about and then some (1:11 - 1:17)
smaller things in between so uh I know (1:13 - 1:18)
people are deprived of their Pokemon (1:17 - 1:22)
sleep news so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll start with (1:18 - 1:25)
that (1:22 - 1:25)
um so the thing we mentioned last week (1:26 - 1:31)
was it was it last week or was it the (1:30 - 1:33)
week before I don&#39;t know it&#39;s been a (1:31 - 1:36)
it&#39;s been a blur is that the developers (1:33 - 1:39)
select button are handing over Pokemon (1:36 - 1:41)
sleep to (1:39 - 1:44)
ilka and ilka and the Pokemon company (1:41 - 1:47)
which we talked about like six months (1:44 - 1:51)
ago created a new company called Pokemon (1:47 - 1:56)
Works which I my (1:51 - 1:56)
my I feel like it only exists to get rid (1:58 - 2:05)
of the name ilka that&#39;s what I (2:01 - 2:05)
think you know that&#39;s possible there are (2:06 - 2:13)
probably tax reasons or (2:09 - 2:13)
something so I think my app has updated (2:13 - 2:19)
I don&#39;t know about your guys&#39;s app it (2:17 - 2:21)
says Pokemon works now when (2:19 - 2:24)
you uh open the app on the the splash (2:21 - 2:27)
screen yeah I had noticed that oh yeah (2:24 - 2:28)
there are three it&#39;s like there are (2:27 - 2:31)
three yeah names on there now instead of (2:28 - 2:33)
just the two that there were (2:31 - 2:38)
before so um so there was a there was an (2:33 - 2:41)
interview on (2:38 - 2:44)
fitsu that this was the plan all (2:41 - 2:48)
along and you can go I I&#39;ll link the (2:44 - 2:50)
show notes in the art I&#39;ll link the (2:48 - 2:53)
article in the show notes link the show (2:50 - 2:54)
notes in the article I&#39;ll link the (2:53 - 2:56)
article in the show notes but it&#39;s (2:54 - 3:00)
famitsu if for those not familiar is a (2:56 - 3:02)
Japanese Japanese magazine that because (3:00 - 3:04)
magazines don&#39;t really exist anymore (3:02 - 3:06)
they also a Japanese website that (3:04 - 3:09)
publishes there it&#39;s like Japan&#39;s IGN (3:06 - 3:11)
but that&#39;s like a real big (3:09 - 3:15)
disservice I don&#39;t Japan&#39;s Game Informer (3:11 - 3:16)
that also seems bad because I don&#39;t (3:15 - 3:19)
think a lot of people Japan&#39;s game pro (3:16 - 3:20)
even though it&#39;s not around anymore game (3:19 - 3:23)
pro I think people liked oh egm people (3:20 - 3:25)
really liked (3:23 - 3:28)
egm back in the day like I what you&#39;re (3:25 - 3:32)
talking about not that one (3:28 - 3:32)
so there was an (3:33 - 3:37)
interview I hit the little translate (3:35 - 3:41)
button it&#39;s it&#39;s 2024 that translate (3:37 - 3:42)
button on a website does not work as (3:41 - 3:45)
good as you would you would think does (3:42 - 3:47)
work better than used to though that&#39;s (3:45 - 3:49)
true true uh (3:47 - 3:53)
so two sentences I pulled here uh the (3:49 - 3:55)
first one (3:53 - 3:59)
again translate through Google slapple (3:55 - 4:00)
whatever the little button on the top of (3:59 - 4:03)
the browser does uh at the time of first (4:00 - 4:05)
contract it was decided that select (4:03 - 4:07)
button would leave development after a (4:05 - 4:10)
certain period of time as for our (4:07 - 4:13)
company we want to do we want to do it (4:10 - 4:15)
together more but the reason we talked (4:13 - 4:18)
about at the beginning of hero and the (4:15 - 4:20)
same as king koyi uh those are the other (4:18 - 4:22)
two games they did and I think King koyi (4:20 - 4:25)
actually is Magikarp jump (4:22 - 4:28)
um that last sentence doesn&#39;t make sense (4:25 - 4:30)
uh as for our company we wanted to do (4:28 - 4:32)
together (4:30 - 4:36)
more just Google translate um so I guess (4:32 - 4:39)
the takeaway from this is this wasn&#39;t (4:36 - 4:42)
like the Pokemon company being unhappy (4:39 - 4:44)
with Select (4:42 - 4:45)
Bus (4:44 - 4:50)
right yeah yeah yeah they&#39;re like you (4:45 - 4:51)
have too much communication with your (4:50 - 4:53)
fan base we&#39;re taking it away from you (4:51 - 4:56)
no that that was my my first reaction (4:53 - 4:58)
was oh this makes sense why they have (4:56 - 4:59)
been so good at communication and have (4:58 - 5:01)
been giving such good gifts to the (4:59 - 5:03)
community because they are not going to (5:01 - 5:04)
be the ones who are blamed when it gets (5:03 - 5:06)
worse as the game goes (5:04 - 5:13)
on like our hands are clean it&#39;s problem (5:06 - 5:13)
now the other sentence I pulled um again (5:14 - 5:23)
Google translate uh it says I don&#39;t (5:20 - 5:25)
think select button is the one who keeps (5:23 - 5:27)
doing the same thing and I think we can (5:25 - 5:30)
take A New Path to be honest I didn&#39;t (5:27 - 5:32)
expect to be followed by Pokemon sleep (5:30 - 5:35)
for so long uh it&#39;s been way long to go (5:32 - 5:38)
until release in that sense we have been (5:35 - 5:41)
able to help you for uh help you for too (5:38 - 5:43)
long this sounds very negative but again (5:41 - 5:46)
Google translate so we are enthusiastic (5:43 - 5:48)
that we must do our best to prepare a (5:46 - 5:53)
long-term system to repay it um my true (5:48 - 5:56)
feeling is that I&#39;m lonely laughs thanks (5:53 - 5:58)
Google translate yeah Google translate (5:56 - 6:02)
not great there there I mean it&#39;s mostly (5:58 - 6:03)
just them saying that they worked on the (6:02 - 6:06)
game longer than they had expected to (6:03 - 6:09)
yeah um there&#39;s some other things from (6:06 - 6:14)
it uh the actual interview is three (6:09 - 6:16)
Pokemon from select or three employees (6:14 - 6:19)
from select three there was a Snorlax (6:16 - 6:23)
that showed up trench coat do this (6:19 - 6:26)
interview it&#39;s crazy that&#39;s why I never (6:23 - 6:27)
that&#39;s why they never translated it they (6:26 - 6:30)
would want to know kaby gone is sit (6:27 - 6:32)
there um so it was like three people (6:30 - 6:33)
from select (6:32 - 6:37)
button uh the somebody from the Pokemon (6:33 - 6:39)
company and then I think the other one (6:37 - 6:40)
was like somebody from like Pokemon (6:39 - 6:42)
works it was like f it was like a five (6:40 - 6:44)
person interview again it&#39;s in the show (6:42 - 6:48)
notes they also like talked about how (6:44 - 6:49)
they were like really proud of the (6:48 - 6:52)
legendary event and then the interviewee (6:49 - 6:53)
was like are there more legendaries (6:52 - 6:56)
coming and they were like of course but (6:53 - 7:00)
we won&#39;t talk about that um (6:56 - 7:02)
they talked about like the Apple watch (7:00 - 7:05)
integration um and then they the other (7:02 - 7:06)
thing the other like takeaway from this (7:05 - 7:09)
poorly translated interview is that they (7:06 - 7:11)
want to make sure that Pokemon sleep (7:09 - 7:14)
makes it to all a thousand plus Pokemon (7:11 - 7:16)
like that is that was one of their goals (7:14 - 7:19)
is the wow oh and then another thing (7:16 - 7:21)
sorry is they really wanted to make sure (7:19 - 7:24)
that lapis and power plant (7:21 - 7:27)
felt different when you got there mhm (7:24 - 7:29)
and they they they kind of went in with (7:27 - 7:32)
like color and like how the like how (7:29 - 7:34)
they feel different when you get there (7:32 - 7:38)
for the first time um other than just a (7:34 - 7:39)
bunch of Rattata showing up the first (7:38 - 7:44)
few days that you sleep yeah no they do (7:39 - 7:45)
I think that they hit on that though I (7:44 - 7:47)
think that they they well I haven&#39;t been (7:45 - 7:49)
to power plant yet but from what I&#39;ve (7:47 - 7:52)
seen it does they definitely seem (7:49 - 7:54)
different everything seems unique (7:52 - 7:56)
especially they make every see (7:54 - 7:57)
everything seem unique with just the (7:56 - 7:59)
music alone honestly like if you&#39;re (7:57 - 8:01)
playing with sound on like that in (7:59 - 8:04)
itself does make uh a big difference (8:01 - 8:06)
when you&#39;re going from place to place (8:04 - 8:08)
none are as good as topalo music but you (8:06 - 8:13)
know that&#39;s a different (8:08 - 8:13)
conversation are are you both still (8:14 - 8:21)
playing sleep (8:17 - 8:21)
daily wait what are you both still (8:21 - 8:27)
playing sleep Hannah you&#39;re not though (8:25 - 8:30)
no for our audio listeners Hannah just (8:27 - 8:32)
shook her head I I shook my head in a (8:30 - 8:34)
very small way because I feel like I (8:32 - 8:38)
should be but this game doesn&#39;t capture (8:34 - 8:40)
me the way that I want it to let (8:38 - 8:43)
he give us the complaints I&#39;ve been (8:40 - 8:46)
saying it I have nothing new that I (8:43 - 8:48)
haven&#39;t already said I just am not (8:46 - 8:51)
interested in the morning and it just as (8:48 - 8:53)
soon as something gets harder in my life (8:51 - 8:56)
like work picks up for a week I drop off (8:53 - 9:00)
because I need more sleep and and then I (8:56 - 9:02)
wake up and immediately have to get to (9:00 - 9:04)
my desk and playing Pokemon sleep in the (9:02 - 9:08)
morning you&#39;re it it&#39;s not it&#39;s taking (9:04 - 9:10)
it away waking up to play Pokemon sleep (9:08 - 9:12)
first thing in the morning is taking (9:10 - 9:14)
away 10 minutes of sleep that I could be (9:12 - 9:18)
getting that&#39;s true but yeah I did play (9:14 - 9:20)
it this morning and I learned how many (9:18 - 9:23)
days of research you can backlog before (9:20 - 9:27)
it starts dropping them off like you can (9:23 - 9:30)
cover the research for 15 days (9:27 - 9:35)
and no longer cut it off yep interesting (9:30 - 9:38)
wow well if Hannah&#39;s on your friends (9:35 - 9:40)
list maybe consider getting somebody new (9:38 - 9:43)
if you want that daily candy yeah that&#39;s (9:40 - 9:45)
probably a safe bet at this point I will (9:43 - 9:48)
open it occasionally and I when I opened (9:45 - 9:50)
it it felt kind of nostalgic coming back (9:48 - 9:53)
to the game after more than 15 days this (9:50 - 9:55)
morning (9:53 - 9:58)
um but especially they just released (9:55 - 10:00)
sneez in the game and that&#39;s one of my (9:58 - 10:02)
favorite Pokémon and if that didn&#39;t (10:00 - 10:03)
bring me (10:02 - 10:07)
back I think I think um (10:03 - 10:10)
it&#39;s it&#39;s an occasional open for me yeah (10:07 - 10:14)
okay all right that I fine I I I feel (10:10 - 10:16)
like I&#39;ve had a change of heart with (10:14 - 10:20)
Pokemon sleep recently oh what yeah it&#39;s (10:16 - 10:23)
because of the yoka news it just it I (10:20 - 10:27)
can&#39;t I can&#39;t touch another Ela game (10:23 - 10:30)
um uh I I I really think it&#39;s funny (10:27 - 10:32)
because the developers talk about how (10:30 - 10:35)
like they wanted to make Lapis and and (10:32 - 10:37)
power plant like different and how they (10:35 - 10:38)
wanted people to feel like they&#39;ve (10:37 - 10:40)
accomplished something from getting (10:38 - 10:44)
there uh and I think I feel the opposite (10:40 - 10:45)
as a (10:44 - 10:47)
player (10:45 - 10:50)
and I think what really broke me which (10:47 - 10:52)
is funny because like for if if You&#39; (10:50 - 10:54)
listened to the show for like the last (10:52 - 10:56)
year you you know that like Pokemon (10:54 - 10:58)
sleep was something I I raved about and (10:56 - 11:01)
I I loved and I adored (10:58 - 11:03)
but when when uh I made it to the power (11:01 - 11:06)
plant which was the very first week and (11:03 - 11:08)
I&#39;ve done nothing but Power Plant since (11:06 - 11:10)
minus the one week where they were like (11:08 - 11:11)
you have to go to the Halloween event (11:10 - 11:12)
you have to go to green grass for the (11:11 - 11:14)
Halloween event and then this past week (11:12 - 11:16)
I went to snow drop for sneez didn&#39;t get (11:14 - 11:18)
a steel by the way for this whole week (11:16 - 11:22)
same uh that but don&#39;t worry Master 6 (11:18 - 11:24)
got me a Bells Sprout not sure why (11:22 - 11:27)
Bellsprout spawning in the tundra also (11:24 - 11:31)
I&#39;m at Master 6 and sure okay but I (11:27 - 11:34)
think what broke me (11:31 - 11:34)
was (11:34 - 11:37)
how like much time you have to put into (11:37 - 11:44)
it and still not feel rewarded uh and (11:40 - 11:46)
what I mean by that is like I&#39;m not a (11:44 - 11:48)
min max player if you go to like the (11:46 - 11:51)
Pokemon sleep subreddit uh or you go to (11:48 - 11:53)
that one site like Ray Ray next or (11:51 - 11:54)
whatever it&#39;s called where like the (11:53 - 11:57)
calculator site yeah like there is a (11:54 - 12:00)
hardcore community that is the Min (11:57 - 12:02)
maxing everything I&#39;m I&#39;m not a minmax (12:00 - 12:05)
player like I have a couple I was very (12:02 - 12:06)
lucky with a couple (12:05 - 12:10)
Pokemon but if I if I get like a B plus (12:06 - 12:12)
Pokemon or an A minus I&#39;ll Crank that (12:10 - 12:14)
baby up especially because like if it&#39;s (12:12 - 12:16)
something like a a Kangaskhan or a ditto (12:14 - 12:19)
or Den like how often are you seeing (12:16 - 12:23)
those Pokemon like yeah uh and I I say (12:19 - 12:25)
this all the time I will say it again (12:23 - 12:27)
how long has lapis lik side been out (12:25 - 12:28)
still don&#39;t have a perfect still don&#39;t (12:27 - 12:30)
have a good rout it&#39;s not even like a B (12:28 - 12:33)
minus routes all my routes are bad so (12:30 - 12:35)
what broke me is was going to power (12:33 - 12:38)
plant I saved up a lot of free gems I (12:35 - 12:42)
got some of the bundles and I saw 17 (12:38 - 12:44)
shins (12:42 - 12:48)
since uh Nat saw caught 17 17 shins (12:44 - 12:53)
since power plant came out 14 Aon 13 (12:48 - 12:57)
grubbin that&#39;s over 30 some Pokemon M (12:53 - 13:00)
and none of those Pok (12:57 - 13:05)
are good yep none of them and sounds (13:00 - 13:08)
about right my 13 grubin none of them (13:05 - 13:13)
were ingredient up none of them dang (13:08 - 13:16)
that&#39;s so I think that&#39;s (13:13 - 13:19)
like that&#39;s I feel like what broke me (13:16 - 13:23)
because grubbin broke (13:19 - 13:26)
you because not not only are you looking (13:23 - 13:29)
for ideal Natures for certain Pokemon (13:26 - 13:31)
but you&#39;re looking for ideal stats but (13:29 - 13:34)
on top of that you&#39;re looking for (13:31 - 13:38)
ideal uh ingredients right like too many (13:34 - 13:41)
factors yeah exactly there are too many (13:38 - 13:43)
factors and when that week was over or (13:41 - 13:46)
not that week when when five six seven (13:43 - 13:48)
weeks of power plan is over the other (13:46 - 13:50)
thing I couldn&#39;t help thinking about is (13:48 - 13:53)
like none of these Pokemon are hungry (13:50 - 13:55)
ever yeah like I woke up this morning (13:53 - 13:57)
and the thing that was hungry I&#39;m not (13:55 - 13:59)
I&#39;m not even making this up the thing (13:57 - 14:01)
that was h was the (13:59 - 14:04)
Bellsprout not the ditto not the glacon (14:01 - 14:06)
not the Marie the Bellsprout was hungry (14:04 - 14:08)
so it&#39;s (14:06 - 14:11)
like I still I&#39;m still on premium pass (14:08 - 14:13)
and then uh I thought to (14:11 - 14:16)
myself if I actually wanted to catch (14:13 - 14:18)
more Pokemon a day so like I caught a (14:16 - 14:20)
Marie this morning I used my premium (14:18 - 14:22)
biscuit that&#39;s four I used a pokey (14:20 - 14:24)
biscuit that&#39;s one cool caught the Marie (14:22 - 14:27)
still don&#39;t like I don&#39;t I have like a c (14:24 - 14:30)
Aeros but it&#39;s good it has very finding (14:27 - 14:32)
fine whatever good it has helped me (14:30 - 14:33)
through the electric event but like (14:32 - 14:35)
maybe I could get a better Marie was the (14:33 - 14:36)
best option out of (14:35 - 14:39)
[Laughter] (14:36 - 14:43)
everything if I just wanted to catch (14:39 - 14:45)
like the Riolu standing next to the mie (14:43 - 14:47)
which real is a bad Pokemon you (14:45 - 14:50)
shouldn&#39;t catch my my option is five (14:47 - 14:55)
pokeballs yeah and I have 10 so I want (14:50 - 14:58)
to spend half my resources on a Riolu (14:55 - 15:00)
that&#39;s probably going to be as bad as (14:58 - 15:02)
all the mar all the all the the grubbin (15:00 - 15:05)
I caught all the Aeron I caught all the (15:02 - 15:08)
Shins I caught like there&#39;s (15:05 - 15:12)
no you just get tired of it yeah like (15:08 - 15:16)
the resources in the game are too low (15:12 - 15:19)
and the randomization is too high like (15:16 - 15:22)
if I could just catch more Pokemon I (15:19 - 15:24)
probably would feel less bad but I think (15:22 - 15:27)
an average player and I don&#39;t even (15:24 - 15:28)
consider myself an average player (15:27 - 15:31)
because I have premium (15:28 - 15:33)
pass an average player is what catching (15:31 - 15:37)
maybe one Pokemon a night maybe maybe (15:33 - 15:39)
yeah as someone who hasn&#39;t had the (15:37 - 15:42)
premium pass it&#39;s one every other night (15:39 - 15:46)
at best what is the not premium biscuit (15:42 - 15:47)
get you does it get you three do you get (15:46 - 15:50)
one biscuit that gives you three a day (15:47 - 15:53)
okay (15:50 - 15:57)
so like I get why mints aren&#39;t a thing (15:53 - 15:58)
cuz they want you to keep catching (15:57 - 15:59)
Pokemon but if I could catch more (15:58 - 16:01)
Pokémon I would feel less bad if more (15:59 - 16:04)
Pokémon were just hungry that would also (16:01 - 16:06)
help but I think another thing that (16:04 - 16:10)
broke me was sneez sneez is like 16 (16:06 - 16:14)
ticks is it really yeah so sneez is yep (16:10 - 16:17)
yep so if sneez showed up in tundra (16:14 - 16:20)
which it didn&#39;t by the way and it wasn&#39;t (16:17 - 16:25)
hungry what I have 15 pokeballs yep yep (16:20 - 16:28)
I can&#39;t even catch sneez and and it&#39;s (16:25 - 16:30)
gonna get full (16:28 - 16:32)
yeah after the second Poco after the (16:30 - 16:34)
second biscuit everything is 50/50 it&#39;s (16:32 - 16:36)
either full or it&#39;s not it&#39;s either full (16:34 - 16:37)
or not that&#39;s how it works it&#39;s just (16:36 - 16:39)
5050 after this after the second biscuit (16:37 - 16:41)
oh is that what it is is it just a coin (16:39 - 16:42)
flip basically yeah it&#39;s just a coin (16:41 - 16:44)
flip every biscuit after the second one (16:42 - 16:47)
oh good not good to know just cool great (16:44 - 16:50)
information okay La last thing that (16:47 - 16:51)
broke (16:50 - 16:53)
me is (16:51 - 16:57)
Den so because I&#39;ve been on power plant (16:53 - 17:00)
so much m i fck finally started seeing (16:57 - 17:04)
Den yeah like prior to this I probably (17:00 - 17:06)
saw maybe four (17:04 - 17:11)
Den MH and the all bad all bad but like (17:06 - 17:14)
I like Den as a Pokemon I I still think (17:11 - 17:18)
Den&#39;s main skill is awesome like (17:14 - 17:20)
increasing (17:18 - 17:22)
crit and you know what&#39;s worse than not (17:20 - 17:26)
seeing Den is seeing multiple Den in a (17:22 - 17:28)
week and them never being hungry and (17:26 - 17:29)
then like what&#39;s your option at that (17:28 - 17:32)
point like I guess I&#39;ll give it a poke (17:29 - 17:36)
ball and now cool it&#39;s it&#39;s 15 more (17:32 - 17:38)
ticks to go or actually I think Den is (17:36 - 17:39)
more than 16 you&#39;re investing for the (17:38 - 17:43)
long run this is not a fastpaced game (17:39 - 17:45)
yeah and eventually that just gets (17:43 - 17:48)
tiring well because because I think that (17:45 - 17:50)
what you have said about it being the (17:48 - 17:53)
catching being too slow and the (17:50 - 17:55)
randomization being too high is (17:53 - 17:57)
absolutely the balance that I&#39;m having (17:55 - 17:59)
trouble with too it just you you are (17:57 - 18:01)
never getting the Pokemon that you want (17:59 - 18:03)
and it takes too long to get any Pokemon (18:01 - 18:08)
at all and so if they lowered the (18:03 - 18:10)
randomization sum by being able to (18:08 - 18:13)
guarantee better Pokemon in some way (18:10 - 18:15)
that would probably help or if they just (18:13 - 18:18)
made it so you could catch more Pokemon (18:15 - 18:19)
that would also probably help but the (18:18 - 18:21)
balance where it&#39;s at right now is not (18:19 - 18:23)
good I guess I think if more Pokemon (18:21 - 18:27)
were hungry it fixes that a little bit I (18:23 - 18:28)
mean some because you&#39;re cuz you&#39;re (18:27 - 18:31)
going from like five Pokeball to like (18:28 - 18:32)
three plus a hungry Pokemon has a higher (18:31 - 18:35)
chance for like crit catch yeah I mean (18:32 - 18:38)
it speeds up catching some yes but I I (18:35 - 18:42)
do think there has to be some rework I (18:38 - 18:44)
can&#39;t be I know this this sounds like a (18:42 - 18:47)
very much like you having a relationship (18:44 - 18:48)
with somebody for like two years and (18:47 - 18:49)
being like I love everything about them (18:48 - 18:51)
and as soon as you guys like break up (18:49 - 18:52)
you&#39;re like this is what I hate and I (18:51 - 18:54)
hated this and I hate when they do this (18:52 - 18:57)
this is what that feels like to (18:54 - 18:57)
me um are you breaking up with Pokemon (18:57 - 19:02)
sleep like I I still like it I think I (19:03 - 19:08)
love the graphics I love that it it&#39;s (19:06 - 19:10)
not asking a lot for me I do like the (19:08 - 19:13)
routine of it um I like that the numbers (19:10 - 19:15)
get bigger I do like the Pokemon that (19:13 - 19:18)
I&#39;ve invested in but all of these things (19:15 - 19:19)
of (19:18 - 19:23)
like you would think that like being on (19:19 - 19:26)
power plan and being level 60 and and (19:23 - 19:27)
doing all this would (19:26 - 19:31)
like it just it just feels like none of (19:27 - 19:34)
my progress in the last n uh 18 months (19:31 - 19:37)
or whatever has really mattered because (19:34 - 19:39)
everything is just as random as it was (19:37 - 19:42)
from day one and resources are just as (19:39 - 19:45)
tight as they were since day one yeah I (19:42 - 19:47)
get that I think I have a little bit of (19:45 - 19:49)
a different perspective than both of you (19:47 - 19:50)
uh maybe because I came into the game (19:49 - 19:52)
later so I haven&#39;t been playing as long (19:50 - 19:54)
as both of you but I&#39;m also a little bi (19:52 - 19:56)
biased this week because I did catch a (19:54 - 19:58)
shiny Ditto and a non shiny but a deli (19:56 - 20:02)
bird on Tundra this week so that was (19:58 - 20:06)
fun Bobby the pocket of mil like this (20:02 - 20:08)
give the man a shiny he&#39;ll love our (20:06 - 20:11)
game but um and neither of them were bad (20:08 - 20:13)
either I was kind of happy about that (20:11 - 20:15)
they were they weren&#39;t bad but uh for me (20:13 - 20:19)
what&#39;s interesting is that what I&#39;ve (20:15 - 20:21)
kind of done is I&#39;ve kind of stuck to a (20:19 - 20:23)
specific team for quite some time now (20:21 - 20:28)
yeah because of I&#39;ve built up the close (20:23 - 20:30)
to one of the like the most um one of (20:28 - 20:32)
the meals that get you the most points (20:30 - 20:34)
so I&#39;ve kind of just stuck to the same (20:32 - 20:37)
team for quite a while like it&#39;s I just (20:34 - 20:39)
haven&#39;t really been changing it up (20:37 - 20:43)
so I&#39;ve kind of seen this game as not (20:39 - 20:45)
like I&#39;m not putting as much like I&#39;m (20:43 - 20:47)
still opening it every day and if I miss (20:45 - 20:49)
a meal or something like whatever I miss (20:47 - 20:51)
a meal like I&#39;m I&#39;m really not giving it (20:49 - 20:53)
a whole lot of like At first I was like (20:51 - 20:54)
oh my gosh I missed a meal this is (20:53 - 20:56)
ridiculous like I can&#39;t believe you know (20:54 - 20:58)
and now it&#39;s just like it happens you (20:56 - 21:00)
know like I (20:58 - 21:02)
I I definitely am not playing it as much (21:00 - 21:05)
as I was and one of the things I did (21:02 - 21:07)
because I had I had Pokemon sleep on my (21:05 - 21:10)
home screen along with Pokémon go and (21:07 - 21:12)
then when pocket came out I didn&#39;t have (21:10 - 21:14)
room on my home screen for all three (21:12 - 21:16)
based on like how I have my home screen (21:14 - 21:18)
uh formatted so what I did was I ended (21:16 - 21:22)
up actually making a shortcut as an app (21:18 - 21:23)
icon and so now I actually have to do (21:22 - 21:24)
one click and then I have to choose (21:23 - 21:26)
which game I want to go into and I was (21:24 - 21:29)
thinking like if I do this well I open (21:26 - 21:31)
these apps less because like it&#39;s not (21:29 - 21:33)
sitting right on the home (21:31 - 21:35)
screen and I and I do open these apps (21:33 - 21:39)
less but in like not a bad way right (21:35 - 21:41)
like in a way of like I&#39;m still enjoying (21:39 - 21:43)
playing Pokemon sleep because I&#39;m not (21:41 - 21:46)
playing it as much so when I&#39;m playing (21:43 - 21:48)
it I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m playing it out (21:46 - 21:51)
of necessity to play I don&#39;t feel like I (21:48 - 21:52)
like oh I saw it on my home screen I (21:51 - 21:53)
opened it now I&#39;m opening it now I&#39;m in (21:52 - 21:58)
it like I feel like I&#39;m I&#39;m um choosing (21:53 - 22:01)
to go play it and it might just be for a (21:58 - 22:03)
moment to like collect ingredients or (22:01 - 22:04)
whatever or it might be because it&#39;s the (22:03 - 22:06)
morning I also don&#39;t play it like as (22:04 - 22:08)
soon as I wake up it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t (22:06 - 22:10)
open my phone as soon as I wake up um (22:08 - 22:12)
I&#39;ll usually like hit the Pokeball to (22:10 - 22:14)
wake that up but then I&#39;ll wait a couple (22:12 - 22:16)
hours before like I&#39;ll be like oh I got (22:14 - 22:17)
to go do this before like it hits (22:16 - 22:20)
lunchtime um when I have a few minutes (22:17 - 22:23)
so I&#39;m definitely playing the game (22:20 - 22:25)
differently um I wouldn&#39;t say that (22:23 - 22:27)
I like (22:25 - 22:31)
it less than before it&#39;s just that (22:27 - 22:33)
because I&#39;m not playing it as (22:31 - 22:39)
much it doesn&#39;t feel as needy as it did (22:33 - 22:42)
before yeah my first reaction is that (22:39 - 22:43)
that&#39;s the first step to dropping the (22:42 - 22:46)
game eventually possibly possibly and (22:43 - 22:48)
that&#39;s and that&#39;s fine but the thing (22:46 - 22:51)
that&#39;s different is that I like just a (22:48 - 22:52)
few weeks ago we were talking about how (22:51 - 22:53)
I was like I I open the game and it (22:52 - 22:55)
feels like you&#39;re opening it and not (22:53 - 22:58)
super happy with it with opening it but (22:55 - 23:00)
now it&#39;s like when I open it I&#39;m like (22:58 - 23:02)
I&#39;m not opening it as often and so when (23:00 - 23:05)
I am opening it I am like happier (23:02 - 23:07)
playing the game and so yeah maybe that (23:05 - 23:09)
leads to like me not you know playing it (23:07 - 23:12)
at one point but for now I guess I&#39;m (23:09 - 23:14)
just not expecting as much out of it (23:12 - 23:17)
anymore because I know it&#39;s like a much (23:14 - 23:20)
slower paced game than and I don&#39;t mean (23:17 - 23:21)
that in a bad way I just mean that it&#39;s (23:20 - 23:24)
a much slower paced game than the other (23:21 - 23:26)
Pokemon mobile games on my phone right (23:24 - 23:27)
it&#39;s slower paced than pocket it&#39;s (23:26 - 23:29)
slower paced than go for sure (23:27 - 23:33)
and I&#39;m not a minmax player as well um (23:29 - 23:35)
that Pokemon sleep Reddit is wild if you (23:33 - 23:37)
ever go on to that subreddit it is (23:35 - 23:40)
there&#39;s a whole lot going on in there uh (23:37 - 23:42)
you know I complained about that (23:40 - 23:45)
Reddit like pretty quickly like yeah (23:42 - 23:48)
when the game came out on this podcast (23:45 - 23:49)
we I complained about the Reddit and (23:48 - 23:51)
there were people from the Reddit that (23:49 - 23:53)
came to the YouTube comments to be like (23:51 - 23:55)
no you don&#39;t understand the rules and (23:53 - 23:57)
one of like the rules was like they (23:55 - 24:02)
deleted like any post with shinies yeah (23:57 - 24:03)
uh even if it was like a helpful post (24:02 - 24:05)
and there was like a shiny charizard (24:03 - 24:07)
foot in like the corner of the image (24:05 - 24:08)
they would like delete it because they (24:07 - 24:11)
didn&#39;t want people to yeah cu the people (24:08 - 24:12)
that they didn&#39;t want people to like (24:11 - 24:15)
feel bad or whatever yeah but like and (24:12 - 24:16)
my argument I think at the time was like (24:15 - 24:18)
it&#39;s Reddit if you don&#39;t want to see the (24:16 - 24:20)
post downvote it and then just move on (24:18 - 24:22)
with life like that&#39;s it and then if if (24:20 - 24:24)
if things get downvoted then that (24:22 - 24:27)
doesn&#39;t and and now they have shiny post (24:24 - 24:29)
all the time on that subreddit yeah well (24:27 - 24:31)
I think Pokémon go went through that (24:29 - 24:32)
same thing I think the Pokémon go (24:31 - 24:34)
subredit and maybe the sil Road as well (24:32 - 24:36)
definitely had periods of time where it (24:34 - 24:38)
was like no more shinies don&#39;t post any (24:36 - 24:39)
shinies anymore and then a few weeks (24:38 - 24:41)
later it&#39;d be like well we took the (24:39 - 24:43)
shiny ban away and now people can post (24:41 - 24:45)
them again and then it&#39;d be like a new (24:43 - 24:47)
wave a year later like stop posting (24:45 - 24:49)
shinies you know it&#39;s just I mean I mean (24:47 - 24:50)
half the post of the Pokemon sleep (24:49 - 24:53)
subreddit are like I got two Pikachu (24:50 - 24:55)
like which one do you think is better (24:53 - 24:56)
and then the comments are just like (24:55 - 24:59)
these are both bad yep it&#39;s like every (24:56 - 25:02)
like 90% of comparing these Pokemon just (24:59 - 25:03)
go to the comment and the top comment is (25:02 - 25:05)
both of these are bad keep looking (25:03 - 25:10)
yeah yeah but eventually you need to use (25:05 - 25:12)
one of them so even if they&#39;re both bad (25:10 - 25:14)
that&#39;s the problem they&#39;re always bad (25:12 - 25:17)
yeah (25:14 - 25:21)
um I I will stick with Pokemon sleep I (25:17 - 25:25)
still do like it I I think there the I (25:21 - 25:28)
think the honeymoon phase of Pokemon (25:25 - 25:32)
sleep is over for me it&#39;s been long I I (25:28 - 25:35)
do hope that like the Christmas event is (25:32 - 25:36)
really good because it was pretty good (25:35 - 25:39)
last year um and I&#39;m assuming for (25:36 - 25:41)
Pokemon day there will be a Pokemon (25:39 - 25:43)
sleep update I&#39;m sure Pokemon day is (25:41 - 25:45)
where they would show new legendaries (25:43 - 25:46)
knowing them it would probably be (25:45 - 25:50)
Articuno zaptos mol trce right like or (25:46 - 25:52)
interesting to hear you say that to hear (25:50 - 25:54)
you talk about the the Christmas event (25:52 - 25:56)
or the holiday event because and the (25:54 - 25:57)
Halloween event I would say people (25:56 - 25:59)
probably thought that that was pretty (25:57 - 26:00)
good like not great maybe but it was (25:59 - 26:04)
pretty good this is exactly the same way (26:00 - 26:07)
that people were reacting to Pokémon go (26:04 - 26:11)
the year after its first year so people (26:07 - 26:15)
got to this part like Autumn time frame (26:11 - 26:19)
or spring down under um and uh it was (26:15 - 26:22)
like oh I&#39;m pretty bored of the game but (26:19 - 26:24)
hey the Halloween events coming up that (26:22 - 26:25)
was really great last year so maybe (26:24 - 26:26)
that&#39;ll push me back into hey the (26:25 - 26:28)
holiday event was great last year maybe (26:26 - 26:30)
that&#39;ll push me back into it and those (26:28 - 26:32)
do continue to be if you think about it (26:30 - 26:34)
in Pokémon go those continue to be the (26:32 - 26:37)
events that people are like well the (26:34 - 26:38)
Halloween event coming up like (26:37 - 26:39)
everybody&#39;s got to get ready for the (26:38 - 26:41)
Halloween event oh the holiday event&#39;s (26:39 - 26:43)
coming up like everybody&#39;s gotta get (26:41 - 26:45)
ready for the winter holiday event uh (26:43 - 26:47)
and so it&#39;s interesting to see that (26:45 - 26:50)
pattern in another game another Pokemon (26:47 - 26:52)
game where it&#39;s like well the holiday (26:50 - 26:54)
events coming up like maybe that&#39;ll like (26:52 - 26:56)
that&#39;s a good one so that&#39;ll push me (26:54 - 26:57)
back (26:56 - 26:59)
intock the same way the new booster (26:57 - 27:03)
packs will get me back in (26:59 - 27:06)
yeah this is how they these work it&#39;s (27:03 - 27:07)
how it works with the physical (27:06 - 27:11)
merchandise too true very true (27:07 - 27:13)
yeah the last thing I&#39;ll say before we (27:11 - 27:17)
take a break is the part so select (27:13 - 27:19)
button says like we didn&#39;t expect to (27:17 - 27:21)
work on Pokemon sleep forever we want to (27:19 - 27:24)
do different things I heard a rumor I&#39;m (27:21 - 27:25)
going to really really want to stress (27:24 - 27:28)
rumor I have no Source I don&#39;t know (27:25 - 27:31)
where this came from it could have just (27:28 - 27:34)
been somebody on MySpace (27:31 - 27:37)
posting but it came out the same time as (27:34 - 27:40)
this the rumor was that the Pokemon (27:37 - 27:43)
company wanted SE wants select button to (27:40 - 27:45)
work on another Pokemon (27:43 - 27:48)
game and so if they&#39;re done with the (27:45 - 27:50)
development this is why Pokemon Works (27:48 - 27:53)
exists obviously Pokemon Works was (27:50 - 27:56)
created before this announcement uh (27:53 - 27:58)
select button came out and said this was (27:56 - 28:00)
always the plan to pass it over to (27:58 - 28:03)
ilka so they made magic Pokemon sleep (28:00 - 28:04)
team made Magikarp jump they made (28:03 - 28:06)
Pokemon (28:04 - 28:09)
sleep if the Pokemon company is happy (28:06 - 28:11)
with select button as developers because (28:09 - 28:12)
I think both those games are great at (28:11 - 28:16)
their core like everything it would be I (28:12 - 28:18)
would love to see another Pokemon game (28:16 - 28:21)
from select button would love to see it (28:18 - 28:26)
uh 100% like uh do I do I want ilka to (28:21 - 28:29)
take over development no not really but (28:26 - 28:32)
if if that means that Pokemon the the (28:29 - 28:33)
the team of select button is going to (28:32 - 28:36)
work on a new Pokemon game that sounds (28:33 - 28:38)
awesome uh but there&#39;s like nothing to (28:36 - 28:41)
like Sol there&#39;s not like an ounce to (28:38 - 28:44)
solidify how real that that rumor is but (28:41 - 28:47)
it it is like nice to think (28:44 - 28:51)
about yeah although who knows if if ilka (28:47 - 28:54)
is becoming the stewards of any ongoing (28:51 - 28:59)
Pokemon service other than go um (28:54 - 29:02)
maybe whatever they work on next after (28:59 - 29:05)
Pokemon sleep whatever select button (29:02 - 29:06)
works on next after Pokemon sleep will (29:05 - 29:08)
be handed over to them eventually as (29:06 - 29:11)
well eventually yeah yeah I mean I will (29:08 - 29:14)
say because Ela well they did home right (29:11 - 29:17)
they they&#39;re developing home and then (29:14 - 29:20)
they did brilliant Diamond shining Pearl (29:17 - 29:25)
yeah MH okay so there so as of right now (29:20 - 29:26)
we know that IL is interesting track (29:25 - 29:29)
record home yeah (29:26 - 29:32)
Diamond pearl and sleep and then they (29:29 - 29:34)
make their own games so they&#39;ve made (29:32 - 29:36)
mobile games and then they came out with (29:34 - 29:39)
like sand land game which is like some (29:36 - 29:45)
anime was the game okay um so at least (29:39 - 29:48)
in this case it&#39;s not like Ela started (29:45 - 29:50)
this game right they&#39;re just taking over (29:48 - 29:52)
what&#39;s already built and going to build (29:50 - 29:55)
upon that I would assume in the future (29:52 - 29:58)
but I mean with sleep I mean uh but at (29:55 - 30:01)
least it&#39;s not like they built it from (29:58 - 30:04)
the ground up you know there&#39;s something (30:01 - 30:06)
different about that I guess I don&#39;t (30:04 - 30:08)
know I&#39;m kind of hearing that they&#39;re (30:06 - 30:11)
taking over and they are going to keep (30:08 - 30:13)
running with what the game is for now (30:11 - 30:15)
while we also are kind of hitting a (30:13 - 30:17)
point where we feel like things in the (30:15 - 30:19)
game kind of need to be changed if it&#39;s (30:17 - 30:21)
going to continue and I&#39;m a little bit (30:19 - 30:23)
worried that as ilka takes over as (30:21 - 30:25)
Pokemon Works takes over it&#39;s just going (30:23 - 30:28)
to kind of continue as is and kind of (30:25 - 30:32)
drag along when there are changes that (30:28 - 30:34)
could be made to make it better and I&#39;m (30:32 - 30:36)
I&#39;m just not sure they&#39;re going to be (30:34 - 30:39)
able to make those changes I mean yeah (30:36 - 30:41)
that is true because we haven&#39;t seen (30:39 - 30:45)
very helpful big updates to Pokemon home (30:41 - 30:48)
over the years there have been (30:45 - 30:48)
some but (30:49 - 30:54)
yeah that&#39;s true I don&#39;t know did (30:52 - 30:57)
Magikarp jump not that that went TOA but (30:54 - 30:58)
did Magikarp jump ever have any (30:57 - 31:00)
meaningful like updates to it or was it (30:58 - 31:02)
pretty much a game that you just start (31:00 - 31:04)
like started and finished and then you (31:02 - 31:06)
were kind of done once you were done um (31:04 - 31:08)
I think there was one big update where (31:06 - 31:11)
they added like 20 or 30 more levels or (31:08 - 31:14)
something like that I think so where you (31:11 - 31:17)
could one yeah I couldn&#39;t remember (31:14 - 31:20)
okay yeah I it&#39;s tough with sleep (31:17 - 31:23)
because you know there&#39;s a premium pass (31:20 - 31:24)
right it&#39;s a little different where it&#39;s (31:23 - 31:27)
like you can&#39;t have a game that I mean (31:24 - 31:28)
you can have a game that just stays (31:27 - 31:30)
exactly the same they keep charging you (31:28 - 31:32)
monthly if you want to be premium and (31:30 - 31:35)
then it eventually just ends u i mean (31:32 - 31:37)
there will be events for sure but yeah (31:35 - 31:40)
but improvements to the processes in the (31:37 - 31:41)
game things like changing the way the (31:40 - 31:43)
randomization work things like changing (31:41 - 31:46)
how frequently you can catch a Pokemon (31:43 - 31:47)
right yeah yeah I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll (31:46 - 31:50)
be able to change (31:47 - 31:53)
that if they want to add everything if (31:50 - 31:56)
so was it select buttons um wanting to (31:53 - 31:58)
or the Pokémon company saying they would (31:56 - 32:00)
want they&#39;d love to get to a point where (31:58 - 32:02)
sleep had every Pokemon in it select (32:00 - 32:04)
button wanted every Pokemon so the (32:02 - 32:06)
Pokemon company wasn&#39;t saying that it (32:04 - 32:08)
was select button saying that yeah they (32:06 - 32:11)
they in the interview it says like our (32:08 - 32:13)
vision was to eventually make the game (32:11 - 32:16)
go until all the Pokemon were added got (32:13 - 32:18)
it and they said there was 125 or not (32:16 - 32:22)
100 1,25 right yeah think could just do (32:18 - 32:24)
a surprise drop every Pokemon is now in (32:22 - 32:26)
the cave and you&#39;ll still get B Sprout (32:24 - 32:30)
at master rank six on that no (32:26 - 32:30)
Dr uh yeah (32:33 - 32:40)
I I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll like truly feel (32:36 - 32:44)
when the full merger happens or goes (32:40 - 32:46)
over like I I don&#39;t know if there will (32:44 - 32:47)
be a point where we&#39;ll log in and we&#39;ll (32:46 - 32:49)
be like ah ilka has definitely had their (32:47 - 32:51)
grubby hands on (32:49 - 32:53)
this I will be watching the (32:51 - 32:55)
communication patterns yeah even if I&#39;m (32:53 - 32:58)
not playing the game as much anymore I (32:55 - 33:01)
want to to see how that changes yeah I I (32:58 - 33:04)
don&#39;t see anything like about the game (33:01 - 33:06)
making a whole bunch of whole lot of (33:04 - 33:09)
difference once it switches over uh (33:06 - 33:10)
because it&#39;s already built how it&#39;s (33:09 - 33:12)
built and if they just keep it how it is (33:10 - 33:14)
and just keep the events going then I (33:12 - 33:15)
feel like you won&#39;t really see much of a (33:14 - 33:18)
difference there yeah but the (33:15 - 33:21)
communication is top tier with select (33:18 - 33:24)
button so it will be interesting to see (33:21 - 33:27)
uh what that how that changes with the (33:24 - 33:30)
switch over (33:27 - 33:30)
uh okay let&#39;s take a quick break and (33:30 - 33:33)
then when we come back we got some (33:32 - 33:36)
smaller Pokemon news and then we will (33:33 - 33:39)
tackle our pocket news so we will be (33:36 - 33:43)
right back and we are back from our (33:39 - 33:46)
break Bobby this is uh your neck of the (33:43 - 33:49)
woods here yeah yeah it is uh we should (33:46 - 33:50)
have probably talked about this last (33:49 - 33:52)
week but last week&#39;s episode was already (33:50 - 33:56)
very long uh this is off pokemon.com get (33:52 - 33:58)

Walk Mall in Anaheim from December 7th (34:13 - 34:18)
through 8th uh that was the first event (34:16 - 34:20)

15th how is that close to you Bobby (34:29 - 34:36)
Broadway Plaza Walnut Creek uh so Walnut (34:32 - 34:39)
Creek is if I&#39;m looking at this (34:36 - 34:41)
correctly it&#39;s a little bit east of (34:39 - 34:45)
Berkeley which is more like uh a little (34:41 - 34:47)
bit more like Northern California well (34:45 - 34:49)
most like Central California I guess (34:47 - 34:52)
technically um so no that&#39;s that&#39;s quite (34:49 - 34:55)
a drive for me if I uh if I really had (34:52 - 34:57)
wanted to uh I could have driven up to (34:55 - 34:59)
Anaheim which is only about 90 minutes (34:57 - 35:01)

York ComicCon which wasn&#39;t affiliated (37:20 - 37:23)
with New York Comic Con but down the (37:22 - 37:25)
street from New York Comic Con which was (37:23 - 37:28)
like first however many people got free (37:25 - 37:30)
gift bags and then you go through the (37:28 - 37:33)
Maze and then but everyone got like a (37:30 - 37:35)

battle kits good luck cuz they are sold (37:50 - 37:55)

moment (37:57 - 38:01)
um but that&#39;s cool if they&#39;re giving (37:58 - 38:03)

also (38:05 - 38:08)
cool I (38:06 - 38:11)
yeah I have (38:08 - 38:16)
a new appreciation of free events like (38:11 - 38:19)
this as somebody who went to go see a (38:16 - 38:22)
holiday light show last night uh it was (38:19 - 38:26)
$38 to drive my car through lights and (38:22 - 38:29)
then there was like it was maybe 10 (38:26 - 38:31)
minutes like it was cool mhm I don&#39;t (38:29 - 38:34)
know $38 cool (38:31 - 38:37)
um but it was about three Christmas (38:34 - 38:38)
songs you know how you like turn your (38:37 - 38:41)
radio to the to the thing so it was (38:38 - 38:44)
about like 10 minutes three songs and (38:41 - 38:46)
then at the end it was like you could (38:44 - 38:49)
rent ice skates and do the skating ring (38:46 - 38:50)
which it was too warm it was like 41 (38:49 - 38:53)
degrees yesterday like well can&#39;t ice (38:50 - 38:55)
skate you get like $4 hot chocolates (38:53 - 38:57)
that are not very good and like sit by (38:55 - 39:00)
this fireplace was like this feels like (38:57 - 39:03)
it should have been free or at least not (39:00 - 39:05)
the business model doesn&#39;t work if that (39:03 - 39:06)
kind of thing was going to be free there (39:05 - 39:10)
would be logos everywhere that&#39;s true (39:06 - 39:12)
yeah sure I mean I&#39;ll take Pikachu I&#39;ll (39:10 - 39:14)
take Pokemon&#39;s logo maybe I&#39;m biased (39:12 - 39:16)
I&#39;ll just take Pokemon&#39;s logo any day (39:14 - 39:18)
you are biased that&#39;s the difference (39:16 - 39:20)
here it&#39;s a giant (39:18 - 39:24)
Pikachu but even even when I was in um (39:20 - 39:26)
when I was in (39:24 - 39:29)
Fukuoka uh they did like the this H what (39:26 - 39:31)
is it like (39:29 - 39:34)
uh where where they had like booths pop (39:31 - 39:35)
up so like some people were selling (39:34 - 39:36)
Christmas ornaments and some people were (39:35 - 39:38)
selling like hot chocolate and there was (39:36 - 39:40)
a bunch of food vendors like a I don&#39;t (39:38 - 39:42)
know what that&#39;s called farmet Farmers (39:40 - 39:45)
Market yeah like a farmer market Winter (39:42 - 39:47)
fair and it was just really cool (39:45 - 39:49)
obviously that&#39;s not it&#39;s free to go to (39:47 - 39:52)
but if you want to buy food obviously um (39:49 - 39:53)
and then the cool thing about Fukuoka at (39:52 - 39:56)
the time is they had like seven of them (39:53 - 39:59)
so if you got hot chocolate at all seven (39:56 - 40:01)
you would get you would complete the (39:59 - 40:03)
collection of like ceramic cups which (40:01 - 40:05)
was like really (40:03 - 40:09)
cool so cute it is really (40:05 - 40:10)
cute (40:09 - 40:14)
uh I don&#39;t know $40 sing Holiday Lights (40:10 - 40:17)
is worth it but I feel like if I was (40:14 - 40:20)
close to this I would be like hey this (40:17 - 40:24)
is a cool thing to do for a couple hours (40:20 - 40:27)
is like drive out there maybe not like a (40:24 - 40:28)
two of it sounds like it&#39;s like two plus (40:27 - 40:31)
hours for you Bobby oh it&#39;s like eight (40:28 - 40:35)
hours for me if I went to the Walnut (40:31 - 40:37)
Creek one yeah yeah again the Anaheim (40:35 - 40:38)
one would have been only like 90 minutes (40:37 - 40:40)
away (40:38 - 40:42)
but yeah no I&#39;m not driving eight hours (40:40 - 40:44)
no one&#39;s driving 8 hours to go get a (40:42 - 40:46)
picture of Pikachu and Eevee and my kid (40:44 - 40:50)
no not well no one in this family no one (40:46 - 40:51)
in this family is because my kids would (40:50 - 40:53)
be like no we&#39;re not sitting in the car (40:51 - 40:56)
for eight hours for that what about 8 (40:53 - 40:58)
hours in the chance of being able to do (40:56 - 41:00)
gmax (40:58 - 41:04)
Lapras the the logic there Bobby is like (41:00 - 41:07)
a bunch of Pokemon fans would be there (41:04 - 41:10)
right and then you&#39;d be able think about (41:07 - 41:12)
it think you just got you gota where (41:10 - 41:15)
would the Pokemon fans be for (41:12 - 41:18)
Lapras I mean as we are recording it is (41:15 - 41:21)
at the closer one today until 8:00 p.m. (41:18 - 41:25)
true until 800 p.m. I can&#39;t I I I (41:21 - 41:27)
already have plans for today I cannot (41:25 - 41:29)
drive to Anaheim I&#39;m not driving to (41:27 - 41:30)
Anaheim for a picture of Pikachu you got (41:29 - 41:31)

know if it&#39;s like most popular because (41:55 - 41:59)
they were vied so well or may be most (41:57 - 42:00)
popular because they sold or they&#39;re (41:59 - 42:02)
just lying to us and this is what they (42:00 - 42:05)
want to sell for the holiday any of (42:02 - 42:07)
those options could be (42:05 - 42:12)
true uh so they&#39;re saying the uh 31 inch (42:07 - 42:13)
Psyduck poke (42:12 - 42:17)
plush that is the like what 300 giant (42:13 - 42:21)
Psyduck yeah like the $300 $400 one yep (42:17 - 42:23)
I would imagine that if you&#39;re spending (42:21 - 42:25)
that much money you&#39;re probably (42:23 - 42:27)
reviewing it you&#39;re probably very happy (42:25 - 42:30)
with the amount of money you spent maybe (42:27 - 42:33)
maybe you expected higher quality and (42:30 - 42:35)
you know maybe the quality is just (42:33 - 42:36)
topnotch (42:35 - 42:40)
and those big plushes usually have GNA (42:36 - 42:43)
say you have at least one of those I (42:40 - 42:46)
have the big Meowth the big Meowth yeah (42:43 - 42:49)
and it&#39;s stuffed under the footboard of (42:46 - 42:51)
my bed he&#39;s like peeking out because I (42:49 - 42:54)
don&#39;t know where else to put him yeah (42:51 - 42:56)
yeah makes (42:54 - 43:00)
sense uh the looming shadow figure by (42:56 - 43:03)
first for four which is the Gengar (43:00 - 43:07)
Gastly Haunter um the Pokemon company (43:03 - 43:10)
sent me some of these first buy four (43:07 - 43:12)
figures they&#39;re very expensive they&#39;re (43:10 - 43:14)
like 250 I (43:12 - 43:17)
think uh they are super nice quality I&#39;m (43:14 - 43:19)
not like they light up in a really nice (43:17 - 43:22)
way that was better than I expected (43:19 - 43:25)
mm I&#39;m not like a figure (43:22 - 43:28)
person at like they&#39;re cool I don&#39;t (43:25 - 43:30)
think I would go out and like buy them (43:28 - 43:33)
on my own I know like figures are (43:30 - 43:35)
probably very popular with our listeners (43:33 - 43:37)
cuz we got a bunch of nerds listening so (43:35 - 43:39)
they&#39;re all like anime fans and Pokemon (43:37 - 43:41)
fans and video game fans and like that&#39;s (43:39 - 43:43)
a big thing in those communities is like (43:41 - 43:47)
it can be real cool yeah yeah yeah (43:43 - 43:51)
yeah would I pay 250 myself personally (43:47 - 43:53)
no but I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s not (43:51 - 43:55)
good quality like they&#39;re they&#39;re very (43:53 - 43:58)
nice they there&#39;s they&#39;re very nice so (43:55 - 44:02)
if there was a karant one yeah (43:58 - 44:03)
okay this is (44:02 - 44:06)
like yeah when it&#39;s your favorite (44:03 - 44:08)
Pokemon yeah lot Gengar fans out there (44:06 - 44:12)
so yeah there are uh the Pokemon soda (44:08 - 44:17)
pop plushes are on here those are cute (44:12 - 44:19)
they are very very good (44:17 - 44:23)
yeah yep the Pokemon TCG scorching (44:19 - 44:26)
Charizard premium playmat I don&#39;t know (44:23 - 44:28)
what makes this playmat premium than (44:26 - 44:31)
their other play mats I don&#39;t either it (44:28 - 44:34)
looks really cool though I like the the (44:31 - 44:37)
colors the orange and black is really (44:34 - 44:38)
cool (44:37 - 44:41)
yeah I think it it&#39;s mostly just the (44:38 - 44:43)
style of it that makes it (44:41 - 44:46)
premium that it looks fancier than a lot (44:43 - 44:49)
of others I think well Andrew Andrew O (44:46 - 44:51)
says amazing product incredible quality (44:49 - 44:55)
would definitely buy again um I think I (44:51 - 44:57)
think if you look at their playmats they (44:55 - 44:58)
all they call all of their playmats (44:57 - 44:59)
premium (44:58 - 45:03)
playmats yeah that&#39;s not surprising so (44:59 - 45:05)
as somebody who has a lot of Pokemon (45:03 - 45:07)
playmats I don&#39;t think they&#39;re very (45:05 - 45:11)
premium they&#39;re like fine like I my the (45:07 - 45:14)
ones that I buy are used as like a desk (45:11 - 45:16)
mat under my I&#39;m literally using one (45:14 - 45:17)
under my mouse and keyboard right now (45:16 - 45:20)
that is a Charizard one yeah there are a (45:17 - 45:22)
couple that I&#39;ve wanted but they sell (45:20 - 45:24)
out too quickly MH yeah I just don&#39;t (45:22 - 45:26)
feel like I know their play mats is in (45:24 - 45:30)
like TCG play mats mhm and I haven&#39;t (45:26 - 45:32)
been to like a local tournament in a (45:30 - 45:35)
long time yeah but back back in the day (45:32 - 45:36)
when you went to like a local TCG (45:35 - 45:39)
tournament they would like pack you in (45:36 - 45:41)
like cattle and people&#39;s playmats would (45:39 - 45:44)
be like overlapping because you were (45:41 - 45:46)
just so you were just sitting so close (45:44 - 45:47)
to (45:46 - 45:49)
everyone that&#39;s not to say that the (45:47 - 45:51)
playm shouldn&#39;t be the size it is I get (45:49 - 45:53)
why it&#39;s the size it is but if I was to (45:51 - 45:57)
use it for my desk like I love oversized (45:53 - 45:59)
mats for my like I just I want my (45:57 - 46:01)
keyboard and my mouse and like a little (45:59 - 46:02)
bit more (46:01 - 46:05)
room that&#39;s how it looks best I have (46:02 - 46:07)
that with my with my this one&#39;s smaller (46:05 - 46:09)
the one I&#39;m using right here in in this (46:07 - 46:12)
room but the in my office there the one (46:09 - 46:14)
that I have it&#39;s like the pixel it&#39;s (46:12 - 46:15)
like Pokemon (46:14 - 46:17)
pixel something oh that one sold out (46:15 - 46:18)
that one sold out like instantly that (46:17 - 46:20)
one um I have that and it I have a (46:18 - 46:22)
fullsize keyboard with like the cuz I&#39;m (46:20 - 46:23)
an accountant so I have the number pad (46:22 - 46:27)
on the side of my keyboard and mouse and (46:23 - 46:29)
there&#39;s room on both sides like it does (46:27 - 46:30)
fill that whole area it&#39;s not like (46:29 - 46:32)
filling up like the entire desk like I (46:30 - 46:33)
know what you mean when you like the (46:32 - 46:36)
really oversized like desk mats um but (46:33 - 46:38)
it does cover a lot of space which is (46:36 - 46:41)
nice for that (46:38 - 46:43)
purpose uh and then the last thing they (46:41 - 46:47)
have is the Beast Ball by the wand (46:43 - 46:50)
company um okay here&#39;s my hot take I&#39;ve (46:47 - 46:52)
been saving for the whole episode this (46:50 - 46:55)
is the worst one they&#39;ve released what (46:52 - 46:58)
for what reason it&#39;s plastic (46:55 - 47:00)
oh oh no it&#39;s not metal the the only (46:58 - 47:04)
thing metal on it is the yellow accents (47:00 - 47:09)
oh no that&#39;s not good yeah (47:04 - 47:09)
so what because of the light I I have (47:09 - 47:14)
posted how if you&#39;re watching the the (47:12 - 47:18)
YouTube video I have 15 of them behind (47:14 - 47:23)
me and when I post them on social media (47:18 - 47:25)
whether that&#39;s Instagram or Tik Tok or (47:23 - 47:27)
YouTube there&#39;s all the comments are (47:25 - 47:29)
it&#39;s whatever like I don&#39;t care it (47:27 - 47:31)
doesn&#39;t bother me whatever I like (47:29 - 47:33)
collecting them but it&#39;s always like I (47:31 - 47:34)
can&#39;t believe you spent $100 on a (47:33 - 47:38)
plastic Pokeball right and my response (47:34 - 47:40)
is like well I don&#39;t respond to them but (47:38 - 47:42)
in my head my response is they&#39;re metal (47:40 - 47:44)
they&#39;re a diecast metal now I know (47:42 - 47:47)
nothing about Metal I don&#39;t know if (47:44 - 47:50)
diecast metal is like when you say that (47:47 - 47:53)
it&#39;s like Oh that&#39;s oh that&#39;s oh okay or (47:50 - 47:57)
if it&#39;s like no diecast metal is just (47:53 - 48:00)
yeah like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t full (47:57 - 48:03)
disclosure I don&#39;t know anything about (48:00 - 48:03)
Metal (48:04 - 48:09)
but they they&#39;re advertised as metal (48:06 - 48:11)
they feel premium when you Hannah you (48:09 - 48:14)
you held one recently yeah yeah I got to (48:11 - 48:16)
hold a full size one recently does it (48:14 - 48:19)
feel like plastic where you at least (48:16 - 48:20)
give me your thought not feel like (48:19 - 48:23)
plastic my first reaction was that it is (48:20 - 48:25)
nowhere near as heavy as you have been (48:23 - 48:28)
implying for these years that they have (48:25 - 48:30)
been coming out you are probably just (48:28 - 48:34)
stronger than me and so it (48:30 - 48:37)
doesn&#39;t I I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as he you (48:34 - 48:40)
keep comparing it to a pool ball I don&#39;t (48:37 - 48:42)
think it&#39;s as heavy as a pool ball I (48:40 - 48:44)
picked it up immediately went oh this is (48:42 - 48:47)
way lighter than I expected (48:44 - 48:51)
and 20 years ago I think so I for (48:47 - 48:53)
context I have the mini one I have the (48:51 - 48:57)
mini Pokeball it is weighted it is also (48:53 - 49:00)
metal so it it feels like metal it feels (48:57 - 49:02)
nice it is weighted there&#39;s a little bit (49:00 - 49:04)
of a plastic feeling because it&#39;s (49:02 - 49:06)
connected with plastic the top and (49:04 - 49:08)
bottom part so you can kind of squeeze (49:06 - 49:11)
it and you can feel that it&#39;s it&#39;s not (49:08 - 49:14)
solid oh yeah the seam is plastic but (49:11 - 49:16)
but it is weighted like it is heavier (49:14 - 49:19)
than a item this size you would expect (49:16 - 49:23)
to to be is it as heavy as a qall (49:19 - 49:26)
or no and so knowing how heavy this one (49:23 - 49:28)
was and not having held one of the (49:26 - 49:31)
fullsize ones before when I picked up (49:28 - 49:33)
the full-size one I was expecting it to (49:31 - 49:36)
be actually weighted and heavy but I (49:33 - 49:37)
don&#39;t think that I would describe it (49:36 - 49:39)
that way I think I would just describe (49:37 - 49:40)
it as (49:39 - 49:43)
metal I wouldn&#39;t describe it as weighted (49:40 - 49:45)
so it&#39;s it&#39;s heavier than a plastic one (49:43 - 49:47)
would be and it doesn&#39;t feel like (49:45 - 49:49)
plastic it feels premium it&#39;s a really (49:47 - 49:52)
cool item I would probably have a (49:49 - 49:54)
collection of them if I could of my (49:52 - 49:58)
favorite ones at least um but it&#39;s not (49:54 - 50:01)
heavy it&#39;s not as heavy as you&#39;ve been (49:58 - 50:02)
saying for these years (50:01 - 50:06)
Steve I am confident that you have more (50:02 - 50:09)
muscle on your body than I do is uh (50:06 - 50:11)
that&#39;s probably correct is the Beast (50:09 - 50:15)
ball then lighter than the other ones if (50:11 - 50:16)
you&#39;re holding both of them in your (50:15 - 50:17)
hands like is the Beast ball (50:16 - 50:19)
considerably lighter since it&#39;s plastic (50:17 - 50:21)
and not metal (50:19 - 50:25)
um there is changes and also the Beast (50:21 - 50:29)
ball is $20 more mhm CU it lights up the (50:25 - 50:31)
whole thing lights up yeah right which (50:29 - 50:33)
is why I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s plastic so that (50:31 - 50:35)
the lights can go can shine through it (50:33 - 50:36)
in a way that the metal probably (50:35 - 50:38)
couldn&#39;t yeah it would be a much more (50:36 - 50:41)
complicated process to put it together (50:38 - 50:43)
if it was metal be like a $200 Beast (50:41 - 50:46)
ball maybe 250 lit up metal oh it (50:43 - 50:50)
doesn&#39;t even look good just on on the (50:46 - 50:53)
video my gosh oh luxury ball looks so (50:50 - 50:54)
good though yeah because the metal won&#39;t (50:53 - 50:56)
reflect because because they are metal (50:54 - 50:58)
and are reflective especially you&#39;re (50:56 - 51:00)
comparing it to the luxury ball which is (50:58 - 51:03)
the best looking one of all of them oh (51:00 - 51:08)
yeah that&#39;s the Beast ball is so bad (51:03 - 51:11)
it&#39;s gosh I maybe I&#39;m just so weak I do (51:08 - 51:14)
feel like this is very heavy (51:11 - 51:17)
uh so yeah (51:14 - 51:17)
so can you hear that uh-huh like all I&#39;m (51:18 - 51:23)
doing is I&#39;m putting pressure on it and (51:22 - 51:25)
you can hear the plastic (51:23 - 51:29)
crack nothing on the luxury ball this is (51:25 - 51:30)
this is very bad (51:29 - 51:36)
audio um mine does a little click so the (51:30 - 51:39)
yeah the yellow I don&#39;t know what these (51:36 - 51:41)
are called for the audio listeners if (51:39 - 51:43)
beastball has like four yellow arcs (51:41 - 51:47)
around it um those are metal for sure (51:43 - 51:50)
but the anything blue is plastic weird (51:47 - 51:54)
and for the um all the other Pokéballs (51:50 - 51:58)
oh this is Dusty you can push the center (51:54 - 52:02)
and then the the battery which is (51:58 - 52:04)
actually I thought the battery would (52:02 - 52:06)
weigh more but no this is pretty hefty (52:04 - 52:08)
uh so that that pops out right so you (52:06 - 52:10)
can replace the battery not expect that (52:08 - 52:13)
to happen at all yeah is that how real (52:10 - 52:14)
pokeballs happen in the PO in the (52:13 - 52:17)
Pokemon Universe yeah it&#39;s uh so I get (52:14 - 52:19)
two comments on all these videos one is (52:17 - 52:21)
people being like that&#39;s what I can&#39;t (52:19 - 52:23)
believe you paid $100 for a plastic (52:21 - 52:25)
Pokeball again I don&#39;t know the quality (52:23 - 52:27)
of die cast metal that&#39;s just what they (52:25 - 52:30)
say um but diecast is just how it&#39;s (52:27 - 52:34)
shaped oh okay they are metal cool and (52:30 - 52:38)
uh so the the Beast ball this does not (52:34 - 52:39)
push open at all it&#39;s the only one out (52:38 - 52:41)
of the 15 where the center doesn&#39;t push (52:39 - 52:45)
open there&#39;s actually uh silicone on the (52:41 - 52:49)
very back and if you peel it open (52:45 - 52:51)
there&#39;s a (52:49 - 52:55)
USBC port and so you can charge it that (52:51 - 52:57)
way but from my understanding (52:55 - 53:00)
as plasticky as this ball is also I&#39;m (52:57 - 53:01)
like actually shifting this entire (53:00 - 53:06)
bracket here oh no this is just me like (53:01 - 53:09)
the whole thing it lights up right yeah (53:06 - 53:10)
but there&#39;s no way to take the battery (53:09 - 53:13)
out that I know of that feels like (53:10 - 53:17)
something I would buy for $30 at Target (53:13 - 53:21)
so again I I I several several hundred (53:17 - 53:23)
comments of how this is a plastic (53:21 - 53:26)
Pokeball and how could I pay $100 for (53:23 - 53:27)
that which which (53:26 - 53:30)
not I&#39;m not justifying the price like (53:27 - 53:31)
I&#39;m not sure they were they are worth (53:30 - 53:33)
$100 to begin with but at least the (53:31 - 53:35)
metal makes them feel like it what are (53:33 - 53:37)
you about to like say here you&#39;re like (53:35 - 53:40)
no I paid $120 for the plastic right (53:37 - 53:44)
what but what I am saying is this one is (53:40 - 53:48)
$120 and that is why I feel like it&#39;s (53:44 - 53:51)
the worst one yeah because even though (53:48 - 53:54)
it the whole thing lights up it is (53:51 - 53:57)
actually plastic those those comments (53:54 - 53:59)
are correct this is a plastic ball that (53:57 - 54:02)
I paid $120 for with no way to take the (53:59 - 54:06)
battery out I do kind of like the USBC (54:02 - 54:08)
on the back I don&#39;t really like the (54:06 - 54:10)
silicone thing on the back to like hide (54:08 - 54:12)
it because you kind of just like peel it (54:10 - 54:13)
there&#39;s no way to like actually open it (54:12 - 54:16)
it&#39;s just kind of like yeah peeling it (54:13 - 54:18)
and then you heard (54:16 - 54:21)
how yeah the plasticky sounds and you (54:18 - 54:23)
just being able to move parts of it (54:21 - 54:26)
around just it really does I feel I&#39;m (54:23 - 54:27)
going to break it (54:26 - 54:29)
yeah if Hannah was holding this right (54:27 - 54:31)
now it would be shattered because of her (54:29 - 54:34)
muscles it feels like a kids&#39;s toy that (54:31 - 54:36)
you would get from Target that&#39;s at (54:34 - 54:38)
least the sounds of it I really don&#39;t (54:36 - 54:40)
like that I know that&#39;s a that&#39;s a (54:38 - 54:42)
bummer because I know that they&#39;re only (54:40 - 54:44)
they&#39;re only three of them that are 120 (54:42 - 54:46)
instead of 100 right so I think the (54:44 - 54:49)
master ball the luxury ball and the (54:46 - 54:53)
Beast ball were all 120 instead of 100 (54:49 - 54:55)
and I know the master ball I&#39;m assuming (54:53 - 54:57)
is also metal for sure right and then (54:55 - 55:00)
the nice yeah so yeah that&#39;s a bummer (54:57 - 55:02)
that they did that (55:00 - 55:05)
especially the very top of their Pokemon (55:02 - 55:09)
Center 2024 awards show post well I I (55:05 - 55:12)
mean I think people just like the having (55:09 - 55:14)
the beastball it looks cool in the (55:12 - 55:15)
product (55:14 - 55:19)
photos yeah I again because the first 14 (55:15 - 55:21)
were (55:19 - 55:25)
metal I expected this to be metal MH (55:21 - 55:28)
yeah yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s not I think (55:25 - 55:31)
Eduardo is wrong here love the beastball (55:28 - 55:32)
in my opinion it&#39;s the best Pokeball out (55:31 - 55:34)
of all of them the lighting is amazing (55:32 - 55:36)
the display next to the other pokeballs (55:34 - 55:38)
is amazing my favorite so far I disagree (55:36 - 55:41)
Eduardo I do I it&#39;s too plasticky it&#39;s (55:38 - 55:43)
it&#39;s $20 more expensive there&#39;s no way (55:41 - 55:46)
to take the battery out I feel like I&#39;m (55:43 - 55:49)
actually going to like crush (55:46 - 55:52)
it with my weak (55:49 - 55:57)
arms yeah um and look again it does look (55:52 - 56:01)
cool it looks nice and sitting up from I (55:57 - 56:03)
don&#39;t know from a distance on my shelf (56:01 - 56:05)
from a distance it does look exactly (56:03 - 56:09)
like all of them yeah and it&#39;s a beast (56:05 - 56:11)
ball people love the beastball but that (56:09 - 56:12)
is unfortunate that it&#39;s not the same (56:11 - 56:15)
quality as the I mean I would have even (56:12 - 56:17)
I&#39;d have been okay with just don&#39;t have (56:15 - 56:19)
the whole thing light up make it metal (56:17 - 56:21)
cuz I it&#39;s got to be the lighting up the (56:19 - 56:22)
whole thing that made they had to do (56:21 - 56:25)
plastic instead yeah to keep that price (56:22 - 56:28)
down so just don&#39;t have it light up make (56:25 - 56:31)
it metal redo it redo it Pokemon or one (56:28 - 56:35)
[Laughter] (56:31 - 56:37)
company yeah I don&#39;t know how many balls (56:35 - 56:39)
they would have left Safari Ball (56:37 - 56:43)
moonball speed dream ball or sportball (56:39 - 56:46)
sport ball dive ball is already there (56:43 - 56:48)
netball is already there like the (56:46 - 56:51)
Legends archus pokeballs oh jeez yeah (56:48 - 56:54)
the net ball is the metal but the like (56:51 - 56:56)
netting on the net ball is like plastic (56:54 - 56:59)
no really it I thought it was all metal (56:56 - 57:02)
when I looked at that like that&#39;s a (56:59 - 57:04)
bummer (57:02 - 57:06)
too not as much of a bummer as the (57:04 - 57:09)
beastball yeah I got I got Sun cost (57:06 - 57:12)
fallacy on these pokeballs I got this is (57:09 - 57:14)
the reason I never bought one was (57:12 - 57:16)
because I would then have to buy all of (57:14 - 57:18)
them like in my head I&#39;d be like well (57:16 - 57:19)
now I have to collect them all and so I (57:18 - 57:21)
was like I&#39;m not going to buy one so (57:19 - 57:23)
that I don&#39;t have to buy them all yeah I (57:21 - 57:25)
am really limiting myself with the mini (57:23 - 57:28)
ones making sure I don&#39;t do that the the (57:25 - 57:30)
the Beast ball has really broke me the (57:28 - 57:32)
Beast ball is my Pokemon sleep of the (57:30 - 57:34)

pocket going forward now then today we (60:10 - 60:15)
would like to announce a new con content (60:13 - 60:17)

major update to begin we plan on adding (60:17 - 60:22)
new booster packs by the end of the (60:20 - 60:24)
year they&#39;re running out of time it&#39;s (60:22 - 60:26)
December 8th when we&#39;re recording this (60:24 - 60:27)
in addition we are aiming to add a (60:26 - 60:29)
feature that will allow certain cards to (60:27 - 60:33)
be traded starting in January of 2025 we (60:29 - 60:34)
are planning to gradually expand the (60:33 - 60:36)
selection of cards that will also be (60:34 - 60:38)
traded there&#39;s no way they&#39;re going to (60:36 - 60:40)
allow for gold trading cards there&#39;s (60:38 - 60:43)
just there ain&#39;t no way right they&#39;re (60:40 - 60:45)
saying certain cards yeah the way (60:43 - 60:47)
they&#39;re saying certain cards probably (60:45 - 60:49)
not and that makes me kind of nervous (60:47 - 60:51)
after so many years of Pokemon go and (60:49 - 60:55)
drip beaing I guess okay we can talk (60:51 - 60:58)
about this uh also we have new features (60:55 - 61:00)

continue to enjoy Pokemon trading guard (61:10 - 61:14)
pocket don&#39;t forget to open your packs (61:12 - 61:17)
each day the operations (61:14 - 61:20)
team uh so real quick on the trading (61:17 - 61:22)
thing thing that&#39;s interesting is let&#39;s (61:20 - 61:23)
say they don&#39;t allow you to trade gold (61:22 - 61:25)
cards (61:23 - 61:27)
right I guess my thing is like what&#39;s (61:25 - 61:31)
the purpose there because if it&#39;s for (61:27 - 61:34)
they don&#39;t want people to collect them (61:31 - 61:36)
like be able to collect them without (61:34 - 61:38)
opening them then I understand as far as (61:36 - 61:40)
like battling doesn&#39;t really make a (61:38 - 61:43)
difference because a gold Mewtwo EX is (61:40 - 61:45)
the same as a regular Mewtwo EX the (61:43 - 61:47)
mechanics are the same right so you (61:45 - 61:49)
don&#39;t need to have a gold one you can (61:47 - 61:51)
just trade (61:49 - 61:54)
for I know that there are people out (61:51 - 61:57)
there that have like 30 counts oh for (61:54 - 62:01)
sure mhm and if they can open 60 booster (61:57 - 62:03)
packs a day for free instead of two (62:01 - 62:04)
booster packs a day for (62:03 - 62:06)
free then they don&#39;t have to give the (62:04 - 62:10)
game any money and then they can trade (62:06 - 62:15)
what they&#39;re missing sure I yeah yeah I (62:10 - 62:18)
understand that I so one thing that&#39;s (62:15 - 62:20)
been floating around as like a theory of (62:18 - 62:24)
how they would do this is similar to uh (62:20 - 62:27)
crushing a card for obtaining play like (62:24 - 62:30)
you have to have three of them in your (62:27 - 62:32)
in your collection in order to trade one (62:30 - 62:35)
yeah so I think that&#39;s not that again (62:32 - 62:38)
this is just a like Theory this is not (62:35 - 62:39)
like there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s been said (62:38 - 62:41)
about this officially but if they did (62:39 - 62:43)
that that whole thing of having 30 (62:41 - 62:45)
accounts would be a lot harder because (62:43 - 62:49)
you&#39;d still have to pull three of that (62:45 - 62:51)
super rare card before you able to trade (62:49 - 62:53)
one off to one of your other (62:51 - 62:56)
accounts harder but unless you&#39;re Hannah (62:53 - 62:58)
who pulls gold Mewtwo like left still (62:56 - 63:01)
hav&#39;t gotten the third one yet you know (62:58 - 63:03)
I did one I did pull one so I was (63:01 - 63:06)
excited about that good someone in the (63:03 - 63:08)
comments last time did tell me that I (63:06 - 63:10)
can pull a gold Mewtwo from any of the (63:08 - 63:12)
kinds of packs that I hadn&#39;t realized (63:10 - 63:14)
that before so now I can open packs that (63:12 - 63:16)
aren&#39;t just Mewtwo packs right yes (63:14 - 63:18)
because the the immersive cards are (63:16 - 63:21)
limited to their packs but the gold are (63:18 - 63:23)
not okay I still haven&#39;t gotten the (63:21 - 63:25)
immersive Mewtwo though so for now still (63:23 - 63:28)
stick with the Mewtwo packs same yeah (63:25 - 63:30)
Steve over here with like 17 immersive (63:28 - 63:34)
Mewtwo ah I think I have three okay but (63:30 - 63:36)
no gold No Gold (63:34 - 63:39)
Anything and I&#39;m missing like literally (63:36 - 63:41)
missing like Victory Bell and vile plume (63:39 - 63:44)
to get me and they&#39;re not even like (63:41 - 63:46)
those aren&#39;t even like rare they&#39;re rare (63:44 - 63:49)
but they&#39;re not you just pack sounds I&#39;m (63:46 - 63:52)
not pack pointing a victory bell Bobby I (63:49 - 63:54)
pack pointed a couple to get my I pack (63:52 - 63:57)
pointed a couple to get my me uh I&#39;m (63:54 - 63:59)
three away from completing the set not (63:57 - 64:01)
including secret rares but from (63:59 - 64:04)
completing the 226 I&#39;m three away from (64:01 - 64:06)
that so and they&#39;re all EX cards so I (64:04 - 64:08)
can&#39;t pack one we had a a conversation (64:06 - 64:11)
in slack because the last week we talked (64:08 - 64:14)
about how somebody spent (64:11 - 64:16)
$1,500 I&#39;m not going to name any names (64:14 - 64:19)
in slack if you want to sign up for $5 a (64:16 - 64:21)
month you can go on our slack and see (64:19 - 64:23)
who said this anyway somebody was like I (64:21 - 64:24)
didn&#39;t spend any money or maybe they (64:23 - 64:27)
said they spent like $75 or something (64:24 - 64:28)
and they were like I&#39;m only like four (64:27 - 64:31)
cards away yeah uh the (64:28 - 64:33)
226 I&#39;m not I&#39;m not bringing this up to (64:31 - 64:35)
call this person I&#39;m bringing this up to (64:33 - 64:37)
be like to let people know to inform (64:35 - 64:40)
people the 226 isn&#39;t the actual card (64:37 - 64:44)
count correct um how does this Bobby you (64:40 - 64:45)
want to explain how this works because (64:44 - 64:47)
it&#39;s the same thing in the real TCG yeah (64:45 - 64:49)
it works in the real TCG this way as (64:47 - 64:51)
well so it little different so in the in (64:49 - 64:54)
the the real TCG in the the PO the (64:51 - 64:57)
physical TCG the physical game yeah not (64:54 - 65:00)
yeah so in the physical TCG let&#39;s say (64:57 - 65:04)
the the set has like it says 180 cards (65:00 - 65:06)
on the bottom corner of the card bottom (65:04 - 65:07)
right corner it actually gives you a (65:06 - 65:10)
number out of 180 so if you go through (65:07 - 65:12)
the set you have one out of 180 all the (65:10 - 65:15)
way through 180 out of 180 then you have (65:12 - 65:17)
the secret rares the secret rares are (65:15 - 65:19)
called secret rares because they are (65:17 - 65:21)
above that number so then you actually (65:19 - 65:27)
see a card and it&#39;s number 181 out of 18 (65:21 - 65:31)
so the like regular set is 180 cards and (65:27 - 65:33)
then there will be like 50 secret rares (65:31 - 65:36)
so to actually complete the entire set (65:33 - 65:39)
you&#39;re collecting 230 cards but to (65:36 - 65:40)
collect (65:39 - 65:43)
the regular set I guess you would call (65:40 - 65:46)
it then that&#39;s just the initial 180 (65:43 - 65:48)
that&#39;s numbered so same thing happens in (65:46 - 65:52)
Pocket there are cards that are 226 226 (65:48 - 65:54)
and then you have everything that I (65:52 - 65:57)
believe is two two star and up is (65:54 - 66:00)
considered a secret rare in pocket so (65:57 - 66:03)
all the two star three star and gold (66:00 - 66:06)
crown cards are secret rares and they (66:03 - 66:09)
will be a number that&#39;s above 226 and I (66:06 - 66:10)
think somebody else in slack said there (66:09 - 66:14)
are 58 secret (66:10 - 66:17)
rares thought it was 60 because there&#39;s (66:14 - 66:21)
286 cards total oh okay yeah 60 the gold (66:17 - 66:25)
Mewtwo is 286 out of 226 essentially (66:21 - 66:31)
okay yeah so so 226 Bas 60 secret so (66:25 - 66:33)
people will look at that b again not (66:31 - 66:35)
there no Shay to anyone I also for the (66:33 - 66:37)
first like week of the game was like oh (66:35 - 66:39)
I made a huge dent in the (66:37 - 66:44)
226 uh the 226 is incredibly deceiving (66:39 - 66:46)
and I&#39;ve seen this on I&#39;ve seen this on (66:44 - 66:47)
Twitter I&#39;ve seen this in our YouTube (66:46 - 66:48)
comments I&#39;ve seen this on Reddit where (66:47 - 66:50)
people see or hear these articles of (66:48 - 66:54)
somebody spending $700 or $1,000 in the (66:50 - 66:56)
game and they go well I&#39;ve spent no (66:54 - 66:58)
money and I&#39;m only six away no you are (66:56 - 67:03)
six away from completing the base set it (66:58 - 67:05)
doesn&#39;t show you how many maybe there&#39;s (67:03 - 67:07)
a toggle I haven&#39;t found it that hasn&#39;t (67:05 - 67:12)
shown you like you have 40 of the 60 (67:07 - 67:14)
secret rares I don&#39;t think the game (67:12 - 67:18)
shows you that at all yeah it only shows (67:14 - 67:20)
you the original (67:18 - 67:24)
226 um like if you go into your deck or (67:20 - 67:26)
you go into your cards and you search or (67:24 - 67:28)
you turn on you can you can toggle that (67:26 - 67:30)
thing at the top that shows you which (67:28 - 67:32)
cards you&#39;re missing but it only shows (67:30 - 67:34)
you that for up to the first 226 and (67:32 - 67:35)
then after that it&#39;ll show you all the (67:34 - 67:37)
secret rares you have collected but it (67:35 - 67:38)
won&#39;t show you like all the ones you&#39;re (67:37 - 67:41)
missing in those spots right which I (67:38 - 67:44)
think is just bad like I get that (67:41 - 67:46)
they&#39;re secret rares but like I don&#39;t (67:44 - 67:48)
want to need another resource to like (67:46 - 67:49)
look (67:48 - 67:52)
up what I&#39;m missing yeah even in like (67:49 - 67:54)
even in the in the physical TCG like if (67:52 - 67:56)
you buy an elite trainer box and you get (67:54 - 67:57)
the little booklet that shows you all (67:56 - 67:59)
the cards it shows you all the secret (67:57 - 68:01)
rares as well like it&#39;ll show you that (67:59 - 68:02)
you know so it&#39;s like and underneath (68:01 - 68:04)
those pictures it has like the number (68:02 - 68:07)
right yep yeah yep exactly so you know (68:04 - 68:11)
that they&#39;re secret rares feel like I (68:07 - 68:12)
remember someone mentioning that there (68:11 - 68:14)
was a setting and now I&#39;m trying to find (68:12 - 68:17)
it there is a setting there is a setting (68:14 - 68:20)
when you go to search so if you actually (68:17 - 68:21)
click on the little magnifying glass to (68:20 - 68:24)
search you can at the bottom there&#39;s a (68:21 - 68:26)
setting that says card decks View (68:24 - 68:29)
options mhm um and then it says you can (68:26 - 68:31)
it says by default some unknown cards (68:29 - 68:33)
are hidden in the card decks view toggle (68:31 - 68:35)
on the settings below to temporarily (68:33 - 68:37)
display unknowned unowned cards in those (68:35 - 68:39)
categories and that&#39;s cards with a (68:37 - 68:41)
rarity of one star or greater so I think (68:39 - 68:45)
if you turn those on and hit okay and (68:41 - 68:48)
scroll down yeah okay so if you turn (68:45 - 68:49)
that you have to hit the you have to hit (68:48 - 68:51)
the toggle first and then hit the (68:49 - 68:53)
magnifying glass hit the toggle (68:51 - 68:55)
magnifying glass and then hit the toggle (68:53 - 68:56)
in the magnifying glass (68:55 - 68:58)
that&#39;s ridiculous and you can see oh and (68:56 - 69:01)
then it works okay I see I see I see (68:58 - 69:04)
okay cuz yeah I see the 286 would be the (69:01 - 69:07)
gold meww because I think the immersive (69:04 - 69:11)
Mew was 283 yep um there we (69:07 - 69:15)
go yeah I&#39;m missing a huge chunk (69:11 - 69:15)
of Yeah the secret rares but again it (69:16 - 69:22)
doesn&#39;t update the number it so mine (69:20 - 69:25)
says 212 out of 226 yeah so I could so I (69:22 - 69:26)
could (69:25 - 69:29)
I could be like I&#39;m only 14 cards away (69:26 - 69:31)
but then I&#39;m like I don&#39;t have any of (69:29 - 69:33)
the gold cards I don&#39;t have Mew I don&#39;t (69:31 - 69:38)
have like 20 some secret rares yeah so I (69:33 - 69:39)
was actually wrong the secret rares (69:38 - 69:43)
start with the one star cards not the (69:39 - 69:45)
two star so every one star and above is (69:43 - 69:49)
a secret rare one if you go to the top (69:45 - 69:51)
of your yeah the one star gold cards if (69:49 - 69:52)
you go to the top of your thing where it (69:51 - 69:54)
shows you 220 or mine says 223 out of (69:52 - 69:57)
226 it shows the little away Bobby (69:54 - 69:59)
you&#39;re threeway I know I&#39;m threeway it (69:57 - 70:01)
shows the little Diamond to the left so (69:59 - 70:03)
that&#39;s showing me like everything that (70:01 - 70:05)
is a one through four Diamond I have 223 (70:03 - 70:08)
out of the 226 and then it&#39;s telling me (70:05 - 70:09)
I have (70:08 - 70:11)
23 secret rares like it tells you it (70:09 - 70:13)
shows a little star next to the number (70:11 - 70:15)
the oh that&#39;s what the star is okay so I (70:13 - 70:18)
have 29 secret Wares right so then and (70:15 - 70:20)
then there&#39;s a little Crown next to that (70:18 - 70:23)
and it shows for me like one cuz I have (70:20 - 70:25)
one of the I have crown I don&#39;t even (70:23 - 70:28)
have a yeah I have no Crown at all (70:25 - 70:32)
sad no no crown for (70:28 - 70:34)
Steve yeah so but it doesn&#39;t tell you (70:32 - 70:36)
that is interesting it doesn&#39;t tell you (70:34 - 70:38)
how many secret rares there (70:36 - 70:42)
are right whereas like the diamond it (70:38 - 70:44)
shows 223 out of (70:42 - 70:46)
226 the star just shows me the number I (70:44 - 70:48)
have and the crown just shows me the (70:46 - 70:49)
number I have it doesn&#39;t say like out of (70:48 - 70:51)
how many but you can go manually count (70:49 - 70:54)
them if you have it yeah you can scroll (70:51 - 70:55)
and you can see the ones you&#39;re missing (70:54 - 70:57)
but it is absolutely ridiculous how (70:55 - 71:00)
hidden that setting is yeah you have (70:57 - 71:04)
toggle magnifying glass scroll down (71:00 - 71:07)
toggle uh they&#39;re (71:04 - 71:12)
secret secret oh that makes (71:07 - 71:12)
sense uh speaking of collecting all the (71:12 - 71:17)
cards uh this is off cbr.com this is (71:15 - 71:20)
published three days ago according to (71:17 - 71:22)
pocketgamer.biz the virtual card (71:20 - 71:24)
collecting mobile game has been a hit (71:22 - 71:27)
among Pokemon players the TCG pocket (71:24 - 71:31)
hitting an estimated uh $28 million of (71:27 - 71:35)
gross revenue as of November 29th these (71:31 - 71:38)
things are figured based on app magic (71:35 - 71:40)
estimates uh (71:38 - 71:43)
which if we scroll (71:40 - 71:46)
down uh it says the mobile games best (71:43 - 71:48)
single day aligned with the fire Pokemon (71:46 - 71:52)
Mass outbreak event which was $8.4 (71:48 - 71:55)
Million on November 22nd is that just (71:52 - 71:56)
when they did the the Arcanine stuff (71:55 - 71:58)
yeah that&#39;s the Arcanine why did they (71:56 - 72:01)
use the word surprised by that they call (71:58 - 72:03)
using those an outbreak event yeah oh (72:01 - 72:05)
they&#39;ve been causing them calling them (72:03 - 72:06)
outbreaks yeah that that&#39;s what they (72:05 - 72:09)
called the Arcanine one the fire one (72:06 - 72:12)
interesting I guess I missed that (72:09 - 72:15)
term uh during this limited time event (72:12 - 72:17)
Pokemon TCG Pockets players pocket (72:15 - 72:18)
players received a free bonus poll (72:17 - 72:20)
guaranteeing fire Tye (72:18 - 72:22)
Pokemon (72:20 - 72:25)
um they also said that Pokemon go (72:22 - 72:28)
generated over 8 billion since its (72:25 - 72:30)
launch in in (72:28 - 72:34)
2016 pocket gross Pockets gross revenue (72:30 - 72:36)
has already passed other Pokemon mobile (72:34 - 72:39)
games two uh 2023 Pokemon sleep is at (72:36 - 72:43)
120 million to this day just to remind (72:39 - 72:45)
you they are saying 208 million for (72:43 - 72:47)
pocket and it has not even been out for (72:45 - 72:50)
two months it&#39;s already past (72:47 - 72:53)
sleep uh Pokemon unite which came out in (72:50 - 72:57)
2021 has only made 82 2.7 million also (72:53 - 72:59)
that should be news in itself that (72:57 - 73:01)
Pokemon sleeve has made more money than (72:59 - 73:04)
Pokemon unite that is yeah kind of crazy (73:01 - 73:06)
that&#39;s (73:04 - 73:06)
ridiculous uh and then Pokemon go the (73:07 - 73:11)
only other Pokemon game that has made (73:09 - 73:14)
more money than TCG pocket and then uh (73:11 - 73:16)
the only other game that has made more (73:14 - 73:18)
money to TC than TCG pocket currently is (73:16 - 73:22)
Pokemon Masters ex which came out in (73:18 - 73:27)
2019 and that has made 300 million so (73:22 - 73:29)
I&#39;m in lifetime Revenue so is going to (73:27 - 73:33)
surpass it in the next month or two yes (73:29 - 73:36)
yeah and another thing I I noticed that (73:33 - 73:38)
Vincent pointed out in the slack was (73:36 - 73:40)
that um Marvel snap&#39;s lifetime revenue (73:38 - 73:44)
is at 275 million so pocket is actually (73:40 - 73:47)
really close to surpassing snap already (73:44 - 73:51)
take that Mickey (73:47 - 73:51)
Mouse actually let me double check when (73:52 - 73:56)
that article was from yeah that was from (73:54 - 73:59)
October of this year so snap is probably (73:56 - 74:00)
a little higher than that at this point (73:59 - 74:03)
but not (74:00 - 74:03)
much (74:03 - 74:10)
WoW pocket is is generating Revenue yeah (74:05 - 74:13)
seriously that&#39;s crazy that is that is (74:10 - 74:16)
wild wait was there well I would really (74:13 - 74:18)
where&#39;s the cafe (74:16 - 74:22)
remix need to (74:18 - 74:22)
they um yeah (74:23 - 74:30)
uh I we&#39;re supposed we&#39;re supposed to (74:27 - 74:32)
get new booster packs by the end of the (74:30 - 74:34)
year I think they were rumored to be hoo (74:32 - 74:36)
and Lugia booster so two booster packs I (74:34 - 74:37)
think hooh was supposed to be on one (74:36 - 74:40)
Lugia was supposed to be on the other um (74:37 - 74:43)
that&#39;s the rumor at (74:40 - 74:46)
least what comes after that I don&#39;t know (74:43 - 74:47)
I don&#39;t even know if they&#39;re (74:46 - 74:50)
considering what comes next like a (74:47 - 74:53)
smaller set or a limited set or like (74:50 - 74:55)
what do they call it in the physical (74:53 - 74:59)
game game Bobby like holiday set (74:55 - 75:04)
usually special set another term but uh (74:59 - 75:08)
I mean $28 million so far they&#39;re (75:04 - 75:09)
definitely (75:08 - 75:13)
considering all kinds of things I&#39;m (75:09 - 75:13)
sure the the the whaling is (75:14 - 75:21)
strong people like buying Pokemon cards (75:18 - 75:23)
people like opening packs of Pokemon (75:21 - 75:26)
cards this is very very (75:23 - 75:28)
mhm they make it very easy to spend (75:26 - 75:31)
money and to rip 10 packs open very (75:28 - 75:35)
quickly yeah they do they (75:31 - 75:39)
do that&#39;s true so yeah it&#39;s continues to (75:35 - 75:41)
be a very fun game and since they just (75:39 - 75:43)
you know I think we talked about it last (75:41 - 75:45)
week but since they just did the new (75:43 - 75:48)
Venusaur event and the new well and then (75:45 - 75:51)
the premium you know renewed for (75:48 - 75:53)
December so they have new stuff there (75:51 - 75:56)
just gets people to jump in and (75:53 - 75:58)
and do more so I think if they can keep (75:56 - 76:00)
these things up I really do think like (75:58 - 76:04)
having a solo event almost like once a (76:00 - 76:05)
month (76:04 - 76:08)
is a really good idea because it&#39;s it&#39;s (76:05 - 76:10)
fun to be able to do these battles and (76:08 - 76:12)
not have to just like worry about (76:10 - 76:14)
battling other people but you get to do (76:12 - 76:15)
the battles against the computer and (76:14 - 76:18)
stuff and I think that&#39;s really fun and (76:15 - 76:20)
I assume that we&#39;ll see another PVP (76:18 - 76:23)
event maybe when like the new these new (76:20 - 76:25)
packs release I could see them doing (76:23 - 76:27)
some kind of mini PVP event with that as (76:25 - 76:33)
well so yeah I (76:27 - 76:33)
I I feel like I&#39;m already bored with the (76:33 - 76:41)
battling and that&#39;s like not a bad I I (76:37 - 76:43)
don&#39;t mean that in like a bad way I but (76:41 - 76:47)
I do mean that in a way of somebody who (76:43 - 76:49)
played the TCG competitively for four (76:47 - 76:51)
almost four years and like went to (76:49 - 76:54)
tournaments every weekend it I&#39;ll just (76:51 - 76:55)
explain it again cuz I know we have new (76:54 - 76:57)
listeners because we started covering (76:55 - 76:58)
pocket and people are excited about (76:57 - 77:01)
pocket um but like in the physical TCG (76:58 - 77:03)
what would happen is a set comes out (77:01 - 77:06)
every three months and so the the first (77:03 - 77:08)
month the set comes out like everyone&#39;s (77:06 - 77:11)
excited everyone&#39;s trying new cards (77:08 - 77:12)
people are trying new decks people are (77:11 - 77:13)
taking new cards and putting them in (77:12 - 77:16)
their old decks and then usually at that (77:13 - 77:18)
point like a local tournament has (77:16 - 77:20)
happened or a regional tournament has (77:18 - 77:23)
happened and some deck whatever deck (77:20 - 77:25)
wins becomes like this state so the (77:23 - 77:28)
second month of that set people are (77:25 - 77:31)
trying to either counter that or (77:28 - 77:33)
solidify like what&#39;s good and then when (77:31 - 77:35)
the third month happens no one is (77:33 - 77:37)
interested anymore everyone&#39;s like we&#39;ve (77:35 - 77:39)
been playing this for two months it&#39;s (77:37 - 77:43)
boring I want new cards and then so the (77:39 - 77:44)
third month everyone&#39;s just waiting for (77:43 - 77:47)
that new set and then the cycle starts (77:44 - 77:50)
over and that is how the TCG has been I (77:47 - 77:52)
left the TCG obviously but that is still (77:50 - 77:55)
exactly how it&#39;s been and I&#39;ve already (77:52 - 77:58)
felt that with pocket and again I don&#39;t (77:55 - 77:59)
think it&#39;s a bad thing I&#39;m not like (77:58 - 78:00)
trying to complain about it or dog on it (77:59 - 78:02)
it&#39;s just that that there&#39;s not as many (78:00 - 78:06)
cards in Pocket as there are in the (78:02 - 78:09)
current TCG because also the current TCG (78:06 - 78:10)
Cycles out cards every two years so you (78:09 - 78:13)
can still use cards from two years ago (78:10 - 78:15)
and you can make more decks and you can (78:13 - 78:19)
be more experimental um I I think that (78:15 - 78:21)
like we already have the established (78:19 - 78:23)
decks right we have we have the Pikachu (78:21 - 78:24)
deck we have the the Charizard deck we (78:23 - 78:26)
have the Mewtwo deck I think those are (78:24 - 78:28)
all considered s tier I don&#39;t know where (78:26 - 78:30)
Charizard came from I think Charizard (78:28 - 78:31)
won a couple tournaments and then people (78:30 - 78:33)
realize that oh actually Charizard is (78:31 - 78:36)
good and it&#39;s made its way into s tier (78:33 - 78:37)
uh and then you have like your a tier (78:36 - 78:39)
decks which is like (78:37 - 78:42)
Articuno um pretty much like every water (78:39 - 78:43)
deck is like a tier and the only reason (78:42 - 78:45)
it&#39;s like not s tier is because like (78:43 - 78:49)
Misty is so unreliable (78:45 - 78:51)
yeah and then you have like I don&#39;t even (78:49 - 78:53)
know if AR like Arbok and weezing is (78:51 - 78:56)
like a tier in my head like B tier like (78:53 - 78:59)
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as good as the other (78:56 - 79:02)
decks um and then there&#39;s like Dragonite (78:59 - 79:03)
and as somebody who built that Dragon (79:02 - 79:04)
Knight deck I don&#39;t know I just don&#39;t (79:03 - 79:06)
think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s really (79:04 - 79:08)
clunky (79:06 - 79:10)
um (79:08 - 79:14)
but I would love more cards like I&#39;m (79:10 - 79:18)
slightly yeah bored but again because we (79:14 - 79:21)
there&#39;s not a lot of cards it&#39;s been two (79:18 - 79:22)
months (79:21 - 79:25)
now um specifically trainer cards cuz (79:22 - 79:27)
cuz like every deck is like two Oak two (79:25 - 79:29)
Pokeball no matter what two sub almost (79:27 - 79:30)
like I&#39;m pretty sure every deck is like (79:29 - 79:32)
two Sabrina no matter what two so like (79:30 - 79:35)
six of your 20 cards are the same yep (79:32 - 79:38)
that&#39;s it they need to definitely I was (79:35 - 79:40)
hoping that this smaller set or whatever (79:38 - 79:41)
they&#39;re calling it that they&#39;re going to (79:40 - 79:45)
release is more trainer heavy because it (79:41 - 79:47)
would be nice there could be so many (79:45 - 79:49)
things that happen with just adding a (79:47 - 79:51)
few different trainers into the mix all (79:49 - 79:54)
of a sudden all these decks can change (79:51 - 79:56)
drastically so so or I mean that doesn&#39;t (79:54 - 79:58)
even be trainer heavy but like just make (79:56 - 79:59)
sure there are a decent amount of (79:58 - 80:02)
trainers in the in the the set so that (79:59 - 80:03)
it can really change up what&#39;s been (80:02 - 80:06)
going on the last couple months um (80:03 - 80:08)
because yeah they could do a lot with (80:06 - 80:09)
they can do a lot with a few cards they (80:08 - 80:12)
can really change things up a few cards (80:09 - 80:14)
and I think the (80:12 - 80:16)
two I don&#39;t know if we have time to talk (80:14 - 80:19)
about it but the two things that stick (80:16 - 80:22)
out of my head in my mind is are they (80:19 - 80:24)
going to do something about turn one (80:22 - 80:27)
because (80:24 - 80:27)
people aren&#39;t happy about it it&#39;s (80:27 - 80:30)
probably like the most vocal complaint I (80:28 - 80:31)
hear about the game is like turn one (80:30 - 80:35)
feels unfair uh and I don&#39;t know if (80:31 - 80:35)
I I I I I don&#39;t know if I have strong (80:36 - 80:41)
feelings about it either way because I (80:39 - 80:43)
feel like (80:41 - 80:45)
as I feel like there there&#39;s still skill (80:43 - 80:48)
level there like a better player is (80:45 - 80:49)
still going to win whether they go turn (80:48 - 80:52)
one or two turn two um unless it&#39;s Misty (80:49 - 80:54)
and you just flip like five heads off (80:52 - 80:56)
the bat and skill doesn&#39;t matter at that (80:54 - 80:57)
point (80:56 - 80:59)
um yeah I don&#39;t know what the balance (80:57 - 81:02)
for that is uh because again as somebody (80:59 - 81:03)
who used to play (81:02 - 81:05)
competitively years ago like a decade (81:03 - 81:09)
ago turn one was incredibly powerful and (81:05 - 81:11)
they over time changed the rules to (81:09 - 81:13)
balance out turn one and now people are (81:11 - 81:14)
in Pocket are saying turn two is (81:13 - 81:16)
incredibly powerful um so I don&#39;t know (81:14 - 81:19)
if there&#39;s going to be a change there (81:16 - 81:22)
and I another thing on my mind is are (81:19 - 81:26)
they going to tweak and change cards (81:22 - 81:28)
like for example with Misty it would be (81:26 - 81:30)
like this actually only works on Lapras (81:28 - 81:31)
and (81:30 - 81:35)
Blastoise um or are they just going (81:31 - 81:39)
to introduce new cards to (81:35 - 81:41)
counter other cards but there is no (81:39 - 81:42)
counter to misy right like if somebody (81:41 - 81:45)
starts turn one with (81:42 - 81:47)
Misty and flips five heads and you only (81:45 - 81:49)
have one Pokemon you just you just Auto (81:47 - 81:50)
lose you don&#39;t there&#39;s no counter to (81:49 - 81:52)
that you&#39;re just you just lost right (81:50 - 81:55)
yeah I I still think and I know that (81:52 - 81:59)
other digital card games do this they do (81:55 - 82:02)
change the the card after the card has (81:59 - 82:05)
been out so I get it like I don&#39;t play (82:02 - 82:07)
other tcgs so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know but (82:05 - 82:09)
from what I&#39;ve been told that does (82:07 - 82:12)
happen it&#39;s still feels weird to me (82:09 - 82:14)
especially because you&#39;re paying money (82:12 - 82:16)
like you&#39;re paying money to open packs (82:14 - 82:18)
and then you know pack points come up (82:16 - 82:20)
and you might craft a misty card or (82:18 - 82:21)
whatever out of the pack points and (82:20 - 82:24)
things like that that they then change (82:21 - 82:25)
that like (82:24 - 82:27)
I&#39;m spending real money to get a (82:25 - 82:29)
specific card and now you&#39;re changing (82:27 - 82:31)
what that card is after I&#39;ve like spent (82:29 - 82:33)
money to get it it&#39;s like in Pokemon (82:31 - 82:35)
unite you buy a character it&#39;s (82:33 - 82:38)
overpowered at first then they tweak it (82:35 - 82:40)
so it&#39;s less overpowered that&#39;s true (82:38 - 82:42)
they sure (82:40 - 82:44)
do uh just because they change a card (82:42 - 82:46)
though doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s completely (82:44 - 82:49)
useless no no not saying it is but like (82:46 - 82:51)
if I bought that card you know I know (82:49 - 82:53)
you don&#39;t buy Cards directly so it&#39;s (82:51 - 82:55)
like you&#39;re buying packs you&#39;re opening (82:53 - 82:57)
cards um but then you&#39;re using you can (82:55 - 83:00)
use those pack points right to then get (82:57 - 83:02)
a specific card and it feels weird it&#39;s (83:00 - 83:05)
like I got my pack points together to (83:02 - 83:07)
get this specific card from this set and (83:05 - 83:10)
then now it&#39;s not that card anymore now (83:07 - 83:11)
it&#39;s not the card that (83:10 - 83:16)
I got but I yeah I I think Hannah made a (83:11 - 83:17)
great point though there are people that (83:16 - 83:19)
will buy a character and unite just (83:17 - 83:21)
because like that is the easy win (83:19 - 83:23)
condition to spend I how much is a unite (83:21 - 83:25)
character like eight bucks 10 bucks (83:23 - 83:28)
something like that (83:25 - 83:31)
um and then when it gets nerfed or (83:28 - 83:35)
adjusted yeah then you know people move (83:31 - 83:38)
to whatever yeah that&#39;s just that&#39;s just (83:35 - 83:40)
the way that the that it works I guess (83:38 - 83:42)
so I mean like it feels weird with cards (83:40 - 83:43)
because we&#39;re so used to thinking of (83:42 - 83:45)
cards as like you have the physical (83:43 - 83:47)
thing that it itself will never change (83:45 - 83:51)
but this is different I guess yeah I (83:47 - 83:52)
guess just when I think about like how (83:51 - 83:55)
they do that in at least the Pokemon ccg (83:52 - 83:58)
the way that they Nerf those cards is by (83:55 - 84:00)
putting out something else that like (83:58 - 84:02)
balances it out versus but not always (84:00 - 84:04)
we&#39;ve had this discussion before I feel (84:02 - 84:06)
like I remember there being a case where (84:04 - 84:08)
a card was actually changed but that was (84:06 - 84:10)
yeah Pokemon catcher but then once that (84:08 - 84:12)
was because then once it phased out so (84:10 - 84:14)
like you could still use that Pokemon (84:12 - 84:16)
catcher card until it phased out of the (84:14 - 84:19)
TCG right yeah and they can just do that (84:16 - 84:22)
faster yeah I mean right in in a digital (84:19 - 84:24)
world they can do it faster I mean there (84:22 - 84:27)
there have been hard card bands in true (84:24 - 84:31)
in TCG birth rip birthday Pikachu yeah (84:27 - 84:33)
you guys know oh here we&#39;ll end on this (84:31 - 84:35)
the there there&#39;s a card called Birthday (84:33 - 84:37)
Pikachu it&#39;s like 60 HP it does like I (84:35 - 84:39)
think it does like 40 or 50 damage for (84:37 - 84:43)
one energy um or it&#39;s like it&#39;s like 20 (84:39 - 84:45)
damage I think but if it&#39;s your birthday (84:43 - 84:47)
it does more and so it was tournament (84:45 - 84:50)
legal for a long time not a long time (84:47 - 84:52)
but it was tournament legal at one point (84:50 - 84:55)
in time and (84:52 - 84:57)
uh people would bring it and play it at (84:55 - 84:59)
tournaments and they would go well it&#39;s (84:57 - 85:02)
my birthday so the car does more damage (84:59 - 85:05)
and then people would call judges over (85:02 - 85:08)
and it&#39;s a bunch of like 14 I mean like (85:05 - 85:12)
if it wasn&#39;t an adult so anyone under 17 (85:08 - 85:14)
or any anyone under 18 that wouldn&#39;t (85:12 - 85:15)
have well I don&#39;t know there&#39;s probably (85:14 - 85:17)
plenty of 18y olds that are not walking (85:15 - 85:18)
around on IDs but people would call (85:17 - 85:22)
judges over and be like it&#39;s his birth (85:18 - 85:23)
it&#39;s his birthday but it&#39;s the guy&#39;s (85:22 - 85:25)
next to him birthday but it&#39;s this guy&#39;s (85:23 - 85:27)
birthday and the judges had no way to (85:25 - 85:30)
actually like legally prove that it was (85:27 - 85:32)
the person&#39;s birthday (85:30 - 85:35)
mhm like even if they had like a school (85:32 - 85:36)
ID it&#39;s not like the school well maybe (85:35 - 85:38)
some school IDs have the birthday on so (85:36 - 85:40)
like you would go to the tournament and (85:38 - 85:42)
everyone&#39;s playing birthday Pikachu and (85:40 - 85:44)
everyone is saying it&#39;s their birthday (85:42 - 85:47)
to do more damage and they had to ban (85:44 - 85:50)
the card because there was no way to (85:47 - 85:52)
prove it was your (85:50 - 85:56)
birthday that&#39;s so good that&#39;s so (85:52 - 85:58)
good so what I&#39;m saying is they should (85:56 - 86:01)
add birthday Pikachu to pocket and um (85:58 - 86:04)
that that birthday Pikachu also uh the (86:01 - 86:06)
card if you look at the card it&#39;s like I (86:04 - 86:07)
forget exactly how it does it but (86:06 - 86:10)
there&#39;s a blank space in there it&#39;s like (86:07 - 86:12)
it&#39;s like so- and so&#39;s birthday and so (86:10 - 86:13)
the idea was when you buy the card or (86:12 - 86:16)
you you open the card you write your (86:13 - 86:19)
name right where that blank line is and (86:16 - 86:21)
so now there&#39;s a lot of people 30 years (86:19 - 86:23)
later who were like because that (86:21 - 86:25)
birthday Pikachu card exploded in value (86:23 - 86:27)
at one point in time but then all these (86:25 - 86:29)
people are like well mine has my name (86:27 - 86:31)
written on it yeah so it&#39;s not worth (86:29 - 86:34)
anything (86:31 - 86:34)
yep yeah good (86:35 - 86:41)
times uh real good okay uh that&#39;s our (86:39 - 86:44)
