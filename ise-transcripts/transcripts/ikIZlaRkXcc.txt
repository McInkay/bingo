[Music] what's up everyone welcome to the 400th episode of the Pokemon podcast it's super effective I'm your host s BJ hello hello hello Greg here hello looks like we made it to four hundredth episode well also here unfortunately I cannot be so joyful and sing-songy three hundred some-odd episodes I'm spent you guys got the best years of my life now this is it all downhill from there been downhill for a while but we're really getting towards the bottom but we're here to pick you back up and make you seem better than you are oh that's true it's like when I went to see what is it MAME is that that's the musical right yeah what's her name oh why can't I think of her name now Alicia Keys new Carol Channing Carol Channing and it's like you may as well have had a marionette profit yeah charts the end there Oh a nice are towards the end yeah what at Broadway Jim absolutely to celebrate 400 episodes this will not be a news focused show we have questions it's it's pretty much gonna be like a question only show like an email show except not emails they're one of these times you're gonna give me an extreme speed oh yeah maybe one that not that well look don't set it up too like it's gonna be later in the episode cuz it's not happy it's not it's not happening here's a clue for you Greg I've I've been on got at least 300 of these programs I've never had an extreme speed myself that classic nugget from the pre retired and I vote a glee buff I remember what the controversy around that size versus a glee buff I thought was close oh okay then I vote close I absolutely puff all the way clap we're gonna do questions pretty much the entire show and that's that's pretty much it quick updates here I still have skittle jaw how did you eat more no I didn't I was wrong with I do eat any more skittles Greg but my jaw still really hurts did you break skittle like I don't think so cuz throughout the day it doesn't hurt as much and then I go to bed and then I wake up and then it's bad again oh no you grind your teeth no it's grinding my teeth it would be on it wouldn't be one specific side yes it would yeah no I'm not grinding my teeth I can tell you exactly when the pain started it was when I bit into the skittles okay here's did you crack a tooth no no now here's what it is he sprained his jaw I think your jaw has muscles and then every night as he grinds his teeth he's do two things get yourself Invisalign because that'll keep you from grinding I'm an influencer [Music] well you're following me on my journey number 2 take some ibuprofen different bed I was taking advil that's not the same thing yeah it is ibuprofen and how many advils have you taken before you go to bed to the abbé mm mm three you gotta take four before we get to the questions I did play some mystery dungeon and I just thought that I figured we'd bring it up otherwise our for mystery dungeon people who listen to the stream are gonna have a heart attack that we haven't talked about it there are quite a few fans of mystery dungeon thank you so you can can that attitude I very much would have bought it myself because the art is absolutely delightful it says it's just too proximate to Animal Crossing and Bill is very cheap and budget oriented the art is good in graphic in moving form you can kind of see the flaws in it it doesn't translate very well to movement it looks way better when it's not moving I'll say that steal pictures and when it's still it looks better move I would do Gore watching the stream the movement looks a little it looked a little weird how far did you get did you actually recruit somebody else no I didn't get to the recruiting I will this is probably not sport well I what is this a 15 year old game yet mean I played the original young 17 years old yes I got to the first boss battle which i think is the end of the tutorial completely which is against Skarmory yeah and then I saved the Diglett yep the three dads no mom but that's all right maybe the mom maybe I gotta save the mom later and hey the mom later but yeah I got to the Skarmory battle and did that and so I will say the quiz is extremely delightful it told me I was sassy cynical but lovable did you get the hand coming out of the toilet question no no that's why you ended up that way which sassy cynical and lovable is supposed to be Treecko and I decided to pick skiddy because I like skinny a lot and then my partner I picked his Psyduck so I was very happy with the quiz I thought that was really well done except you didn't accept the result no I did the laws of history show he's okay I mean he's fine he's no skiddy he's no cubone either it does ask you bone it does ask you at the end if you are uh like a boy or a girl like the same Pokemon question that Professor Oak would ask you and I'm assuming that like because I said I'm a boy that's why they defaulted to Treecko I bet if I was to say girl Treecko wouldn't have been an option and it would probably gave me I don't know what what is like I said what would this sassy girl Pokemon be I would almost say it's probably skiddy so that's not a hundred percent true some of the nature's are differentiated by gender some of the nature's are not but so I can't remember I can look it up well that's cheating then then you look with Melvin you already did it it's not cheating if you already did it maybe ok so again this is just my quick review getting up to the Skarmory or my input oh I should also probably disclose that I guess skitty would have been hasty he hasn't been hasty to get skinny if you had said girl you had gotten Torchic oh okay I like Torchic full disclosure I did not pay for mystery dungeon it was sent to me by Nintendo big big Papa Doug Bowser sent it my way everyone says that mystery dungeons story is incredible I am only like two hours in and the dialogue is I don't know pretty like this this mystery dungeon well that's that's just like the default of like mystery dungeons is like how the story so good I think for the sequels I don't think for the original the story is okay well your dialogue is very it's just it's it's it's just standard Pokemon dialogue it's like hey so-and-so we need to go save this Diglett and then the it's just like okay it's like okay this is the Oh like the dialogue you guys are all raving about No okay sky and dialogue our story is different the serene dialogue are different the story does tend to get good the dialogue is very simple throughout the whole thing but like I feel like the dialogue adds to the story though no it came down it can but and I don't think in this case it takes away from this like once you've gotten past where you are and you've learned everything about the game like it starts getting the dialogue starts picking up more and more things start happening it does suffer like all of them because I think this was the first this is the first pokemon mystery dungeon crossover yeah I think so yeah yeah well cuz you're judging games like fun fantasy has a mystery dungeon yeah oh yes yes this was the first Pokemon mystery done so they have a very they had an unfortunately long tutorial because nobody had probably played a mystery dungeon game who had played Pokemon like this was the first introduction to this so I think the I I do sort of remember like okay I get it alright I've learned everything I get it but I think the tutorial for this was longer than it needed to be like the Sun and Moon issue but then it does pick up like what's your past that you know about bosses you know up picking up jobs you know about what all the shops are it gets it gets more interesting especially when you have more freedom so like the tutorial is a good introduction to how the game works but I don't think is a great introduction to how the story will go how the dialogue ends up being once you've gotten past that and it's not holding your hand anymore went into being very optimistic I my mystery dungeon experience prior to this who was playing my first one was gates to infinity which a lot of people say is bad and I got all the way up to the con Kaldur at the top of the mountain and gets to infinity which is I believe the first boss and then I stopped playing and then I did play two to three hours of explorers of sky and I played that with Irene and Irene was very not interested in it in about an hour she thought was kind of boring but I do remember the the coughing in it but that's all I remember and I left that game pretty unimpressed as well I will say that after how long did I play Greg like two and a half three hours on stream um I left so I left at about two hours and you're still playing okay yeah so it must have been I probably wrapped up a little bit after you left but I I am excited to continue playing it but I will say I the thing that turned me off from those first two games and that's still an issue here is the combat I don't think it's particularly fun and I still don't think it's fun here but I do I will say the auto battle thing which i think is new makes up for that the atom movement the autumn like the you can press I think it's the L button and your characters will like default and go to the that if they need to pick up and they'll explore on their own I think that's Auto explore but there's no auto combat the auto explore actually stops when you're into a combat situation yeah and I think they introduced that in the later games a pretty sure you could do that in the later games the auto explore the auto combat auto explore if there is there is no auto calm there's no the auto combat is I just press the a button and the game figures out the best attack yeah that's pretty Auto to me well but you could choose from a variety of attacks that's actually one of my biggest complaints about mystery dungeon is that you just had to like memorize all these button combos yeah press LZ I think and it will show the four attacks and then you can pick it yeah I'm most not yes you have to memorize this I'm just not interested like if I'm fighting a Zubat and I'm going to do the electric move the game is smart enough to go zubats weak to electric so I'm gonna use skitty's charge beam and that's fine that's good enough for me like I'm not here for like the one time I did stop and I was like okay I I need to the Skarmory is about to kill me I need to like not move because if you don't move they don't move yep so I'm not gonna spam the a button I'm gonna like press the LZ I'm gonna look at my attacks my fart i and it was a disaster I was like I don't know how this combat works I don't know if like if I turn does that count for a movement even though I'm still in the same square and I like tried I like hit the a button on accident no one was near me so skiddy did a spin but that counts is moving and so Skarmory gets it like it was just a complete mess and I was like you know what I'm just gonna keep pressing a button and let it auto because it was not fun to like hold the LZ it's it's not the strength of the game I was a lot unless I'm like that maybe I'm just terrible that video you are oh you are you are yes you are 100% I mean for a lot of things yes you can probably add a button to get through the boss battles like when you get seeds when you get other things those become more important to be able to use so like picking up rocks so that if you rid of all of your distance attacks you can still hit things at a distance because you can throw rocks at things as they move towards you and not waste your moves sleep seeds throwing berserk seats like confusion seeds I mean the game does get more complicated and the bosses do get a lot harder where you have to get more creative than just hitting the a button like there is a depth to that to all of the games that I think they do pretty well but you do sort of like it isn't I agree that it's not intuitive it's not a very intuitive system you do sort of have to memorize what all the seeds do and what you have like what you have to do going on later missions it becomes very important what you're bringing with you so you want to bring like I need four apples I want to bring X seeds because I know I'm gonna face a boss but I also need to leave enough space so that while I'm in the dungeon I can pick everything up that's in there like you sort of have to strike the balance between what's the minimum I can bring to deal with what I see in there versus I still need to have space to pick up things in the dungeon plus they haven't even at the point where you're in the game they haven't even done monster houses yet which is just the absolute fear in that game when you run into a monster house I can see the appeal and I think that's the thing I was excited about I don't know if this is if this was a change but like the first thing I thought of when I saw the bulletin board was oh they're gonna make me only take one mission at a time but it don't let me take 4 or 5 or something it was like okay that's awesome because three of these four are in the same cave then I was like oh okay let me pick up three I bet as soon as I complete one it's gonna kick me out but it when you complete the first mission it was like oh you can keep going if you want and I was like oh this is awesome like I can I can do all three in a run and then the risk reward is I'm either like I don't have enough apples and I'm gonna get too fatigued or I'm out of healing items and I'll have to back out and that was like the appealing part to me that was the part I actually liked not like the combat or the saving the Diglett the risk/reward of like I can go deeper into this cave and knock out all these missions if I am well-prepared and I think that is that was the fun part to me yep and it gets more complicated the more places that you open up like there are some jobs where it's just like okay the first job is on the second floor and the last job is on the 18th floor is that something that I want to do right now because the reward for the 18th floor one is huge is that do I want to spend 18 going through 8 like am I gonna go through all 18 to get there is like there's a lot to that risk reward system that's very interesting I mean it gets more interesting the more you play the game but again like but everyday thing is like every dungeon it's random which is the other thing that I I've always found fascinating about the game cuz you never like even if you were in that dungeon before it's not the same when you go back in yeah yeah I mean that's that's what's like so core oh yeah to the whole mystery dungeon it's it the dungeon is a mystery it's right in the name and like some people are like I don't want the dungeons to be randomized and it was like well number one you're playing the wrong game then step back I mean one of the things I also don't like is I actually don't like the auto explore because what that really kind of reveals for me is that the point of the game is all about prepping for the dungeon and not what you actually do in the dungeon oh I think the run is the good part that ok but for me that's I don't I the video game to actually do stuff it's not cookie clicker here you know I want to actually love a good cookie clicker yeah like a trims myself but you stream shrimps at one point for $60 on my switch I if I'm sitting on my couch in my living room with my 75 inch television I want to be engaged with the content not if watching my Cuban run through coupon Cuban I I would agree with you will if there were more to the dungeons besides like 4 items on a floor you could pick up which that's what I noticed right away and I was like maybe it's just these early dungeons and maybe they do get significantly but like besides empty rooms with enemies or like heel pads I was like I'm just picking up like an Oran berry like why there's no puzzles like there's no puzzles to solve to get through the dungeons other then let me make sure that I've got enough you know the kit in my bag to get through this thing there are some I mean so at later dungeons you get the shops leader dungeons you get the monster houses like they they do change it up as the difficulty ramps up there are spas there are hidden things to find if they were generated so to say that it's always the same I don't think is fair but you may not find the little things that they add in interesting enough to do X amount of floors of random generated dungeons like they do get more complicated there are more complicated things to do but they do come very late in the game and they may not be you I mean for some people it's too late you know it's too little too late like there's just not enough oh absolutely oh you didn't you didn't grab my attention with you know an hour and a half's worth of play I'm not putting more time in it like the recruitment parts are like part of it I haven't gotten there I know it's gonna be frustrating to me is is recruitment is frustrating it can be finding the scars to make recruitment easier buying those things like that's all part of the equipping to make that process better but it's still it's still like you have no real control over who you recruit like it is a random chance after that unlocks that whoever you defeat in a dungeon will join you like there are ways to manipulate it but it's still not it's not a given like you can find that shiny and it could be like nope I'm out um overall I yeah I guess I I don't regret my time with it I think it's I think it's fun I want to see where it goes more I guess both of you didn't think it was worth the 60 bucks so I mean I had played it before I've played that game completely before and when looking at it thinking I'm still very heavily invested in sword and shield yes I may be investing in Animal Crossing I'm still deciding I have a lot of friends who want me to that I you do you bud you did a game the game that game coming in between these two things I was like I know how heavily I can get into mystery dungeon is not a short game I'll play it a lot the other games that are I'm playing still have my attention right now like Final Fantasy just released another huge patch it's got a whole bunch of new dungeons that I'm working through I'm still doing raids in sword and shield and that eats up that time it just I didn't feel that I wanted to pay $60 to play again that I've already played I played it the first time I liked it the first time I didn't think there was enough changes in this version to warrant me playing it again I mean it's mostly like updated art and nostalgia yeah a different piece di the different ways of doing rescues and everything for me like if it what it really boils down to is if I had more time and Animal Crossing wasn't just like right on the horizon next week which I know I want to spend my time with Animal Crossing I definitely would have bought this game I got that I downloaded the demo I enjoyed the demo and it's like if I had more time I would have made this my game that I play every morning you know when I first wake up and like do a dungeon every morning or something stupid like that but I I know I'm gonna invest heavily in Animal Crossing and be disappointed in a month and a half and then maybe I'll come back to mystery dungeon at least for that month and a half Animal Crossing is gonna have my attention you know this guy will be there Animal Crossing for me is like a top 5 game of all time but they did really say it's no Katamari Damacy did release multiple games that I did not like before so that's why I'm like very hesitant I know people are over the moon and excited and if there's like a single new flower and showing off an animal crossing and alienating like an 18 thread post on Twitter about how this new flower is amazing but I just can't help but remember we game was so bad oh stop stop stop I love the weekend just okay generally from your let's put it this right from your perspective it was bad from my perspective it was absolutely fantastic and I adored it but my advice is no wild world and it was no new leaf I mean I think I only really played new leaf which was the ds1 wild world yet that was probably a crowning achievement whole franchise yeah how do you follow up one of the button the best Animal Crossing game ever yeah I mean we bad town remember advice for anybody who is you know either just like not one of those it's Animal Crossing I'm gonna get it and love it doesn't matter what it is because it has the Animal Crossing name on it so it was like if you've never played before if you've been away from it for a while and coming back or you know it's just like my one piece of advice is for when you first start it but I would say even like for a week don't discuss it with anybody play it on your own terms learn about the game understand the game on your own terms because the minute you start talking to other people and especially if you talk to the real anime Nia and it will cross what is what are the people who are very into Animal Crossing I really the X cross heads the cross heads yeah and they start telling you about like all the achievements that they've already unlocked in the secret areas they've unlocked and they've got this in their town and that in their time and you're gonna be like well I'm not going that fast and now I feel bad there's like this uncontrollable psychological impact that you will have that you're going to feel bad because you're not making as much progress as other people and just like save yourself from that keep your animal crossing' experience to yourself for a while until you feel like you have accomplished enough and you're at a point where you want to ask other people for advice on how to get things because then it's less about feeling bad that you fell behind but more like I've gotten to this point was I've gotten as far as I can get on my own and it's time for me to reach out to others so I can get even further now you're gonna you're gonna be behind off the bat if you didn't find five other friends with the different fruits to get the fruits to plant better fruits to themselves for the money and so then you can start but like I either fruits for a while I'm just saying for an enjoyable experience of like creating and crafting your own town which is the core of the Animal Crossing experience do it on your own for a while no I agree with what you said well I do agree that there's the psychological thing where like somebody has like five public work projects in the first week and you don't and sometimes that just comes down to luck sometimes like well in past games it was just like oh so-and-so was able to say the right thing in the right time frame and you know you can build a lighthouse and you know I played the game for six months and I never got anyone to offer me to build a lighthouse even though you know I did everything the guide said to do but they're still like this hidden percent chance that you might not be offered to build the lighthouse like I I get it but yeah it was it was frustrating during new leaf to see everyone on Twitter posting all that all their public works or all their cool things and and by I didn't get offered those things even though I was playing just as much or or like I have no clue if they they time hopped and that's why they have 18 public work projects in a week none of this makes sense that anyone who's played on will crossing they probably what's the Public Works I don't even know if there's Public Works in this game I'm not sure I don't I've watched the one Nintendo Direct kind of and happy to know that time hopping will not be possible thank you to the incorporation of the see you people will still be able to tell hot they won't be able to time hop to a season but they'll still be a person but they won't be able to do events sure so they could still put you know a thousand bells in a bank and set it five years in the future to whatever interest rate that is don't don't tell these people about secrets I'm very excited for animal crossing but I but going back to mystery dungeon I did hear that same opinion that oh I would have picked up mystery dungeon but I didn't want to spend $120 this month and I only have 60 bucks and if it's between mystery dungeon or animal crossing I'm gonna buy Animal Crossing I've heard that so much in the past two week the timing the timing is real rough and I don't know I I don't know like my own completely biased view is that they have a lot of crossover between pokémon and animal crossing that's probably not true it's just what I see because I have a very limited scope of what's out there but it does seem like the timing was a bit hmm it's it's partially it's a bit of revenge because the last time an animal crossing game came out on a system Pokemon X&Y came out like two months later and everybody was like Animal Crossing whoo oh I don't know her that I did yeah as I got mout what happened to me as well so that's why now Animal Crossing is getting a little micro revenge on Pokemon poor poor pokemon mystery dungeon didn't ask for this fight but it's gotten yanked into it either anyway I don't know the new max rates are hard to resist we got to get a my champ I haven't done the MA champ yet I had I found one but it's isn't it sorta like it will appear in the other it's mostly sword Machamp is five-star only in sword gangers five star only in shield but three and four stars will have both yeah I got a I got a three star my champ in mind the 300 of four stars have a 10% chance of appearing and then the five stars have a 20% chance of appearing before anyone tweets at me saying that Machamp a gang gar in both games we're talking specifically about promoted race but way I've got the Giganta mechs Gengar multiple times maybe I was on other people's yeah yes so like if I'm playing shield you can I can find gang gars quicker than a sword player can and I can invite you to mine you never do hey that code is usually five five five five five not that's you change it a lot you start your codes with zero we talked about this like I don't start oh yeah well no that's that's like trade codes grade codes for raid codes raids don't matter anyways because most people want everybody between five five five five five and 77077 a lot so don't say it's always cuz I have seen you do well sometimes it's awful yeah so I was like nah don't fall for your lies that you're trying to spread that you can not watch your stream and get into your raids look look let's take a break when we come back well we'll start our questions we get a bunch of questions from all over the internet so we will take a quick break and we will be right back [Music] [Music] alright let's dive into some questions we're not sure I'm ready to handle this let's start off with uh what is your social security number date ah svet Nick 24 this is off our subreddit says episode 400 question how have your Pokemon that tastes tastes changed over the 400 episodes for example is there a Pokemon you absolutely hated towards the beginning of time beginning of the time you began that you liked now is there a game that you liked that you never wanted to touch again thanks for all the fun I started listening to you guys when sword and shield were first announced and I've been here every week since Congrats on 400 how have my Pokemon tastes changed hmm the weirdest thing for me is among my favorite Pokemon are fire types like cyndaquil Victini stuff like that but if you were to ask me like my favorite type of pokemon fire type is not like the actual type hmm I like fairy and I like grass and I like bug a lot my fairy bug Pokemon the missing one is there I think I've grown to appreciate far-fetched more because of the podcast I think over time I've begun to hate the mechanical ones more so like I was okay with I didn't think of a lot about them but then once you're sort of on a show and you have to think about them I think my dislike for things like Magnemite and clinking clanging in all of them so how's your I was pretty much the apotheosis of the nadir of Pokemon life for you yep don't like it at least for me over 400 episodes I think you realize how just like your tastes do change over time and there's document documentation it's very true there's people who've been listening for a long time who can pull out some old chestnuts and I'm like actually even people who haven't been listening for a long time but decide to go through that back catalogue and they're like I remembered 30 years ago you said look I don't remember what we said last week so don't worry about 30 years ago I definitely remember early on looking for Pokemon that felt nice like grumpig or even gold duck I think at the time although like I had a pretty good story with gold duck but now I like those let's Pokemon I don't think about as much and it's probably because we have like more Pokemon and more Pokemon that I can that I like significantly more than the grumpy I like I don't get any problems with grumpig but also at the same time no one ever talks about grumpig it's probably like that whole like psychological or social psychology thing where it's like you can only have like eight close friends or something like that and like once you get another close friend one of those other ones gets knocked out of it and it's like you once Crammer and showed up some other there you were wild for Krammer and pretty wild for em right yeah all right I also think like Steve you probably have a very different experience about your changing tastes because you're just younger like four will and I we weren't kids when all of this started we were very true in our 20s so you as you know a kid like that when you become adult going back to those games is a very different experience for you than it is for me because I have very once you get past 20 kids you taste don't change that much they change some but not as wildly as if you were 10 when the games came out and now here you are in your 30s trying to go back to those games because you'll see the flaws that you didn't see as a kid whereas for me I saw the flaws immediately because they weren't my childhood games like I have gotten back to my childhood we came to go why did I like this which is a lot of the five advantageous I thought I thought et on the Atari 2600 was an amazing advantage I was never that dumb I am also younger than you I was a single child I don't think that counts is dumb I think like a game like Pokemon Co has has has done that for specific Pokemon like I don't think a lot of people really particularly cared about what's a good example maybe like China or Zola oh yeah corsola that's a good one too or like Chimecho which is incredibly rare and spawns in the wild and when somebody if somebody saw their first Chimecho that would probably be pretty exciting if oh well unless they're extremely casual and they didn't know how rare Chimecho is but hi me raise his hand yeah check that goes real real real rare Pokemon go and if you catch it fun fact you get 3,000 Stardust instead normal whatever start us you would get does it gives you bonus start us checking to see if I got Chimecho pay the most passive player I think as I've met more people through the podcast like their their favorite Pokemon has raised my opinion of that Pokemon some learning people's favorites has also changed my perspective on them a little like listening to the PAX East West South list is always fascinating and that does change some things that's true that's fun I actually from my involvement in the podcast I just feel like I found out so much more in-depth stuff about individual Pokemon like I always really enjoyed the electric whine mm-hmm but then it's like in like learning about it and researching it and finding out that only the middle evolution ever learns any new moves or anything and like the first evolution and the last evolution can't learn any new moves that looks like fascinating yeah it's really it's really cool makes that Pokemon that much cooler to have that deeper knowledge of how it operates do you guys think that Pokemon will one day allow you to play as an adult protagonist in the series if so what kind of things would you like to see any more mature take on Pokemon I think they already started leaning into this a little bit this is actually a really good question this was from ty on reddit yep so in sword and shield unless I'm terribly mistaken I don't think I am they actually don't mention your age at all which i think is a really good first step in general yeah I I don't think it's any secret and I'm sure the Pokemon company knows better than we do of you know who's buying their game where they're buying their game the age of those players the the background of those players whether they're college students or high school students or you know working adults I'm sure they know all that information that they will probably never release but I'm almost positive they don't mention your age at all I don't think they do I don't remember them I think the main problem with that concept like let's say we had the opportunity to do full character customization and you could set whatever age you wanted your character player character to be in the game the issue with that is kind of impactful on the story because if I were to start the game as a 47 year old why don't I have any Pokemon yeah yeah yeah you know it's like the starting the game as a youth kind of is the impetus for why you're starting a Pokemon journey versus well I guess I never did the Pokemon thing even though my entire world we help pokemon guess I'll get into it now I mean I think they will never I think like Steve said the abstraction will continue like they will probably just drop the age completely and just never mention it I think they might do more with customization so that you'd have a little bit more to look a little younger or a little older if you wanted but I don't think I think in games like this it pays better for them to have that avatar be more general than specific and it allows like them to tell the story that they want to tell without having it to be like well why would an adult listen to these people like why that wouldn't happen and exactly like they do mention that you're younger in sword and shield in the fact that Sonia and Leon are like let the adults handle this a couple of times like they do they do point out that you are younger while not ever stating that you are an exact age it is definitely implied that you are at least pre 18 or whatever they consider an adult I thought pre 18 is probably the best way to put it somewhere probably somewhere between 12 and 18 i thinik this I don't know that we will get anything out of making adult protagonists that isn't already like I don't know that that enhances the game because I think it's a different question than what do you think is and the more maturity cuz I think you can still do more mature and still have a youngish protagonist yeah I mean I I've always said that like a lot of people missed the the story beats of Sun and Moon or ultra sudden ultramoon where that just in case maybe you skipped over because the tutorial was too long in Sun and Moon one of the core parts of the storyline is about verbal abuse between adults and kids specifically with like Lily and Lucy mean and that's as pretty mature as it gets and I've always said that like most adults don't understand verbal abuse yeah more or less like kids understanding it just some trivia here Calum and Serena they never talk about their ages in X&Y yeah I was gonna say it in any of the games which of the games have they specified your age they specify and like red and blue that you're like 10 years old I think and gold and silver they also specify 10 years old in Sun and Moon they actually specify that you're 11 years old we have a Celine and Elio I think their names are and then so they didn't specify age and X&Y and they didn't specify age in sword and shield at least in the video games I don't know they might have in the manga what do we think like more mature take on Pokemon I don't know I think think they can like they started to do more mature storylines and sunny Sunday moon I think they can definitely do that in a more mature take on it I like it have to really be a one-off and then have to be really careful about what they decide to take on part of the charm is for me is that it's somewhat abstracted that there's an abstraction there and it doesn't really ask you to think much deeper than what they're presenting you I think the danger of doing a more mature take on anything is you can unless you're incredibly careful you'll easily make something very problematic and as people have proven it's hard for them to accept new visions and new takes on things without it affecting their previous experiences of it true um so I think they could probably tell deeper stories but I think they should probably limit that to more interpersonal stories like they did in Sun and Moon and they touched a little bit and sword and shield like you know beads entire storyline it's probably one of the best things about Sargent shield and I think they can do more of that and get into that in more depth but I think they would probably want to avoid the weird conversations P people have about your relationship with Pokemon and what that actually looks like I think delving really far into that without being super careful about it is gonna be super problem they already avoid the the hard conversations of like oh we don't know what to do with loose I mean yeah chairman rows just disappeared didn't he yeah so I think there's a couple of issues also with a more mature take right just the concept of that one is a lot of times people take more mature to mean darker Khurram which does not have to be the teh the case it can just mean more complex and introducing more complexity into the story concepts of the game where there's more subplot sub deeper you know characterization and everything but the main issue that I think will always be the biggest hurdle to a quote more mature take on Pokemon is Pokemon is intended to be an all-ages game and once you make it you know Final Fantasy 10 that really takes out a lot of the younger audience right because kids you know from maybe like six years old to eleven years old aren't interested into a troubled romance of separated lovers right which is you know that's a good trope in a mature more mature well I I will never say pokemons a kids game I will always say it's an all-ages games and I think that the intent of the creators of Pokemon is forward to always be an all-ages game and it would take a huge shift in their philosophy to move away from the concept yeah an all-ages game I will say this that I would like and unfortunately people will see this as a more mature take on Pokemon it's not I would like to see a wider variety of relationships represented in my Pokemon games like we are finally starting to get there with skin color diversity it would be nice to have other diversity that is not considered mature but just part of the universe they got Steven and Marlon Wow Oh razor blade here on reddit asks do you think if Pokemon was never made could there be another game that would have created the same impact or impression in your life if so which one Final Fantasy was that game until Pokemon came like AI is a huge huge huge final fantasy fan and I still AM to some extent but not not as much as I am with Pokemon so pokum I never existed then I would have I would be probably in the Final Fantasy podcast that's the deepest and darkest timeline right there yep I mean I've already recorded 15 episodes of Katamari cast and just not released yet I haven't yet how rude look there's a long line of people who want to be on Katamari cast so you know we get your turn I'm one of the cousins you have to unlock they rolling me up I he go for me it probably would have been like a World of Warcraft or another mm oh I don't know whatever no mmo's existed back in the against whatever quest I think was whatever request was that whatever crush was the big one before I mean there are a bunch of small ones yeah like EverQuest was the was it was EverQuest and then Wow happened and there was like ever what that's uh no play why cuz why was fun yeah so I I don't even think that if Pokemon didn't have the transfer from Pokemon to Pokemon from each game I don't think it would have been as impactful as it was on me and an MMO has always kind of had that and that's why I like I was so into destiny and they they kind of ruined that but I put a lot into the first three years of Destiny because I wanted to collect everything because I was sold that this would be like a ten year game and it ended up being a three year game and you got to start over in year four which kind of killed a lot for me and the internet was not very if we're gonna be a destiny three cuz I I know I could get back into it TV now Bungie is working on a game for some big Chinese money that said that game is not destiny [Laughter] in the pockets of big China you can't cuz you're allergic to soy look there are soy alternatives not according to bake China big China or not I am confident that there are people who gave up on Pokemon when the jump from gen 2 to Gen 3 was made there were some definitely yeah yeah but it was necessary I was still stand by Jed 3 is the most important Jen so ok let's let's put it this way thinking of impact on your life what game outside of Pokemon has had the biggest impact on your life Oh Shining Force Shining Force yep absolutely uh so Shining Force was the first when I snuck down to Chicago when my then boyfriend now husband's parents were gone for the weekend and we were looking for something to do that we keep us in inside because going out in public as a couple was a little risky what wasn't a thing during those days it wasn't a thousand risky because he had nosy neighbors and I wasn't supposed to be there we went to Blockbuster and rented a Sega and rented Shining Force and played that game all weekend we didn't leave the house we ordered food in and we just played that game which is it's why my wedding invites were Shining Force things I wouldn't know I wasn't invited I didn't know you then and the one person I sort of knew Steve didn't come how rude but like that game is huge like that game is huge in my life um simply because I have so many positive memories attached to it like that was that is that's like like everybody has us like this is our song that is our game like that is a game we talk about that is a game we played a lot of with that is a game that was a huge bonding thing for my husband and I so like that is a that is a big game in my life but like there's not a lot of them and they didn't they just stopped sending him over here so it didn't have a continuation but I will always put that as an important game in my life that's like probably the most important game in I would probably say for myself obviously Katamari Damacy is it just very much like if you put cut Amar'e Damacy on something you're gonna get will Anderson's money that's more because just the gameplay is so simple but yet still engaging and it's just almost like you know encapsulated joy that you just you go in there the way the music and the graphics and everything comes together you you can't step away unhappy right it just brings happiness into your heart playing Katamari Damacy it's it's silly but you know you listen to that music and you just you know you're rolling that ball you're picking up weird things who even knows why anything's happening that's that I will say that the one game that like for story that I got really engrossed in and just like looked forward to and very unhappy that you can't get it anymore you know that it's not available not pushed forward into systems is everything from the legacy of kain Soul Reaver series just because I just found that that whole like what is it like the environment and the lore and everything of those games which I think there were like five or six of the games I only play her a lot of them I only played like the last three or four of them when they were on like ps1 ps2 with Raziel it's just like it was so gripping for me and that I would like literally like call in sick to work to sit at home and play that game for eight hours just to get through it to see how the story was gonna unfold and you know there wasn't much internet to look at back you know when those games were out but I would look up and I was like what what can I find out about like these other extra dimensional creatures that are involved in like all the twists and the different things that were happening and how different people were being manipulated and it's just like that game like if I could get a master series of that but in saying all of that I was just reminded that I was going through some boxes and I found my mist masterpiece edition Oh miss and that game I can just I can think back to like 1994 and sitting in front of a computer for six hours trying to solve those puzzles I put it in my computer like last week and I can't even play it because the graphics are so bad it doesn't can't even render the graphics but boy oh boy Myst was a game changer and has never been replicated absolutely not again when it comes to lore and just like the simplicity of what it offers but the depth of what it communicates that's there you go all right Steve what's your answer ah destiny we did have a lot of good times with destiny that's true maybe I will say world Warcraft was my first MMO and that that was a game changer as far as what mmo's were hey spj and crew my birthday is coming up March 15th and I wanted to let you guys know that you really helped me get through the day and I appreciate you all I started listening to your podcast last fall when I was getting back into Pokemon after a hiatus of not playing thank you for reading is this a question long thing thank you for reinvigorating my interest in a franchise I loved so dearly I was wondering what your very first shiny pokemon you caught was and what went through your head when you saw that sparkle mine was in a lowland Geodude I remember feeling my heart skip a beat as the excitement set in because it was a complete surprise that's from Aiden I know what mine was you do know yeah what was it so I was playing I want to say it was diamond and I was over in an area that sort of you know that because they have that separate island that you went to and I was traveling through and a lady and popped up and it was shiny and I'm like oh oh really this is my first shiny lady in fine and then I caught it that was my first wild shiny I will say the first shiny that I hunted ever was i bred the shiny Rosalia in emerald but that was like me specifically hunting for that so finally getting it because there were there was no way of manipulating at odds I was like I don't know thousands of eggs in and it finally happened that was just like a relief so it wasn't like I don't really count that as my first shiny because I was specifically trying to get that so my first ever wild encounter was lady and it was like yeah I'm pretty sure I'm not a hundred percent sure but I'm pretty sure my first wild yeah really my first shiny for me was in white - I got a shiny lilipop on that ranch where they had the look the herd ears and the little pups and everything right in this starting part so that I was you know a little excited for it [Music] I think I named it after my dog at the time but probably my most exciting shiny moment was in X&Y when I was in that forest before you get to the where the Mewtwo is like the animal village area you know that forest maze you had to do in X&Y yeah yeah and I came across a trevenant in a horde battle and I was just like it was like so unexpected and so surprising for me and like the way that like the trevenant shiny looks especially when you're in a horse rally and there's like one white one the other dark ones that that that was like probably my most exciting shiny moment way better than ledian steve do you are you even able to feel excitement about chinese anymore oh like an act I've no it's not an act I've come full circle in Chinese from not caring about them sooo caring about them kind of going back to not caring about them I don't have like I think all my all my shiny moments are documented pretty well so how hard is it to get a shiny authentic authentic synesthesia will they have a mark though uh what is it wait what what's the mark marks are ribbons you I know nothing about synesthesia ste I just keep buying pots I still haven't even in care I have on wait is this a genuine question if you don't know what marks are I'm not I don't know what marks are marks are ribbons except you cannot earn them they just appear I'm Pokemon when you catch them how are they the titles yes yeah there's like 25 of them I think search for them in Pokemon home um I don't think you can search by I don't think it ends in home I don't think so I may have a bunch of marks and just not even realize it that's possible yeah you have to Gaja live in and then hit up and down and check them all boy oh boy got a check up mo ah this is for McQueen Hawk loved Maddy on the mood move at this episode probably my favorite segment so far and then brown speckled bear also said this episode was great loved Maddy on the move I liked when you guys got into the weeds about different types of pokémon that have been given out in the past including Steve's freak out over pokemon box also if anyone knows I can't get into my Pokemon past anymore has this been killed by the Pokemon company I forgot to claim my shiny so gaily oh uh yeah I don't think Pokemon past works anymore that Pokemon past personally because it wasn't released worldwide this is just my opinion I think it was literally just a testing bed for what Pokemon home will do in the future when it comes to codes and generating stuff although the shiny so gaily Oh shiny Luna thing I think actually expired expired January 15th it mine says new activities coming soon I'm sure that I don't see why they would rely on Pokemon passed since Pokemon home is worldwide yeah and I think they specifically said that it's going to have features that basically replicate what Pokemon past was doing yeah I mean if you go into Pokemon home there's like a mystery gift area yeah mystery gift and then check for local events which Pokemon Paz was doing and then the gift box is where you would see the past things you've redeemed before so I'm assuming if they do another target event you walk in you open Pokemon home you go to local event check it checks your GPS and does does the thing it does this is from Dirk off our off our youtube comments if you could have a new app record ball and sword and shield but what would it do a slash look like oh boy Hey [Applause] I try to remember what ones we already have dive bar a ball lower ball well that Mazda Abercorn I think there's well I think there needs to be a rework to some of the balls being dipolar ball are like very similar like lower ball specifically works if you're fishing but dive ball specifically works when you're like on water or fishing which is but there's like three balls for water types a bug so let's see we got level ball friend ball lure ball moon ball heavy ball fastball and love ball and love ball works when you're like catching of opposite-gender right oh yeah of your own fastball fastball is based on their speed right like the faster they are the more accurate it is I think so level balls heavy ball yeah which doesn't work on gigantic max Pokemon because they don't wait I mean it can work it was playing with it Paul using a moonstone yep that's like real psyllium so lure ball is catching fishing line easier mm-hmm but netball applies the whole water pokemon right friend ball just makes them friendlier and love of all is what level of their lower level than you right it increases the catch rate by how high your level is higher level you are from them the better the catch rate is a well it's the difference between your levels yes so that's so I would make I would make the diamond ball that makes catching things that evolve using a shiny stone easier it'd be yeah why is there a moon ball yeah it's why is that yeah that's wild but yeah so let's I would go with diamond ball I have half of the evolution stones and just give me like a sin oh stoner you know of a stone no we already got rid of the mossy rock in the icy Rock yeah taking away the whole challenge of this game man every day every day I'm over there at Stonehenge grubbing in the ground to see what kind of rock is my life I'm like is the ebee that I need there no not s beyond today alright let me kill that bugger okay now I'm gonna go ground grass Krauts for rocks at Stonehenge on an unrelated note I do like how they give you a limited amount of appra corn balls because it does encourage you to breed and trade yeah umm which is nice I don't know if you know I know before anyone goes well like the deals little C says we'll get more APRA corn balls sure there's also a way to get more a pecan balls now and it's through the champion Cup and good luck because I've known people who have done 30 40 50 champion cup battles in a day and haven't gotten a single one is they did say there's gonna be a way to get a pro corn balls it could be incredibly easy or it could be incredibly tedious like the champion Cup we don't actually know but I do like the limited ecosystem of they're giving you a reason to trade because I don't think there's a lot of good reasons to trade right now like oh I already have a liquid tongue why do I need your lookit tongue butt I don't have a looking to Alec a tongue in a friend ball so I would gladly take that from you I'm surprised there's not pokeballs based off weather conditions like this one works in the rain this one works in the snow this one works in the same storm and yeah why don't we have a dawn ball to go along with the desk ball dusk ball works at night can I get something to work in the day y'all is so y'all need to pick which one are you making I already picked my ball you're all talk about what we're missing which one are you adding I would add a poke ball that works in the snow a snow ball I am gonna make a ball that works only on water pokemon that are actually fish [Laughter] no amphibians nothing that's like a boat add you know only Golden's though they Ximena curse and Brooks Isha's Dreyer CC King um you know I think I would go with the dawn ball I like balance right I like balance my if they're gonna be a dusk ball I want to do one ball right if there's gonna be a heavy ball I want a light ball there's a light bulb Pikachu can hold it it makes him aware boy editor needed to go back and make some adjustments on that yet good I like this one which game Pokemon or not gives you the most nostalgia or remind you of your childhood that was from Stephanie on YouTube space invaders my child yeah boy space invaders was huge they played that game a lot in the old arcade yeah centipede probably for me centipede actually had a book on like strategies for me I had a book and strategies for centipede I had a book and strategies for asteroids asteroids I could not play I did the physics in that game yeah the physics in the yard my narrow unforgiving I won game that I just like I was obsessed with and I just could not play Robotron I actually had a book I'm like a robot Ron hated it cuz I couldn't play it because the two joysticks were what I'm one was always broken well but the thing is like Robotron had such depth of story for ya I mean for the arcade game that it was at a chunk you've gotta save your family from becoming mutants it was dark I will say the other one that's really big Dragon's Lair my brother and I played a lot and we would act out the levels at home to try to figure out to get the timing down to do them right so you get the end so I have a fondness for Dragon's Lair only as a connection to my brother but thanks player was the one that was kind of animated yeah it was the animated one could never get past the first level I like Space Ace better but Dragon's Lair was the first my brother and I planted a lot at the skating rink you know but in middle school I used to play I think it was jump man I'm not 100% sure if that was the name of it because there's a couple of games that are very similarly named but it was literally it was like like almost like a mario clone you're just on Platteville IMing up and down and then jumping to collect rings and you had to collect all the Rings in the level to complete the level man I would obsess on that game I was a huge fan of Donkey Kong jr. I my first game that I collected actual things for was pac-man like I had peckmon sheets I had a pac-man book and a pac-man arcade machine like man you had pac-man fever okay yeah I couldn't help them I had that of them that I listened to it a lot all right so eighties time is over see what's yours how can I compete with v's though you can't but try probably Sonic the Hedgehog 2 & 3 uh and gotta invest probably wrists are for the games that was a lot of my younger childhood that wasn't Pokemon wrists star yeah it was made by it was a Sega Genesis game I can confirm the name of the game was jump man excellent oh wait I know wrists are I do know that game all right sta oh right yes yeah it was developed and published by Sega I can't remember it there's a the people who made it made like some other popular games too but I probably played that game a million times because I like if there's no wrists are cast nope no no real star cast at all no deep lore about a game series that's no longer made I'm gonna be silent for the rest of the episode as I watched youtube videos of Jumpman bankers it's nice knowing y'all are there any jump man speedruns it's all speedruns dude I will do one more question before I break this is from Stev should I get Animal Crossing no yes I don't know I haven't decided it don't ask me these things what you want out of life I mean should you learn to play guitar should you take up knitting should you lift heavy I mean maybe I okay I will say this as in most animal crossing games if you are on the fence at all buy it within the first week or so when everybody's still really active and you can go visit everybody's towns about a month later when everybody's really upset about the fact that you know checking every day all the casuals are gone and all the hardcore players are there and those people are wild so get in early and get out early if you're gonna do it yeah I would agree with that if you're gonna pull the trigger you better pull it on day one day what are at least week one while people are still really jazzed about it if you're friends with Nick in Canada you can buy it any time because he will take your town under his wing and turn it into a glorious Empire I'm not friends with Nick in Canada though so well I mean that's that's what's holding you back I know I need to go to Canada as well why start now I'm just not going to we'll take a break when come back we have some more questions to get through so we will be right back [Music] do you really want to suffer through this yes [Music] [Music] all right this is from monster off YouTube hey Pokemon podcast I found the podcast long time ago around episode 150 or so but unfortunately I stopped listening for a really long time when I still found you guys are still doing podcasts I immediately searched on Spotify and not for the past two months months I've been listening every week so glad to find you guys again with all those years you really hope be you really helped me cope with my passing of my great-grandmother at a time I have many questions I could ask but I feel this is the most fitting what is your favorite Pokemon and why love hearing your responses I love you guys keep up the good work probably documented illicits changed - cram rant and what I'm whole time will and why and why hey don't ask questions you don't want answers for I want an answer oh yeah it's part of the question the dirtiness of chroma rant I think it's really cute and really fun to look at I think it's just a fun design overall do you like cute pokemon or cool a pokemon all of the world divided or cool cute and cute cool I mean - well document I love the entire Rosalia line Rosalia is probably my favorite although I'm very partial to rosebud you can actually use it in the game for to do things it the design to me is just like it's super cute also I like a lot of the thought that but behind it I think is really I think it's a really interesting take on a plant coming to life along the lines of oddish is like another type of awe dishes of rose plant coming to life I use it to defeat the battle tower in Colosseum like I've had a strong attachment to that Pokemon ever since I first taught in Ruby and Sapphire and it's just it's cute it's tiny its powerful like it hits all the boxes that I like and I think it's really well design my favorite Pokemon just changes too much I mean cyndaquil is like an always there because my you know when I my first Pokemon game was yellow so I didn't get to pick a starter so when I got pokemon gold and I got to pick a starter that's when I picked cyndaquil because the other starters are hot garbage coal wreck but man it's just like it if I was gonna get a tattoo of a Pokemon I think I'd really get a Victini like a really like well drawn good like realistic art Victini I think would be that spot for me just because I'd like I really appreciate what Victini represents and it like I like to like be reminded of like that positive thinking that comes behind Victini that's probably gonna be the one that like sticks with me for a really long time Congrats on 400 episodes SBJ will Greg and all of the other co-hosts that have graced this podcast over the years not gonna make this comment very long but thank you to everyone who has contributed to the many aspects of pkmn cast over the years I know that the show has personally impacted my life in more ways than one the amount of work and dedication that is put into the show is truly remarkable there is no way I can repay you all for the amount of enjoyment I have received from this show Congrats on 400 years to the next 400 thanks Pat from pallet that wasn't a question Patrick so I will ask the question that he asked me earlier today which was will you tell Steve and Greg congratulations on 400 episodes and I texted him back and said no perfect self dude [Laughter] Dakota says hey new to the podcast Mike new to the podcast hot quest odd quest my question is how does everyone's schedule end up working asking for my own contemplation like how do we make recording this work ah yeah I mean I guess I mean you guys have it easy yeah yeah I mean excuse I mean I do specifically set aside time like Sundays are around the time that we schedule are just always a no like I have something to do um if it's unavoidable then we'll talk about when we can schedule it but it isn't I think it isn't easy like it is a priority that is on my calendar to say no I this time is blocked off and I have changed my shopping patterns and eating patterns to adjust accordingly we have over the past seven and a half years that I've been doing this program migrated the day that we record this program so frequently yeah I mean you you you just like try try to sit down day time but also have the flexibility understanding that things happen in people's lives that we have to you know accommodate for and I mean the the biggest driving factor is obviously Steve wants to be able to stream Monday through Saturday and I think what a lot of people don't understand is editing a podcast does take a lot of time and focus and like that's not just the recording part that's listening back making sure the audio quality is top-notch and I hope everyone appreciates the amount of work that Steve goes puts into making like really good sounding audio because you can I mean if you want me to point you to some really bad sounding podcasts out there so you can learn to appreciate what you're getting in your ears right now I've got a list but yeah even cuz I edit my own podcasts and you know just the time and effort to try to make sure that they sound good it's it's a lot it's on that's why I do it so you don't want to be doing that on a day you know that you're also required to be streaming required for four or five hours also and and I don't know like if Steve and Greg feel the same way one of the other hard things is it's almost like you don't get a day off from work at all because like for me I work Monday to Friday and then Saturday is when I edit the card fight Vanguard podcast that I do right so that's like I have to do that on Saturday I want to keep to a schedule where I am releasing that podcast on Saturdays so like for me Saturday is a work day and then Sunday when we record this it's like I my Sunday is organized around recording this program I mean I do it because I like to do it right I enjoy the feedback that I get from people that they like hearing the things that we have to say that we you know make them laugh make them happy and everything I was like that there's value in that but it's comes of the amount of work that we put into it we made it a priority yes I just have to make like I also work Monday through Friday I record Tuesday nights I have set events where I have to see people like as an adult I've always had this like like Wednesday's are off-limits because that's when I go see a certain group of friends we've all agreed as adults this is the time that we're gonna see each other because if you don't schedule a time you don't it's so easy to lose track of well I'm super tired or you know I've got this coming on or I have this free time so I'm gonna go get this project like it's really easy as an adult to if you don't make time for it tell just let it go by because there's so many different things pulling your attention so like I have a very like people oh I have set schedule of when I see people for certain things like Thursday night magic recorded Tuesdays I Saturday mornings I do work on the game that I put out and getting that out like I have to schedule these things so hey I don't get overwhelmed but B they don't just disappear yeah I mean I'm living in a no day off cycle which is is you know what I signed up for I kind of thought about that a little bit more cuz my dad I was talking to my dad the other day and he was like he's like I don't understand why you you keep doing this like you don't have a day off is it really worth the money you're making and I guess you could easily ask that question to like an actor or an actress or a wrestler or a musician I'm sure somebody who is touring the world I'm sure that's very hard on them yep I left acting for that very reason I left acting because you when when you did get a day off it meant you weren't getting paid anything like it's an incredibly hard life and I decided that that wasn't worth it hey hey find a job you love and you'll never work a day garbage advice it is you you are so right basically here's what the truth is find a job that you love and in five years you'll hate it and I'm even even if it wasn't the hours or the stuff for work it's even going back to the wrestler analogy I mean those those wrestlers are probably not seeing their kids a whole lot since they're on the road and with me like I don't get to see Irene a whole lot like she gets off work at 5:00 I start streaming at usually 6:00 and by the time I'm done she's sleeping and it's just like kind of the sacrifice I've made to create content and the problem with creating content is it's extremely competitive there's no secret that content creator is the number one job that kids want to be and what they write on their little homework sheets when the teacher asks like what do you want to be when you grow up you know it used to be astronaut it used to be I want to be a fire person yeah fire president or astronaut or racecar driver like it is content creator it's youtuber pop whatever my schedule is usually Monday through Friday 6:00 to midnight so that's 30 hours streaming and then on Saturday I only stream for about 4 hours so we're about thirty four hours streaming and then Sunday which is quote-unquote my day off for podcasting it is we record the show which usually takes three to four hours and then it's another three to four hours to edit it and then afterwards it skewing it up for posting you know getting it uploaded getting it ready for YouTube now getting it ready for social media and so my my Sundays are like a full eight hour sometimes 10 hour day and then on top of that now I have to I don't know the word for it is like advertise or get my name out there and making content that people would want to share or enjoy or like or favorite all these buzz words but I've really stepped up my Instagram game besides putting the podcast on YouTube now there's two new YouTube videos that come out on Monday or Wednesday and Friday because the problem is if you slow down on making content you slowly start to become irrelevant and a good analogy of this would be you know something like a Sears or Kmart you know at one point they were very popular household name companies that you know you just say if I need a refrigerator I'm gonna go to Sears if I need pencils for the school year I'm gonna go to Kmart and you know they didn't adapt and evolve another good analogy would like be like Blockbuster and they closed down so it's it's as easy as a content creator to kind of fall in that same path of like if I just continue doing the same old stuff I run the risk of becoming irrelevant or having other content creators take take that spot and it's just how it is so that's probably why the podcast has like slightly changed over the years in a way oh we've changed a lot over these trusts I've been here for a front row seat we've changed a lot we've learned a lot it's why I always try new things on this twitch stream it's why I am now you know doing stuff outside of that and at the end of the day I going back to my dad's like why don't you just get a traditional job which is probably the easy answer of like I could easily make more money once I get work off work at 5:00 p.m. I'm done I don't have to worry about you know did this tweet get enough retweets did this Instagram post get enough likes I don't wouldn't have to worry about that at the end of the day I just like doing this I like being a constant in people's life like there's nothing more exciting than waking up on Monday and seeing people say positive things about the episode if they've already listened to it there's nothing like hitting go live on Monday evening and having people tell me about their weekends and just like reading all these comments this week whether it was on YouTube or slack or reddit or Twitter or whatever is is like worth it enough for me to have these really long work weeks time and time again to answer your question I don't have a day off effort that's not true your you you take vacations and then Greg and I go in and examine the Malheur yep that's yeah that's true that you have we are there to help like take your vacations like it is important like I wanna stress for people who the mental health and well-being of your favorite streamer is affected by their non-stop workload so be aware that when they take a vacation like it is vital for them to continue making content for you to enjoy and not slowly descend into very dark places as a lot of content creators have it's a hard line it's a hard job and they do need those times off you guys want to take a question here I'll ask from Layton hey s PJ and the rest of the podcast family is running if we didn't currently have DLC coming for a third pillar in the sword shield error would you prefer an enhanced game like emerald and platinum or a sequel like black 2 and white 2 sequel enhanced I loved flatten em I loved emerald I liked the enhanced versions more than the sequels but Steve pack ah yeah I would probably say sequel I I enjoyed black to white to a lot marketing I think black to white to still gives you a reason to buy black and white I feel like if you skipped black diamond and pearl you bought platinum boy there's not a lot of reasons to go back to diamond and pearl unless you see that learning bar I do not care about the profits another company I care about my enjoyment with the product yeah I guess I would never tell somebody to buy Sun and Moon at this point because I just think ultra Sun alternate a better product very true i well I still tell be able to buy sudden moon because I think the story is more complex than Sun and Moon yeah and playing both like I think to get more out of the story of ultrasound ultramoon it's important to a played sun and moon so you can see the differences and see how how what they're doing differs like i think of all the ones I've done like send a moon has a much better story and having plates on the moon made ultra Sun and Ultra suit moans decisions make a little bit more sense like ultrasound ultra moon alone the story is a lot weaker if you hadn't played some intimate I don't disagree I just think the the amount of game you get an ultrasound on ultra moon is is significantly do you get you get a lot more game that is true just one thing that I I mean the kind of draws me to a sequel and like I wish that they could expand on more that I can't think of a lot of games that have done this but they did for black 2 and white 2 was they had that thing where you could transfer over some of your experiences and then as you went through the story it was like remember when this previous trainer came through and did this this and this and it was like memories of what things you had done but that was amazing it's like so simple such a little thing such a little touch but boy oh boy did it add so much meaning to those games yeah I mean if ultra seminal Furman had done that I probably would be on the sequel's more but like they did it from black and white to and then dropped it like a hot potato which like it does that's what doesn't sell me on sequels like even Ultra sudden Ultraman weren't really sequels they were certainly weren't yeah yeah they were they were just playing them they just figured it out they could sell two copies instead of one yeah so like if they were actually to put out a true true true sequel then I would probably be interested in that to finish their comment they would personally like a sequel this time we were offered a Jodo starter and only sudoku matters as well a circular again one been listening since I was playing heartgold it's crazy things that I'm still here listening to you boyos anyways happy 400 episodes why is that there's nothing crazy about that we good we do this in two [Laughter] so this is a question from grant hi I've been listening to your podcast for a while I'm on the younger side yet I still find it really awesome and entertaining I love your podcast so much my question is would you SHINee unlock za za za magenta Eternity and starters or keep them locked Thanks have an awesome day there were a lot of ease and awesome bye sure I just couldn't pronounce oh no I would keep them locked as well yeah I I agree I what what's nice about SHINee locking those particular Pokemon in the games is it in the future they can then do a distribution and everybody can get them as SHINee and then your whole soft reseting drama and everything is just for nature yeah and I mean people hate getting I don't know why there's a group of people that hate getting free shinies a bit although I would argue walking in the game stuff is much more difficult than a stressful situation right there I think the deeper I think the deeper reason I don't know if we've don't know I've said I talked about Pokemon too much I don't know if I've ever said this in the podcast or this is specifically a twitch stream thing but I don't think it was any secret I don't think it was an accident that in Sun and Moon those starter resets were like five minutes each right I don't think like anyone at the Pokemon company or anyone at Game Freak making the games were like Oh Jo she wouldn't we add a there's no Japanese person named Jo shouldn't we add a recess there is or a save right before the person picked up the starter like the the amount of ease they could have made that happen and they chose not to I think you're well aware they've been well aware since black and white that were prior to black and white that people want to reset for these things and they don't want those people to probably because my assumption is they want those people to play through the game and not worry about that and if you have somebody I I can think of for people on twitch that when sword and shield came out they were still softer setting for either Papa Leo Litton or Rowlett in one of their copies of Sun and Moon and I just don't think that's a good way to experience the game and I get it you paid the $40 experienced the game and how you want to experience it but if somebody's not getting to the end of black and white because they're still trying to soft reset for zekrom like they they might not ever see the ending to that game so I think it was smart although controversial to lock these Pokemon but at the same time I don't and I've always said this I don't think turning on and off your video game over and over is a great way to play a video game I just think I like it because it did encourage everybody to get into the game pretty quickly like I did do a little software setting for nature's not a lot because I knew mints were coming on now so that they just don't really matter when you're playing through the game they only really matter for competitive truly they can get through the game by over leveling so I think I like it because it encourages people to just just start playing the game get get into the content like don't worry about this don't waste fifty hours before you actually get to play the game especially when you hat you know we're in the era of content creation from these games and I'm sure they want people to be like don't have your content be 50 hours of software setting when our game immediately comes out just please start playing the game yeah and I think there is I don't know even though the people complain that like oh sigh guard was it zegart yeah it was Uyghur that was shiny locked and then they gave it as a game stop distribution for the year of legendary whether or not it's shiny I think is pretty irrelevant because the distributions are a time and place kind of thing and and we've learned with Maher shadow and we've learned with volcanion and we've learned with meloetta if you weren't or or panzer aura these Pokemon are incredibly rare now and they should be I mean they should be rare their mythical but they're rare because you had a full month which is a long time to walk into a Game Stop and get these and a lot of people didn't mm-hmm the same for zygarde that you had a month to get shiny zygarde and if you missed it you missed it some people don't care if they wanted to sit there and turn off their video game over and over and that's if that's how you enjoy a game that's cool I mean I've done it I've definitely turned off my switch 7,000 times for shiny Articuno and I can't say that at any point of that that was fun but I got a shiny Articuno at the end of it and I put it into the box and I don't think I've looked at it since but mission accomplished I guess I think of anything they have they have definitely leaned into Chinese mm-hmm and I don't think they have a good way for us to hunt like legendary shinies at this point so by locking it I guess they're at least letting people play the other parts of the game and not turn off and on their game yeah I don't I don't know what the I don't know what the future is for that I don't know how they they fix that or or get people to say like okay you can in this super ultimate pokemon sword in 15 years when we replay through it again you'll be able to hunt za Shion but it will be this way and not turn on an off your video game over and over I don't know what that looks like though I'm not a video game I don't have to be creative I'm not a video game creator not with that attitude Louis from our slack community asks will there be another top 10 Pokemon debate episode in the future oh my stomach he can't handle it I was so hungry at the end of that what was that like a five-hour recording that we ended up getting like three hours it was supposed to be like 30 minutes they'll throw away fun thing to do it was like 5 hours long and I was so hungry you know if I'd been there have been even longer yup so let's do another 180 hours yeah I mean we can do another one uh I don't know what that would entail I think the problem is like there's so many Pokemon right and it's so hard to like weigh the opinions that would have to be like top 10 water pokemon or something like it where you would have to like cut it down dramatically I feel like top 10 water pokemon that our fish only okay all right Goldie number one number two bass : breakfast yeah I mean like I think they're I think there's an importance to have episodes that are not news focused although obviously there's a lot of Pokemon news that comes out so it's it's easy to keep doing a weekly show but I I think at a point in time that was a really good it was a really good episode to point people towards if they were unsure of where to start yeah but now I feel like that episode is very outdated oh yeah it is yeah this I still lived in DC remember those days what waiting for that excuse me taxes still has my card great you have a question from Kevin what has your favorite episode of is EEB in this is that Tuffy a hat is its go completely out of my memory the minute I walk away from you mind if I own like as a listener I mean I will put up this since we talked about the top 10 Pokemon debate was a joy to listen to even though I hated all of you for picking wrong and you did pick wrong so don't even try to defend your choices I still can't believe a Steve in his hole what was that product helix fossile he asked oh that he so easily forgot it was so important to him at that time sure what I didn't forget I just didn't buy that argument sure nightmare fuel that one if anything I'm still mad that Micah's Pokemon made the list so much it's like no one challenged it it was just like I like Gengar because it was the ghost Pokemon I caught and red and blue and everyone was like god this is good enough I mean who doesn't like Gengar huh a special game guy right now I think there's a lot of moments like the web zip moment is still up there I think that's very very funny it's hard to pick an episode because like a lot of the episode of news focuses like well that was just the news that time contrary to popular belief I've always liked listening to the live episodes that recorded at the paksas I think those were all very fun I know people don't like live episodes but I always enjoined them because I think the interactions with the fans and like little kids asking questions were always charming not a one particular episode cuz they've just been to many one but I think when we did years ago the what was it not patreon but the other one the fundraiser kickstart the Kickstarter and we have everybody all the guests come on and they would like we talked to everybody I really enjoyed those because we just had so many different people different perspectives and everything like that that that I enjoyed doing all of those and then Greg and I got into a fight yeah we did cuz you're wrong whatever Hey and we continue it to this day you this day so yeah I think those were probably among my favorites I mean I also you know started doing this with Justin and I enjoyed like a lot of doing all of the episodes with him because Justin is always so excited about things in a way that I don't get excited ever so that I think I'll always hold that fun a fond memories of that Rachelle goes what's the best / most useful life lesson you've learned from your experiences with Pokemon hmm I've learned that people on Instagram are consistently wrong I don't know why it's specifically Instagram but man no I have a serious answer well you can go though I was going to say that I remember like when we first met up at US Nationals in 2012 and I didn't know anything about Eevee training or meta or anything for VG C's but I had my team and my life lesson was to just enjoy yourself because even if you've got a bad team you're there to have fun I don't know this is tough best most useful I think you know all of my years of dealing with Pokemon not just this podcast but and everything I think one of the best things that pokemon has been able to capture that doesn't exist in a lot of other fandoms is a very strong sense of community the fact that there's a strong working together trading and a focus on sort of friendly competitive that I think Pokemon more than anything introduces you to similar people who like things like you that mostly free from toxicity mostly I mean there's still some some darker aspects I think that the hold exit thing brought out some very dark things but I think in general community the community that Pokemon builds naturally through its gameplay is is one of the best things that I've gotten out of Pokemon I've made a lot of friends through the game I've made a lot of connections to the game that just weren't there before it's easy to bond over this I think Pokemon go really helped reinforce that it's easy to bond over Pokemon go as well like you can talk about these things as a shared experience and I would say more than a lot of other fandoms I've made a lot of great connections through Pokemon as a game as a fandom when I started the podcasts I was an idiot and not an idiot just a neophyte and I've definitely grown over the years it's funny because I was I found an old Trello board the other day and it was probably around the time before we'll was active on the podcast I would say yeah I don't remember ever using Trello so yeah and there was there was maybe like 20 people that was part of it and it was there's a bunch of people that wanted to somehow help out with the show whether that was writing or just helping with future episode concepts or whatnot I don't even remember how it got started but I just like read some of the things like the priorities I had and they were so they're just like wrong there was just like creating content and like reading them like this was a priority for me at the time was just like oh this is why none of this was successful back in the day I mean weren't you like 22 yeah yeah I wasn't goodness I've been it would have been 20 I think I would have been 21 when I started actually I mean so more than the two of us like the the years between 20 and 21 and 21 and 20 like there's a lot of just growth that adults go through then so I think like I also listened at very beginning and you are a very different person then when you started but you're also you and like like everybody does you had a lot of growth ending like in your 20s you were exposed to a lot more things and I will say to your credit I know a lot of people who are exposed to a big wide world who constantly knocks you down who become more obstinate and more awful and you didn't do that you have very much grown as a person and accepted everything that came your way and are willing to mostly except when you're wrong mostly and adapt to become a better person I think over this time period I think everybody can see that you have changed and improved yourself and improved your outlook which does not happen to a lot of people so if nothing else like it's easy to look back at our old cells and be like I can't believe that - it was oh that was 100% me a lot of people don't do that a lot of people can look at their past self and say well I'm the same and I think you you should be proud of who you've become through a lot of stuff that the world has thrown at you and still produce a lot of things that people enjoy and I think you should be proud of that yeah and I will say right that one thing just over the almost 10 years now that this podcast has existed is that and and you know this is like one of the core things that I always hold from my all for my own life right it's you know constant progress yeah I never I'm never gonna be perfect but I'm constantly progressing constantly improving and if you really just look over the amount of time that this is the podcast has been coming out it's just always progressing to become a better more professional you know even trying new things it's like if the new things don't work out you know quietly retiring them but just always moving towards a more professional and keeping you know eyes on constant improvement and making sure that the podcasts as a product is something that people are continuing to enjoy and continues to have value for the community where there's a lot of people and even people who have been doing podcasts for a decade or more where their podcast has literally not changed since day one yep I think that that's just like a huge testament to the amount of work that you know that Steve puts in to you know keeping his ears to the ground listening to what people want listening to what people have to say and listening to me and Greg - and others obviously because there's been many other people involved over time and saying you know like you know it is this something we should try is this something we shouldn't try why should we why shouldn't we should be discussed these topics in what way how do we bring this up do we just not bring this up and you know that that's a level of professionalism that probably I have to say like out ways like the amount of professionalism that's put into the recording of this program outweighs the monetary that you get back as compared to other programs that are on the same professional level does that make any sense that do those words in that order mostly okay thank you I mean there's no ads there used to be ads we did ads for Sox at one point we did do ads for a Sox at one point I am sure there's probably a path where I had could have made more click baby stuff even now on YouTube or whatnot and grow that audience quicker but I would rather take the slow route and just continue to be genuine and provide the most accurate information and we've gotten things wrong on the show before but I I still stand by like old me probably was trying to get numbers to grow quicker and new me doesn't like new me is too focused on the show being genuine the next question will surprise you though hey you won't believe the next question well we'll end on this question here Brandon says what is your favorite ISE memory that is not Pokemon related Gen Con 20s 2016 when I actually decided to drive across states to finally meet everybody like I had talked to you for Oh cuz we've been doing mythical and I still hadn't met anybody in person and I'd never done Gen Con and I was traveling by myself and I was gonna compete complete strangers I like this is this is such a bad idea but at least I'm at a convention so if I hate the mix it was great like it was a lot of fun like I had a better time that I was expecting I would probably say like what comes to mind first is there was one time and I don't even remember why I was visiting you and may have been visiting you for your birthday but I don't even remember if that was why and Jeff Dean came and we picked him up at the bus station okay then we like stayed up like completely overnight until like 6 o'clock the next morning playing board games I do remember this that was a lot of fun I don't know if we were talked about this but there was a I think it was 2016 where I got in contact with a lot of people who have done something with the show Greg will Logan Travis and we rented a house in the Wisconsin Dells I was there you were there and I think there was there was like 13 of us 14 of us yeah yeah and the Wisconsin Dells are in the middle of Wisconsin they're like an hour north of Madison Madison is like an hour west of Milwaukee it's like maybe three hours east of the Twin Cities three and a half three and a half and I Drive a lot they there's different hotel accommodations at the Wisconsin Dells and we ended up going to the Kalahari and they had this was this would have been December early December I think because the first week of December yeah cuz Sun and Moon were out they were out for almost a month and we rented a whole house and it had I think five or six bedrooms there was one in the basement there was hue on the main floor and then two on the top floor maybe three on the top floor and I have like two beds and Travis flew in and Logan flew in and then there was like and anyone from it and we'll flew in so there was like four cars that left Milwaukee with different people in it and different luggage and I think two cars left Minnesota yep and then we it could have easily been one but it didn't know those people yeah and there was the like 13 14 of us that we were at the cabin or like three or four days and it was it was fantastic it was like pee it was because of Iasi but it had nothing to do with the podcast and stuff and I do think we recorded some mythical there we did if we were to ever do it again which I don't know if that would be ever be possible just having all all those people to am playing checkbox to am playing TKO which I which my I did my best shirt is from that Gao the TKO shirts from those shirts that I mean I can't believe was up at 2 a.m. but but I think like 14 people renting the cabin came to like it was like $50 a night for a person it was like incredibly bad and everyone walked out spending like less than $200 and it's always why now like it's so hard for me to put GenCon on the list of things I want to do cuz Gen Con is like minimum $1,000 your numbers are way while for that but anyways no it's not Hotel minimum 199 yeah no the hotel is super expensive yeah but you don't share well that's that's true he does not share so like of the of the conventions I went to last year or some with you Jen kinda was my cheapest pax is significantly expensive alright yeah it's while yeah pax is real expensive but yeah I would love to do something like that again with more people I remember being very very worried about the initial however my however well the dynamics of having all those people in the house but also like the the price of the credit card to rent a house for yes three days although when you break it down into like 14 different people it it comes out to pennies but somebody has to pay that costs up front but yeah that was uh that's a really good weekend and I remember it was a lot of people playing board games or playing games the TV or just sitting around playing Sun and Moon and there was a complete indoor water park and amusement park and tons of restaurants and it was it was a super good weekend yeah I heard the mac and cheese restaurant the restaurant one and the hamburger restaurant where we went back to you for Heatran no Heatran was bachelor party we went back hello I see I see I see and y'all force us to go to Pizza Ranch which is unseal to this day unforgivable with four look yeah you do Pizza Ranch once and then you just never have to go back again the first time you'll a problem so let's captain del learn it out it is there's like no way to go directly to the Del's correct there's no like airport there but if you want a cheap trip the first week of December Wisconsin Dells offseason Wisconsin December January at the Dells heck yeah just not Christmas Christmas at the Dells is expensive that's our episode that's episode 400 boo he told me I wrote a Pokemon of the week for no reason yeah you gotta save it I did my song up front sorry if we did not get to your
