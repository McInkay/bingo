I was cheating in Pokémon go this week (0:28 - 0:33)
but I may have discovered something on (0:30 - 0:38)
accident oh ho ho it is time for True (0:33 - 0:42)
Confessions new segment what games are (0:38 - 0:45)
we cheating in this week finally it&#39;s (0:42 - 0:48)
come around to Hannah cheater (0:45 - 0:50)
extraordinaire lot a lot of cheating on (0:48 - 0:53)
this podcast recently I haven&#39;t cheated (0:50 - 0:55)
on (0:53 - 0:55)
anything perfect well (0:56 - 1:05)
it&#39;s it&#39;s another episode uh with you (1:01 - 1:07)
know the planning of there couldn&#39;t (1:05 - 1:11)
possibly be more Pokemon sleep news this (1:07 - 1:14)
week but man those developers love to (1:11 - 1:16)
communicate which is a good (1:14 - 1:21)
thing we have some Pokemon sleep news we (1:16 - 1:23)
have finally a little bit of news about (1:21 - 1:28)
Pokemon pocket which is the (1:23 - 1:33)
TCG dual Yu-Gi-Oh dual links app that is (1:28 - 1:35)
eventually supposed to come I think they (1:33 - 1:37)
said this I&#39;m almost positive they said (1:35 - 1:40)
this year they just didn&#39;t say when yeah (1:37 - 1:44)
this year um and then we have some (1:40 - 1:48)
Pokemon go news and uh we have some (1:44 - 1:50)
James Turner news which if you don&#39;t (1:48 - 1:52)
know who James Turner is we will talk (1:50 - 1:55)
about that when we we get there which is (1:52 - 1:57)
probably some of the more more exciting (1:55 - 2:00)
news we&#39;ve we&#39;ve gotten recently but no (1:57 - 2:03)
nothing is more exciting than Pokemon (2:00 - 2:05)
sleep one of the most complicated (2:03 - 2:07)
Pokemon games ever (2:05 - 2:09)
made (2:07 - 2:13)
and and ente is is on its way here and (2:09 - 2:17)
they did do the event outline for (2:13 - 2:20)
ente again if you&#39;re not playing Pokemon (2:17 - 2:23)
sleep yet but you&#39;ve maybe played (2:20 - 2:25)
Pokemon go just imagine if Niantic was (2:23 - 2:27)
good at communication that&#39;s what (2:25 - 2:30)
Pokemon sleep is just we&#39;re going to (2:27 - 2:32)
tell you everything that&#39;s going to (2:30 - 2:35)
happen we&#39;re setting your (2:32 - 2:38)
expectations you I mean this is year one (2:35 - 2:40)
we&#39;ll see how communicative they are in (2:38 - 2:41)
year two when they get tired of doing (2:40 - 2:43)
this they want to move on with their (2:41 - 2:46)
life well I think select button is a (2:43 - 2:48)
Japanese (2:46 - 2:52)
developer and Niantic is a American (2:48 - 2:54)
developer so maybe that has something to (2:52 - 2:55)
do with (2:54 - 2:58)
it all right ente is going to show up uh (2:55 - 3:00)
it&#39;s a two we long event this is exactly (2:58 - 3:02)
like like raicho there are some changes (3:00 - 3:04)
here some are the same though um in (3:02 - 3:07)
you&#39;re going to be collecting ente main (3:04 - 3:09)
to exchange for items such as an ente (3:07 - 3:12)
incense and ente biscuits uh also during (3:09 - 3:14)
this event there will be limited time (3:12 - 3:16)
missions for both week one and week two (3:14 - 3:19)
each one will earn you ente (3:16 - 3:21)
main uh the area that you will be able (3:19 - 3:25)
to get ente will be green grass I think (3:21 - 3:27)
there was some speculation of like maybe (3:25 - 3:29)
Green Grass and topalo it&#39;s just green (3:27 - 3:32)
grass so you&#39;re stuck to going to green (3:29 - 3:35)
grass for two weeks here unless you (3:32 - 3:37)
don&#39;t care about anti at all then like (3:35 - 3:39)
live your best life and you know hit up (3:37 - 3:40)
lapis I (3:39 - 3:45)
guess but that will start on Monday the (3:40 - 3:48)
20th and then run until June (3:45 - 3:50)
[Music] (3:48 - 3:55)
3 and uh each time a fire type help (3:50 - 3:58)
helper Pokemon brings you ingredients (3:55 - 4:00)
during this event it will bring you one (3:58 - 4:04)
extra the chance of fire type Pokemon (4:00 - 4:07)
and fire type helper Pokemon&#39;s main (4:04 - 4:11)
skills will be multiplied by 1.5 Snorlax (4:07 - 4:13)
on green grass will have a locked in (4:11 - 4:16)
Lepa Berry uh which is the one that fire (4:13 - 4:19)
type Pokemon use this is the same as the (4:16 - 4:23)
electric Berry grea I think it was for (4:19 - 4:26)
REO grea (4:23 - 4:28)
um a few Pokemon of different sleep (4:26 - 4:31)
types will appear regard regardless of (4:28 - 4:33)
what sleep type you have for the night (4:31 - 4:35)
certain type of Pokemon will more likely (4:33 - 4:39)
appear this is the big change here so (4:35 - 4:42)
week one your fire type helper Pokemon (4:39 - 4:45)
will be boosted by one your M the main (4:42 - 4:47)
skill level of your fire type Pokemon (4:45 - 4:49)
will be boosted by one and then week two (4:47 - 4:51)
the main skill of your fire type Pokemon (4:49 - 4:55)
will be boosted by three and then the (4:51 - 4:58)
second Sunday of the event your drowsy (4:55 - 5:01)
power will be multiplied by 1.5 what (4:58 - 5:05)
does the main skill level mean uh well (5:01 - 5:08)
the main skill level is for I&#39;ll I&#39;ll (5:05 - 5:09)
use Charizard as an example that&#39;s the (5:08 - 5:11)
easiest one Charizard&#39;s main skill is (5:09 - 5:13)
ingredient magnet which means when you (5:11 - 5:16)
proc and you click on it and it procs (5:13 - 5:19)
you it goes like ah here&#39;s more sausage (5:16 - 5:22)
because Charizard&#39;s a sausage machine um (5:19 - 5:24)
when you level up your so when you catch (5:22 - 5:25)
a Charmander your main skill would be (5:24 - 5:27)
level one when you evolve it to a charm (5:25 - 5:29)
Charmeleon the main skill would be level (5:27 - 5:31)
two cuz any time you evolve a Pokemon (5:29 - 5:33)
the main skill goes up obviously (5:31 - 5:34)
Charizard would be (5:33 - 5:37)
three if you had like one of those gold (5:34 - 5:39)
main skill seeds you could manually (5:37 - 5:42)
increase it uh but what it&#39;s saying is (5:39 - 5:44)
on week two your Charizard will have a (5:42 - 5:48)
main skill of level six which is (5:44 - 5:51)
crazy um it&#39;s only temporary and it&#39;s (5:48 - 5:53)
only for fire type Pokemon so you know (5:51 - 5:56)
if you have a tyion that main skill will (5:53 - 5:59)
be level six if you have a nine tails (5:56 - 6:01)
that main skill would be level (5:59 - 6:05)
five uh and that will last all week for (6:01 - 6:09)
raicho they did week two you would start (6:05 - 6:11)
at Ultra 4 for everyone which was like (6:09 - 6:14)
cool but that&#39;s not happening this time (6:11 - 6:17)
it&#39;s this main skill (6:14 - 6:17)
stuff a little bit bummed that it (6:18 - 6:23)
doesn&#39;t it means you won&#39;t be able to (6:21 - 6:25)
boost your D&#39;s main skill with that (6:23 - 6:27)
because that would be (6:25 - 6:30)
fun yeah main skill to den (6:27 - 6:32)
fire type (6:30 - 6:35)
only uh my shiny Arcanine (6:32 - 6:38)
already oh you have a shiny you got (6:35 - 6:40)
shiny Growlithe yeah or or Arcanine at (6:38 - 6:42)
some point oh I had shiny Growlithe and (6:40 - 6:45)
I was a shiny Arcanine I realized why I (6:42 - 6:48)
didn&#39;t put my sh my icon as shiny (6:45 - 6:51)
Geodude because I caught it as a shiny (6:48 - 6:55)
graler and that Pokemon&#39;s bad and I (6:51 - 6:57)
would never use it as my icon I was like (6:55 - 6:59)
oh I should do it and we they like why (6:57 - 7:01)
don&#39;t I have by shiny Geodude that&#39;s (6:59 - 7:03)

game having a Geodude and then every one (7:34 - 7:41)
of those geodudes having sturdy it&#39;s a (7:37 - 7:44)
great experience although uh I did as (7:41 - 7:47)
I&#39;m now playing through Scarlet did get (7:44 - 7:49)
a shiny geod (7:47 - 7:52)
dude just walking on a mountain I&#39;m like (7:49 - 7:58)
oh hey okay sure welcome your fire type (7:52 - 8:01)
helper Pokemon for the event and just in (7:58 - 8:03)
the game are Charmander Charmeleon (8:01 - 8:06)
Charizard Vulpix and nin tales that will (8:03 - 8:10)
be starting Monday May 6 growth and (8:06 - 8:12)
Arcanine (8:10 - 8:18)
Flareon syndic Quil quava tyan and (8:12 - 8:20)
ente this might (8:18 - 8:23)
be this is the shocking news breaking (8:20 - 8:26)
news shocking news this might be the (8:23 - 8:29)
only time Flareon has ever been good in (8:26 - 8:31)
a Pokemon game (8:29 - 8:33)
[Music] (8:31 - 8:35)
so you&#39;re saying I should evolve one of (8:33 - 8:37)
my many EVS into a Flareon at the start (8:35 - 8:41)
of this uh yes so uh here&#39;s here&#39;s your (8:37 - 8:43)
here&#39;s your more breaking news here&#39;s (8:41 - 8:48)
your Pokemon sleep tip for this (8:43 - 8:52)
event because you&#39;re if you have a good (8:48 - 8:54)
Charizard which hopefully you do for (8:52 - 8:55)
this event because it&#39;s probably out of (8:54 - 8:56)
all of these Charizard is probably going (8:55 - 8:59)
to be the one you definitely want um (8:56 - 9:01)
Charizard is going to get you way more (8:59 - 9:03)
ingredients because its main skill is (9:01 - 9:05)
going to go up during this event which (9:03 - 9:07)
means you will have a lot of ingredients (9:05 - 9:11)
Flareon increases your cooking pot size (9:07 - 9:14)
that&#39;s its ability and that ability will (9:11 - 9:16)
go up so you will get a bigger cooking (9:14 - 9:19)
pot so you&#39;ll want to probably that&#39;s (9:16 - 9:21)
probably like the basic combo you want (9:19 - 9:25)
is a a decent Charmander line if you (9:21 - 9:27)
can&#39;t get it to Charizard still (9:25 - 9:29)
Charmander Charmeleon still good and (9:27 - 9:30)
then a decent play around that&#39;s kind of (9:29 - 9:33)
like the combo you want honestly like (9:30 - 9:34)
arcanine&#39;s probably the worst out of all (9:33 - 9:37)
of them um if you have one you should (9:34 - 9:39)
I&#39;m I&#39;m sorry Greg not to offend your (9:37 - 9:42)
shiny how dare my shiny Arcanine sits (9:39 - 9:45)
there and gets me spicy (9:42 - 9:48)
leaves and I love him another tip if (9:45 - 9:51)
you&#39;re if you&#39;re a syndic Quil lover uh (9:48 - 9:54)
any syndic Quil with berry finding small (9:51 - 9:57)
either in the level 10 or the level 25 (9:54 - 9:59)
is going to be fantastic super super (9:57 - 10:01)
good but that doesn&#39;t like combo with (9:59 - 10:03)
the other two I just mentioned and then (10:01 - 10:07)
like we really don&#39;t know how good (10:03 - 10:12)
Ninetales is uh it seems okay it doesn&#39;t (10:07 - 10:15)
seem like a bad Pokemon it doesn&#39;t it (10:12 - 10:18)
seems (10:15 - 10:20)
fine we know more about it this week (10:18 - 10:23)
than we did last week yeah it will have (10:20 - 10:28)
the energy charge small ability or main (10:23 - 10:30)
skill and that means it will randomly (10:28 - 10:33)
pick a Pokemon to give energy to which (10:30 - 10:38)
anytime it&#39;s like random that&#39;s not the (10:33 - 10:40)
best but I think they slightly tweaked (10:38 - 10:44)
it where the random is more likely to go (10:40 - 10:49)
to a Pokemon that would need it MH um so (10:44 - 10:51)
yeah I I actually (10:49 - 10:53)
think you should definitely probably get (10:51 - 10:58)
a Flareon before this event um if you&#39;re (10:53 - 11:01)
of for Flareon you&#39;re probably looking (10:58 - 11:04)
for you&#39;re looking for an Eevee with (11:01 - 11:11)
maybe uh skill Trigger or um skill level (11:04 - 11:13)
up is probably like the two things (11:11 - 11:16)
you&#39;re looking for uh helping speed also (11:13 - 11:18)
pretty good on Flareon you really don&#39;t (11:16 - 11:21)
need like ingredient finder inventory (11:18 - 11:24)
that&#39;s not bad it&#39;s just like flare (11:21 - 11:28)
and&#39;s main job is to increase your pot (11:24 - 11:28)
size but but yeah I (11:28 - 11:33)
think I think even if you have a (11:31 - 11:37)
mediocre Eevee into Flareon still going (11:33 - 11:41)
to be useful because of the main skill (11:37 - 11:43)
level up bonus that you will get for (11:41 - 11:44)
this (11:43 - 11:48)
event um so that&#39;s maybe my maybe maybe (11:44 - 11:50)
look out for (11:48 - 11:52)
uh an (11:50 - 11:55)
Eevee before before this event starts I (11:52 - 11:57)
have so many of them well pick one Greg (11:55 - 12:01)
pick one yeah I haven&#39;t because Flareon (11:57 - 12:03)
is always bad so I&#39;ve never done it now (12:01 - 12:06)
you&#39;re telling me do the do the one that (12:03 - 12:08)
I never (12:06 - 12:11)
do at least you know I would have had an (12:08 - 12:13)
amazing Flareon but I was like I&#39;ll give (12:11 - 12:15)
Leafeon a chance not knowing that (12:13 - 12:18)
Leafeon was going to be one of the worst (12:15 - 12:20)
yeah as long as this Eevee doesn&#39;t have (12:18 - 12:24)
M skill down nature you&#39;re probably good (12:20 - 12:26)
yeah I I agree with Hannah you could you (12:24 - 12:29)
could be pretty pretty lenient on your (12:26 - 12:31)
EV pick (12:29 - 12:31)
here uh they said they (12:32 - 12:39)
are um changing the store a little bit I (12:36 - 12:40)
think they they Ed the words were (12:39 - 12:43)
balancing the (12:40 - 12:46)
store I&#39;m not sure what was tooo (12:43 - 12:48)
expensive or too cheap but they didn&#39;t (12:46 - 12:51)
exactly say uh there will (12:48 - 12:57)
be uh a gift for people with no friends (12:51 - 13:00)
so if you have no friends on your list (12:57 - 13:04)
you will receive 70 ente Mains uh for (13:00 - 13:06)
the first week and again for the second (13:04 - 13:11)
week wow I will I I know I know the (13:06 - 13:13)
gears are already turning in people&#39;s (13:11 - 13:15)
heads of like should I delete all my (13:13 - 13:18)
friends to get this gift yeah do not do (13:15 - 13:20)
that no well you got lucky with all of (13:18 - 13:23)
the with all of the raicho M I feel like (13:20 - 13:27)
I maybe didn&#39;t get as much I&#39;m not sure (13:23 - 13:28)
I got (13:27 - 13:30)
75 I think (13:28 - 13:32)
when I went into the raicho event 40 of (13:30 - 13:35)
my 50 people were five stars for five (13:32 - 13:38)
hearts or whatever they were Max so when (13:35 - 13:41)
you are Max with somebody you were more (13:38 - 13:42)
likely to get raicho (13:41 - 13:45)
main but also you&#39;re getting like 50 (13:42 - 13:48)
free candy a day if you have 50 people (13:45 - 13:50)
on your friends (13:48 - 13:53)
list so I don&#39;t think the trade-off of (13:50 - 13:56)
like let me delete everyone to get like (13:53 - 13:58)
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s don&#39;t do that (13:56 - 14:00)
having a full (13:58 - 14:03)
having a full friends list is still (14:00 - 14:06)
significantly better don&#39;t do (14:03 - 14:10)
that don&#39;t delete your (14:06 - 14:11)
friends (14:10 - 14:15)
uh ente incense will work the same (14:11 - 14:18)
guarantees you an encounter with ente (14:15 - 14:21)
you can only hold one at a time um ente (14:18 - 14:23)
biscuits will work the same as raicho (14:21 - 14:25)
and ente biscuit will be six after the (14:23 - 14:28)
event ends it will be turned into great (14:25 - 14:30)
biscuits um the event exchange will (14:28 - 14:33)
still have ente incense ente biscuits it (14:30 - 14:36)
will have a firestone which you&#39;ll need (14:33 - 14:39)
for Flareon if you don&#39;t already have (14:36 - 14:41)
one you can still I believe go into the (14:39 - 14:43)
store and get one I think it&#39;s like (14:41 - 14:47)
1,400 points um and then you&#39;ll need and (14:43 - 14:49)
then the main skill seed I will stress (14:47 - 14:52)
this the best item in this entire shop (14:49 - 14:55)
is the main skill seed it it is by far (14:52 - 14:57)
the best thing in the game you should (14:55 - 15:00)
buy so (14:57 - 15:02)
get your ente and then prioritize your (15:00 - 15:04)
main skill seed over in my opinion over (15:02 - 15:06)
a second (15:04 - 15:11)
ente uh I don&#39;t know anyone who got a (15:06 - 15:13)
second raicho that was better than the (15:11 - 15:17)
first REO I&#39;m sure someone did somebody (15:13 - 15:20)
did CH someone (15:17 - 15:23)
did I have like four main skill (15:20 - 15:25)
seeds I don&#39;t know what to do with them (15:23 - 15:28)
save them for rals if if you got a good (15:25 - 15:30)
rals I don&#39;t have a good Ral I only have (15:28 - 15:33)
one ralt yeah I know I don&#39;t have saving (15:30 - 15:34)
it for shiny things and then I&#39;m like it (15:33 - 15:38)
has to be a special shiny thing and thus (15:34 - 15:40)
thus like master balls they sit and I&#39;m (15:38 - 15:42)
like I&#39;ll wait for the right moment to (15:40 - 15:46)
use it and that never happens I think um (15:42 - 15:48)
I mean if if you don&#39;t have look look (15:46 - 15:51)
I&#39;ve had lapis unlocked for Two Plus (15:48 - 15:52)
months I still don&#39;t even have a good (15:51 - 15:54)
routes and there&#39;s probably people who (15:52 - 15:57)
don&#39;t have lapis unlocked at all so uh (15:54 - 15:59)
if you have like a good Wiggly tough uh (15:57 - 16:01)
that&#39;s good for that or a good Sylveon (15:59 - 16:04)
those are the two energy for everyone&#39;s (16:01 - 16:06)
before you get to rals and it might be a (16:04 - 16:08)
while before you get to rals and then it (16:06 - 16:09)
might be another while before you get a (16:08 - 16:12)
good rals so um I think those are good (16:09 - 16:14)
and I think Blastoise Charizard Venusaur (16:12 - 16:16)
are good for main uh main skill seeds (16:14 - 16:17)
because they&#39;re some of the best (16:16 - 16:20)
ingredient mons but in this (16:17 - 16:24)
case um your your the Boost cannot go (16:20 - 16:27)
past what exists so if you have a (16:24 - 16:31)
Charizard at Main skill level three it&#39;s (16:27 - 16:33)
going to go to Six for this event if (16:31 - 16:37)
it&#39;s already at like five it caps at six (16:33 - 16:40)
so maybe I would if if this didn&#39;t exist (16:37 - 16:41)
I would have maybe been like oh use your (16:40 - 16:44)
main skill on Charizard for this event (16:41 - 16:46)
but we&#39;re getting it free this week so (16:44 - 16:49)
you can kind of hold off on on using (16:46 - 16:53)
it um yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s the whole ente (16:49 - 16:57)
event uh seems Seems good I I don&#39;t have (16:53 - 17:01)
any no notes seems great besides the (16:57 - 17:03)
fact that it&#39;s only on green grass (17:01 - 17:06)
yeah yeah yeah I (17:03 - 17:10)
mean yeah where are you guys going for (17:06 - 17:12)
fire type week which starts tomorrow are (17:10 - 17:14)
you going to go to topalo or are you (17:12 - 17:16)
going to go to green (17:14 - 17:16)
grass I should reassess first but I&#39;m (17:17 - 17:24)
always comfortable staying in topollo (17:20 - 17:27)
yeah I&#39;m in topollo now so I&#39;ll probably (17:24 - 17:30)
just stay there (17:27 - 17:31)
plus then it&#39;s going to be green grass (17:30 - 17:33)
for two weeks yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s (17:31 - 17:35)
literally what I being green grass (17:33 - 17:38)
forever like two two evils do you want (17:35 - 17:40)
green grass for three weeks or do you (17:38 - 17:44)
want Topo is not an evil topollo is (17:40 - 17:47)
good look I&#39;m just trying to find a (17:44 - 17:50)
shiny Sable ey so I can change my icon (17:47 - 17:51)
that is all I want out of this game (17:50 - 17:53)
currently that&#39;s a good goal that&#39;s a (17:51 - 17:53)
good (17:53 - 17:57)
goal I I had to give up on my lapis (17:53 - 18:00)
dreams cuz that place is Mak making me (17:57 - 18:02)
bonkers I&#39;ve switched to topalo for a (18:00 - 18:06)
while we&#39;re sitting over (18:02 - 18:06)
there I just want a good syndic Quil and (18:06 - 18:11)
I can&#39;t I can&#39;t even get a syndic Quil (18:09 - 18:16)
to show up I got a I got a quill lava (18:11 - 18:17)
yesterday I (18:16 - 18:20)
think without its fire it&#39;s just got the (18:17 - 18:22)
little hole red holes in its back like (18:20 - 18:24)
this looks weird when you aren&#39;t on fire (18:22 - 18:26)
you just have little weird red holes on (18:24 - 18:28)
your back and I&#39;m not comfortable with (18:26 - 18:30)
it we&#39;re getting prettyy close to the (18:28 - 18:32)
one-year anniversary of Pokemon sleep (18:30 - 18:34)
and their events have been pretty good (18:32 - 18:35)
so I (18:34 - 18:39)
wonder you know who is also good at um (18:35 - 18:41)
oh maybe this is this is a good segue (18:39 - 18:42)
you know who&#39;s also good at (18:41 - 18:45)
anniversaries Pokemon Masters I will (18:42 - 18:48)
give you to the free reign of the floor (18:45 - 18:51)
to talk about (18:48 - 18:53)
[Laughter] (18:51 - 18:56)
ra I mean I this was not a must get for (18:53 - 18:59)
me but this was a must get for a lot lot (18:56 - 19:02)
of people I was just when I got 3,000 I (18:59 - 19:05)
was just gonna pull and I got it today (19:02 - 19:07)
like hooray it&#39;s Mo mostly because I (19:05 - 19:10)
want them in the kitchen kissing Lodge (19:07 - 19:13)
so that&#39;s mostly the reason why I get (19:10 - 19:17)
most my right now just now (19:13 - 19:21)
kissing well I mean look we all know why (19:17 - 19:24)
we&#39;re there we&#39;re there to make friends (19:21 - 19:25)
although Giovani is still making it (19:24 - 19:27)
weird and I cannot wait to be done with (19:25 - 19:29)
Giovani in my Lodge (19:27 - 19:32)
that dude is weird he makes every (19:29 - 19:33)
interaction (19:32 - 19:35)
weird (19:33 - 19:39)
um wait till they put Cyrus in oh man I (19:35 - 19:43)
why he&#39;s just depressed all the time um (19:39 - 19:46)
raque is good the story Line&#39;s pretty (19:43 - 19:50)
cute um it&#39;s weird that they have that (19:46 - 19:52)
going on and then they have the masked (19:50 - 19:54)
thing happening at the same time the (19:52 - 19:56)
story lines are like really (19:54 - 20:00)
weird I mean I would put Bryce man and r (19:56 - 20:02)
on the same level of fandom I mean (20:00 - 20:08)
everyone loves Bryson man they went so (20:02 - 20:10)
deep for this storyline I&#39;m like I (20:08 - 20:13)
cannot nobody knows who Sabrina&#39;s (20:10 - 20:15)
character is because nobody but like me (20:13 - 20:18)
and four other people went that deep (20:15 - 20:21)
into Poké star Studios to get to her (20:18 - 20:25)
movie Y where she appears it&#39;s (20:21 - 20:27)
like like you could have just done (20:25 - 20:29)
Bryson man but you&#39;re like we have to (20:27 - 20:32)
have two so let&#39;s get the other movie (20:29 - 20:35)
star and then I respect it I think it&#39;s (20:32 - 20:37)
great it&#39;s a deep cut I sat there and (20:35 - 20:40)
I&#39;m like why do I know this character I (20:37 - 20:40)
don&#39;t (20:40 - 20:43)
remember anything about this and I (20:40 - 20:44)
looked it up like all (20:43 - 20:47)
[Music] (20:44 - 20:49)
right but they&#39;ve taken the spotlight (20:47 - 20:50)
away from (20:49 - 20:56)
ra yeah but not movie stars come on Ra&#39;s (20:50 - 21:00)
ra had had a 4 day meet you in the lobby (20:56 - 21:03)
event and nobody else gets that kind of (21:00 - 21:07)
treatment that&#39;s fair Ash did so you&#39;ve (21:03 - 21:09)
heard it here ra and Ash are on the same (21:07 - 21:11)
level same level of popularity I can see (21:09 - 21:13)
that ra and Ash they fighting it out (21:11 - 21:16)
when the event start is good I think (21:13 - 21:18)
it&#39;s a good overall syn pair I think it (21:16 - 21:24)
does a lot um the storyline was fine (21:18 - 21:26)
like it wasn&#39;t anything it their all of (21:24 - 21:28)
their intro story lines where these (21:26 - 21:30)
people are coming are (21:28 - 21:34)
never great it&#39;s just like hey I&#39;m here (21:30 - 21:36)
why do you run things like this I&#39;m good (21:34 - 21:39)
at fighting let&#39;s be friends that&#39;s like (21:36 - 21:42)
how every introduction goes um they&#39;ll (21:39 - 21:47)
they&#39;ll become more interesting later uh (21:42 - 21:51)
also you have it if you&#39;re not getting (21:47 - 21:53)
the final level or the current of this (21:51 - 21:55)
mystery (21:53 - 21:57)
sinkstone storyline is because you&#39;ve (21:55 - 22:01)
had to found like six 100 mystery Stones (21:57 - 22:02)
if you haven&#39;t found it it doesn&#39;t (22:01 - 22:04)
unlock for (22:02 - 22:07)
you which is that story Line&#39;s getting (22:04 - 22:10)
weird too like I have no clue what (22:07 - 22:12)
you&#39;re referring to I just log in and (22:10 - 22:15)
puling pairs yeah yeah that&#39;s you&#39;ll (22:12 - 22:18)
never so the so the there&#39;s a new type (22:15 - 22:21)
of stone that has been landing and it&#39;s (22:18 - 22:25)
tied to Old Hui sort (22:21 - 22:27)
of and so you just find as you play the (22:25 - 22:29)
game you&#39;ll find them random ly and (22:27 - 22:31)
you&#39;ve had to have found 600 to get the (22:29 - 22:34)
next part of the story line which is (22:31 - 22:38)
Volo and Ray having a chat in a forest (22:34 - 22:40)
about (22:38 - 22:45)
things um it&#39;s all (22:40 - 22:45)
very I have no idea where they&#39;re going (22:46 - 22:51)
with this storyline they have officially (22:49 - 22:55)
they have officially made Volo like the (22:51 - 22:59)
next Giovani level villain like that (22:55 - 23:03)
makes is pretty much playing everybody (22:59 - 23:04)
against everybody else right now and (23:03 - 23:08)
like being super sketchy which match but (23:04 - 23:10)
perfect that&#39;s who this character is um (23:08 - 23:12)
but yeah it you have to have you have to (23:10 - 23:14)
be playing the game now and getting (23:12 - 23:18)
those stones to get this storyline which (23:14 - 23:20)
is kind of a change of how they&#39;ve been (23:18 - 23:23)
doing it before um the r battles are (23:20 - 23:25)
good they weren&#39;t (23:23 - 23:28)
particularly tough that I remember but I (23:25 - 23:31)
haven&#39;t done the special ra B battles (23:28 - 23:35)
yet I haven&#39;t done that (23:31 - 23:35)
storyline Masters is so (23:37 - 23:42)
good the r battles are the one thing (23:39 - 23:44)
that is making me consider actually (23:42 - 23:47)
playing the game instead of just logging (23:44 - 23:49)
in to get the characters I want when the (23:47 - 23:55)
r event started uh I had 40 gems (23:49 - 23:58)
left because I think Volo was another (23:55 - 24:01)
recent poll right I I had been trying to (23:58 - 24:05)
get bolo and had used all of my free (24:01 - 24:09)
gems on that from the last six months (24:05 - 24:11)
and then they and then ra showed up and (24:09 - 24:14)
I had 40 gems left and I went oh no well (24:11 - 24:17)
I&#39;m I didn&#39;t pull on Volo because I (24:14 - 24:20)
wasn&#39;t that interested uh I&#39;m saving up (24:17 - 24:24)
for whatever the summer CU we&#39;re heading (24:20 - 24:26)
towards summer/ second anniversary or (24:24 - 24:30)
third no third fourth Giovani (24:26 - 24:33)
finally God hope so (24:30 - 24:36)
someday with his with his tedo that he (24:33 - 24:38)
had in the anim the speedo that he had (24:36 - 24:41)
it&#39;s Speedo Giovani and (24:38 - 24:44)
Persian uh I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re (24:41 - 24:45)
doing so I&#39;m saving up I was like I (24:44 - 24:47)
would pull Rico because I I&#39;d pull Rico (24:45 - 24:49)
when I had 12,000 gems because that (24:47 - 24:51)
brought me down to 9,000 and then I (24:49 - 24:53)
would build back up so now I&#39;m waiting (24:51 - 24:55)
to see what comes up for the anniversary (24:53 - 24:57)
because the anniversary is coming up (24:55 - 24:59)
it&#39;s usually in July it&#39;s usually (24:57 - 25:00)
towards the end of July that Master&#39;s (24:59 - 25:04)
University anniversary is so I want to (25:00 - 25:05)
know what those are going to (25:04 - 25:11)
be um but R is good like if if you like (25:05 - 25:13)
that pair and you&#39;re like I want a good (25:11 - 25:17)
ground pair like pull for ra um did you (25:13 - 25:18)
both (25:17 - 25:22)
get a popup in the store that was a (25:18 - 25:25)
thousand gems for a dollar (25:22 - 25:29)
yeah yep I saw that one the best deal (25:25 - 25:30)
they&#39;ve ever had it&#39;s the best deal (25:29 - 25:32)
they&#39;ve ever did in I did I did give (25:30 - 25:34)
them a dollar for that yeah I I like I (25:32 - 25:37)
even like I thought like I didn&#39;t (25:34 - 25:39)
hesitate to give them the dollar which (25:37 - 25:41)
is maybe bad on my part it was a really (25:39 - 25:44)
good deal for them like a frighteningly (25:41 - 25:47)
good deal for how bad their prices (25:44 - 25:50)
are wait so Hannah have you spent money (25:47 - 25:55)
on this game Hannah I don&#39;t think I have (25:50 - 25:57)
if I did it was years ago I mean it&#39;s (25:55 - 26:00)
been around for a while at point if I (25:57 - 26:02)
have it was a very small amount of money (26:00 - 26:04)
years ago but I did get very close to (26:02 - 26:07)
spending money for R it was I looked at (26:04 - 26:10)
the shop I looked very hard at the shop (26:07 - 26:12)
and then I decided I really really (26:10 - 26:14)
shouldn&#39;t especially because I don&#39;t (26:12 - 26:18)
actively play this game yeah and so I (26:14 - 26:20)
just opened the game every day and used (26:18 - 26:23)
every single free gem I could until I (26:20 - 26:27)
got ra and I now have ra and I&#39;m happy I (26:23 - 26:30)
mean you can scout there are so many you (26:27 - 26:32)
can get free gems in so many ways if (26:30 - 26:34)
you&#39;re willing to put in the time like I (26:32 - 26:36)
have so many gems locked up in the fact (26:34 - 26:39)
that I will not do the sink bear stories (26:36 - 26:40)
because I cannot sit through those (26:39 - 26:42)
dialogue I thought I was maybe going to (26:40 - 26:44)
have to finally start playing the game (26:42 - 26:47)
to get the gems for her yeah I don&#39;t (26:44 - 26:49)
know a dollar is pretty tempting for the (26:47 - 26:50)
dollar was really good that was a good (26:49 - 26:53)
deal I was like yeah I&#39;ll give you it (26:50 - 26:54)
I&#39;ll give you a dollar for probably the (26:53 - 26:55)
best deal you&#39;ve ever done and hopes (26:54 - 26:57)
that it was a big so like my hope is (26:55 - 26:59)
that they&#39;ll see that that was a really (26:57 - 27:00)
good deal and a lot of people went for (26:59 - 27:03)
it so they&#39;ll do it more (27:00 - 27:06)
often yeah Hannah how do you feel about (27:03 - 27:09)
Ra&#39;s (27:06 - 27:13)
voice uh there I saw a little little (27:09 - 27:16)
little debate about her voice I&#39;m not (27:13 - 27:18)
sure heard the one in Masters I I&#39;ve (27:16 - 27:21)
heard her voice in the (27:18 - 27:25)
anime um and I loved that but I&#39;m not (27:21 - 27:27)
sure I actually heard the Masters one (27:25 - 27:29)
that&#39;s what I meant to look up but it&#39;s (27:27 - 27:32)
all muted on my phone yeah yeah yeah (27:29 - 27:35)
yeah I went into settings prior to this (27:32 - 27:37)
event to make sure voices were louder (27:35 - 27:38)
than (27:37 - 27:44)
music um I I like her voice I think I (27:38 - 27:47)
think if you only listen to her voice (27:44 - 27:50)
when it pulls from the like this the (27:47 - 27:52)
sink Paar where she&#39;s like I think she (27:50 - 27:55)
says like hey hey um it&#39;s like really (27:52 - 27:57)
cheerful but then if you listen to her (27:55 - 27:59)
other voices it&#39;s a little more like I (27:57 - 28:02)
don&#39;t know raspy I guess somebody said (27:59 - 28:04)
somebody compared it to Miley Cyrus and (28:02 - 28:07)
when I think of like um no not like not (28:04 - 28:09)
not in the sense of Miley Cyrus&#39;s voice (28:07 - 28:13)
but like Miley Cyrus has a more raspy (28:09 - 28:15)
voice yeah she has a raspier voice I (28:13 - 28:17)
guess I did just go and listen to it and (28:15 - 28:19)
I can kind of see (28:17 - 28:22)
that uh and I I don&#39;t know I guess I (28:19 - 28:24)
guess I didn&#39;t know what voice I had for (28:22 - 28:28)
RA in my head but like a raspier voice (28:24 - 28:30)
does to me make I was like oh yeah that (28:28 - 28:32)
kind of that feels like it fits her but (28:30 - 28:34)
I mean that&#39;s so subjective (28:32 - 28:38)
everyone has different yeah yeah (28:34 - 28:39)
expectations I don&#39;t think I like the (28:38 - 28:42)
Master&#39;s Voice as much as the Japanese (28:39 - 28:44)
voice in in the (28:42 - 28:47)
anime but it&#39;s (28:44 - 28:50)
fine having just listened to it for half (28:47 - 28:52)
a (28:50 - 28:52)
second yeah I saw a lot of a lot a lot (28:54 - 28:58)
of people very excited for R not (28:57 - 29:02)
surprising I I I would wager to guess (28:58 - 29:05)
once they introduce Larry that will be (29:02 - 29:06)
oh (29:05 - 29:10)
man I will spend money to get Larry I&#39;m (29:06 - 29:12)
telling you right now if Larry goes into (29:10 - 29:16)
the lodge 100% was the top package I&#39;m (29:12 - 29:17)
pulling every (29:16 - 29:20)
day (29:17 - 29:22)
um all right well we got the Masters out (29:20 - 29:24)
of the way we got the sleep out of the (29:22 - 29:26)
way let&#39;s take a break uh when we come (29:24 - 29:30)
back we have uh uh some more news so we (29:26 - 29:34)
will be right back and we are back from (29:30 - 29:35)
our (29:34 - 29:39)
break uh we have I an update we have ra (29:35 - 29:42)
update in in our break I went and (29:39 - 29:44)
listened to the full YouTube video of (29:42 - 29:46)
Ra&#39;s voice and my opinion has changed it (29:44 - 29:48)
is amazing and fantastic and I love it (29:46 - 29:52)
and yes yep good happy to have that (29:48 - 29:54)
character probably gonna play that game (29:52 - 29:56)
more now that&#39;s why I kind of suggested (29:54 - 29:59)
maybe go into the menu and listen to (29:56 - 30:01)
more samples because I think it&#39;s I (29:59 - 30:04)
think the initial one is a little (30:01 - 30:08)
deceiving the the hey hey (30:04 - 30:11)
one um yeah she seems real (30:08 - 30:14)
great I&#39;m sure I&#39;m sure she will (30:11 - 30:16)
definitely get a seasonal pair now that (30:14 - 30:19)
she&#39;s here I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve ever (30:16 - 30:21)
done seasonal (30:19 - 30:27)
before the character has been first in (30:21 - 30:27)
no I don&#39;t think so I think once the (30:28 - 30:33)
characters in then they&#39;re eligible for (30:30 - 30:35)
eligible for (30:33 - 30:38)
seasonal uh (30:35 - 30:40)
let&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s not a lot of talk (30:38 - 30:42)
here about the pocket stuff but it is (30:40 - 30:45)
the first bit of pocket news we have um (30:42 - 30:47)
the Pokemon company and (30:45 - 30:49)
DNA DNA also makes Pokemon Masters good (30:47 - 30:52)
transition just woo we&#39;re spot on here (30:49 - 30:55)
smooth uh they announced a new (30:52 - 30:58)
subsidiary company I said that Ro wrong (30:55 - 31:01)
sub subsidiary (30:58 - 31:03)
subsidiary Hannah you&#39;re close (31:01 - 31:08)
subsidiary subsidiary thank you we&#39;re (31:03 - 31:11)
all learning together the company is (31:08 - 31:15)
called Pokemon card D (31:11 - 31:18)
studio and that studio is supposed to (31:15 - 31:21)
help with the development of the Pokemon (31:18 - 31:24)
TCG (31:21 - 31:24)
pocket they&#39;re very into the (31:26 - 31:31)
subsidiaries right now yeah I mean they (31:28 - 31:32)
sure (31:31 - 31:35)
are it is sort of a weird way to (31:32 - 31:37)
organize your teams in your business but (31:35 - 31:38)
I mean it (31:37 - 31:42)
works it makes the funding (31:38 - 31:46)
clear ye yeah I would I would I cannot (31:42 - 31:48)
imagine (31:46 - 31:52)
how hard it is to have (31:48 - 31:55)
like this company is making this game (31:52 - 31:56)
this company is making this game we have (31:55 - 31:58)
this anime we have these cards we have (31:56 - 32:01)
this merch we need this stuff to line up (31:58 - 32:05)
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s incredibly (32:01 - 32:09)
difficult the name on the other hand it (32:05 - 32:12)
it instantly reminded me of square (32:09 - 32:16)
Square Enix making a company (32:12 - 32:18)
called what&#39;s it called it&#39;s like (32:16 - 32:21)
creative business 3 or something like (32:18 - 32:24)
that it&#39;s like the most generic name (32:21 - 32:27)
ever but like they&#39;re responsible for (32:24 - 32:31)
like Final Fantasy 15 and (32:27 - 32:31)
16 they&#39;re (32:31 - 32:36)
like is it creative business unit three (32:33 - 32:39)
isn&#39;t it yeah yeah I think that&#39;s it (32:36 - 32:41)
creative business unit 3 which is like (32:39 - 32:45)
the most generic SL also evil (32:41 - 32:47)
organization name like it is so blind (32:45 - 32:49)
you&#39;re like they are totally (32:47 - 32:52)
experimenting on puppies in that place (32:49 - 32:54)
and there&#39;s no unit one or unit two just (32:52 - 32:56)
like for this there&#39;s no there&#39;s no (32:54 - 32:59)
Pokemon card a b or (32:56 - 33:03)
C just Pokemon card d d we&#39;re just (32:59 - 33:04)
jumping (33:03 - 33:07)
ahead nobody asks about those other ones (33:04 - 33:09)
they existed for two minutes and then (33:07 - 33:12)
they imploded it&#39;s like another level of (33:09 - 33:15)
generic that (33:12 - 33:15)
like inspirational generic (33:15 - 33:23)
um yeah (33:19 - 33:23)
I I would still (33:23 - 33:31)
guess that we would see something if not (33:26 - 33:34)
have even maybe a demo around (33:31 - 33:38)
worlds I would think so like it would (33:34 - 33:40)
see like I really don&#39;t think we&#39;re (33:38 - 33:44)
getting Za stuff this year like maybe (33:40 - 33:46)
maybe (33:44 - 33:46)
like uh uh maybe like a reminder that (33:48 - 33:53)
it&#39;s coming whether that&#39;s like a (33:52 - 33:56)
slightly longer version of what they&#39;ve (33:53 - 34:00)
already shown like an actual trailer an (33:56 - 34:03)
actual very rough first look like like (34:00 - 34:05)
the very first Legends trailer which (34:03 - 34:09)
like yeah was it it it showed stuff (34:05 - 34:12)
right but it didn&#39;t show anything that (34:09 - 34:14)
was it what what it showed was everyone (34:12 - 34:15)
just thought it was going to be this (34:14 - 34:18)
open world game and it wasn&#39;t (34:15 - 34:21)
yeah well but like I (34:18 - 34:24)
I I would assume that this is the only (34:21 - 34:26)
thing they really have this year is (34:24 - 34:27)
which is fine it&#39;s like not a complaint (34:26 - 34:30)
but like (34:27 - 34:30)
pocket seems like the the thing they (34:30 - 34:35)
have on top of just constant updates to (34:32 - 34:38)
what they already have going out there I (34:35 - 34:40)
could definitely imagine them doing a (34:38 - 34:43)
demo like they did with Masters at (34:40 - 34:46)
Worlds yeah because they&#39;ve had at (34:43 - 34:47)
Nashville they had like the let&#39;s go (34:46 - 34:49)
Pikachu let&#39;s go Eevee (34:47 - 34:52)
demo they had Masters demo I think at (34:49 - 34:54)
the DC one which was the year (34:52 - 34:56)
after (34:54 - 34:59)
um they had demo stations at London I (34:56 - 35:00)
don&#39;t remember what they (34:59 - 35:02)
[Music] (35:00 - 35:06)
were but yeah I (35:02 - 35:10)
would I don&#39;t know it I I I&#39;m very (35:06 - 35:11)
excited (35:10 - 35:13)
regardless I just hope it comes out this (35:11 - 35:16)
year like they&#39;ve said that&#39;s the I&#39;m a (35:13 - 35:18)
little worried well they have until (35:16 - 35:21)
December 31st to have it come out this (35:18 - 35:23)
year and if they&#39;re like any other (35:21 - 35:25)
division they wait until the last minute (35:23 - 35:30)
to meet that to meet that need (35:25 - 35:30)
yeah I hope it&#39;s not (35:31 - 35:37)
like I think I think Pokemon fans (35:33 - 35:38)
probably would be worried just in the (35:37 - 35:40)
sense of like they announced Pokemon (35:38 - 35:42)
sleep and then we heard nothing about it (35:40 - 35:45)
for what three years yeah to be fair (35:42 - 35:47)
they didn&#39;t say like here&#39;s Pokemon (35:45 - 35:49)
sleep it&#39;s coming later this year they (35:47 - 35:54)
they had no date nope but yeah I&#39;m they (35:49 - 35:58)
they did say this year so (35:54 - 35:58)
you know they did say early 2022 for (35:58 - 36:06)
Legends and it did indeed come early (36:01 - 36:06)
2022 the only thing that they&#39;ve (36:07 - 36:13)
publicly ever (36:10 - 36:13)
delayed (36:13 - 36:17)
recently I mean maybe something 15 years (36:15 - 36:18)
ago that I can&#39;t think of off the top of (36:17 - 36:22)
my head was TCG (36:18 - 36:26)
live was supposed to come out around the (36:22 - 36:28)
time of brilliant Diamond shotting Pearl (36:26 - 36:31)
and then they actually said we need more (36:28 - 36:32)
time for (36:31 - 36:35)
this (36:32 - 36:37)
um in reality they should have said we (36:35 - 36:38)
need more time for brilliant Diamond (36:37 - 36:43)
shining Pearl yeah (36:38 - 36:43)
but (36:43 - 36:51)
uh more TCG stuff although not (36:46 - 36:51)
probably for a very specific set of (36:51 - 36:57)
people I guess there&#39;s a new facility in (36:54 - 37:01)
Tokyo that just opened on April 25th um (36:57 - 37:03)

to play Pokemon TCG with randomly in (39:16 - 39:21)
Japan is is a scenario I would like to (39:19 - 39:24)
happen but probably won&#39;t um you can (39:21 - 39:27)
also extend that out uh they will they (39:24 - 39:30)
are saying the Lounge is cashless which (39:27 - 39:33)
is actually kind of rare for Japan Japan (39:30 - 39:37)
loves their cash the lounge also has a a (39:33 - 39:39)
merchandise area and if you go to (39:37 - 39:41)

the criminals are coming in to hire (40:02 - 40:07)
deductive Pikachu in a private booth all (40:04 - 40:11)
Noir like into this make it (40:07 - 40:15)
happen so as as somebody who is going to (40:11 - 40:18)
Japan relatively soon for for Sendai go (40:15 - 40:19)
Fest (40:18 - 40:24)
um it is a nightmare to book a lot of (40:19 - 40:26)
popular things in Japan because you&#39;re (40:24 - 40:27)
not only fighting with tourism you&#39;re f (40:26 - 40:29)
fighting with people who live there my (40:27 - 40:31)
my friend Julie who has lived in Japan (40:29 - 40:33)
for eight years she told me she&#39;s never (40:31 - 40:36)
been to the Pokemon cafe in Tokyo (40:33 - 40:40)
because it is so hard to get a ticket to (40:36 - 40:42)
it I&#39;ve successfully booked it both (40:40 - 40:45)
times I&#39;ve went and it took me four (40:42 - 40:48)
nights of staying up until five 4 a.m. (40:45 - 40:50)
to book this because what what will (40:48 - 40:52)
happen I will give you the tip here&#39;s (40:50 - 40:54)
the tip I will I have no gatekeeping (40:52 - 40:56)
here on how to do this so it goes live (40:54 - 41:01)
at 6:00 p.m. every day in Japan 6 p.m. J (40:56 - 41:06)
jst and then it will open up 52 seats (41:01 - 41:09)
for the cafe in Tokyo say it&#39;s the same (41:06 - 41:12)
for Kyoto but I think Kyoto is it Kyoto (41:09 - 41:15)
or is it Osaka it might be Osaka um it (41:12 - 41:17)
has a little little less than seats so (41:15 - 41:21)
every day you can book 31 days out so if (41:17 - 41:23)
you&#39;re trip to Japan is in two weeks (41:21 - 41:25)
that ship has sailed you are not getting (41:23 - 41:27)
into the Pokemon cafe like you have to (41:25 - 41:30)
you have to really plan out your 31 days (41:27 - 41:33)
of like you got it and like there&#39;s (41:30 - 41:34)
there&#39;s like there&#39;s like six days I&#39;m (41:33 - 41:37)
in Sendai so that&#39;s like six like I&#39;m I (41:34 - 41:39)
can&#39;t I mean I could book but it&#39;s like (41:37 - 41:42)
two and a half hours from Tokyo to suai (41:39 - 41:44)
so it&#39;s like am I gonna leave Sendai two (41:42 - 41:46)
and a half hours down to go to the cafe (41:44 - 41:47)
and then two and a half hours back to (41:46 - 41:51)
Sendai um so anyways it so it&#39;s 4:00 a. (41:47 - 41:54)
Central Time it goes live when it goes (41:51 - 41:57)
live you have to be on the website uh (41:54 - 41:59)
keep the website in Japanese I know (41:57 - 42:00)
Google translate will be like we can (41:59 - 42:03)
translate this website don&#39;t do that it (42:00 - 42:07)
will not it&#39;s not helpful at all just (42:03 - 42:09)
it&#39;s it&#39;s in it&#39;s a Japanese calendar (42:07 - 42:11)
you know that like 31 it&#39;s still a (42:09 - 42:13)
calendar it&#39;s very easy to figure (42:11 - 42:16)
out and then what will happen is all the (42:13 - 42:18)
seats will pick and you have to tap you (42:16 - 42:20)
have to tap on one and then scroll down (42:18 - 42:24)
and hit um well you have to tap on the (42:20 - 42:27)
day scroll down and hit okay and then (42:24 - 42:29)
you&#39;ll see all the times and you just (42:27 - 42:31)
pick what time you want which is (42:29 - 42:32)
literally any time you see first you (42:31 - 42:34)
click on that once and then you hope it (42:32 - 42:38)
loads don&#39;t refresh or anything and if (42:34 - 42:42)
it loads in it will ask for your name a (42:38 - 42:44)
phone number and an email address and (42:42 - 42:46)
then the email address is to send you (42:44 - 42:48)
like a six-digit pen to then verify that (42:46 - 42:49)
you&#39;re not a robot and then you can (42:48 - 42:51)
continue with the booking once you get (42:49 - 42:53)
into the name part you have like 10 (42:51 - 42:56)
minutes to you&#39;re like safe it&#39;s not (42:53 - 42:58)
like somebody else&#39;s like going to enter (42:56 - 43:00)
their information faster but what will (42:58 - 43:01)
happen this is the part people don&#39;t (43:00 - 43:05)
know here&#39;s the tip so at 4:00 a 4: a.m. (43:01 - 43:08)
it goes live everyone goes in and then (43:05 - 43:09)
within like within 30 seconds you know (43:08 - 43:12)
if you got it or not because it&#39;s it&#39;s (43:09 - 43:15)
going to fill up but for the people who (43:12 - 43:17)
fail to complete their form the people (43:15 - 43:19)
who cancel out the people who like (43:17 - 43:20)
messed up and accidentally closed their (43:19 - 43:24)
browser those reservations get (43:20 - 43:27)
redistributed again 20 minutes later (43:24 - 43:29)
exactly and they do that every 20 (43:27 - 43:31)
minutes until all the reservations are (43:29 - 43:32)
full so this is the part people don&#39;t (43:31 - 43:35)
know they they they go in at 4:00 they (43:32 - 43:37)
fail and then they they try again the (43:35 - 43:40)
next night you sit there and you wait (43:37 - 43:43)
you wait four o&#39;clock 4:20 4:40 5 (43:40 - 43:47)
o&#39;clock 5:20 no normally by five o&#39;clock (43:43 - 43:50)
they&#39;re all gone but I (43:47 - 43:54)
I I I messed up I I psyched myself out I (43:50 - 43:56)
panicked the first night and I I I (43:54 - 43:59)
accidentally I accidentally refreshed it (43:56 - 44:00)
kicked me all the way out to screen at (43:59 - 44:02)
4:00 I was like I&#39;m done for I was like (44:00 - 44:03)
you know what I&#39;ll wait till 4:40 (44:02 - 44:07)
tonight or 4:20 I get in at (44:03 - 44:10)
420 I I get to the I can see like (44:07 - 44:12)
onethird of the reservations available (44:10 - 44:15)
at 420 I click on one I don&#39;t see any (44:12 - 44:18)
loading bar it doesn&#39;t do anything I (44:15 - 44:20)
panic so I click on the reservation next (44:18 - 44:22)
to it and then I get a popup saying you (44:20 - 44:24)
already have a reservation would you (44:22 - 44:27)
like to go back and I was like no it was (44:24 - 44:29)
was just thinking I had the reservation (44:27 - 44:31)
locked but then when I hit the back (44:29 - 44:33)
button it kicked me all the way out so I (44:31 - 44:38)
lost both reservations know so I like so (44:33 - 44:41)
at 4:40 it popped up again and there was (44:38 - 44:43)
only like maybe like five reservations (44:41 - 44:46)
at 4 440 but again like I said most (44:43 - 44:49)
people give up by then uh and then I was (44:46 - 44:52)
able to lock in a (44:49 - 44:54)
reservation it was a lot of my life (44:52 - 44:58)
going back to the Pokemon card Lounge (44:54 - 45:00)
it looks like as long as you plan it out (44:58 - 45:02)
about two days in advance they have (45:00 - 45:03)
plenty of (45:02 - 45:06)
reservations (45:03 - 45:06)
um it&#39;s just playing TCG so I guess that (45:08 - 45:14)
like the the Pokemon cafe experience is (45:11 - 45:15)
definitely like you&#39;re going there and (45:14 - 45:17)
you&#39;re getting very unique meals they (45:15 - 45:18)
change the meals every couple months (45:17 - 45:22)
there&#39;s exclusive merch um it&#39;s like (45:18 - 45:24)
this whole thing a visitor will appear (45:22 - 45:26)
whether that&#39;s like Gengar or Eevee or (45:24 - 45:27)
Pikachu or whatever they&#39;ll appear and (45:26 - 45:29)
they&#39;ll do their song and dance um this (45:27 - 45:33)

friend going to play against us um it&#39;s (45:39 - 45:47)
cool that there&#39;s like like a lot of (45:44 - 45:50)
cafes like net cafes or cat cafes or (45:47 - 45:52)
something it&#39;s like you pay an entry fee (45:50 - 45:55)
but you get like a free drink so like (45:52 - 45:57)
that&#39;s like not unique to this that&#39;s (45:55 - 45:59)
like a very popular thing in Japan of (45:57 - 46:01)
like oh like pay $15 to go to the Cat (45:59 - 46:04)
Cafe and you get like an hour and you (46:01 - 46:06)

shabuya um and like I said it literally (46:13 - 46:17)
opened on April (46:15 - 46:21)
25th and yeah I (46:17 - 46:23)
if I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the best (46:21 - 46:26)
American tourist attraction (46:23 - 46:29)
cuz I don&#39;t know if a Japanese person (46:26 - 46:31)
who wants to play TCG wants to play (46:29 - 46:33)
against you and you&#39;re like let me (46:31 - 46:35)
Google Translate each one of your (46:33 - 46:38)
cards or if you like brought your own (46:35 - 46:41)
American Deck they would be like I don&#39;t (46:38 - 46:44)

and a friend are going and you&#39;re like I (46:44 - 46:47)
want to check this out I want to check (46:45 - 46:49)

experience for an hour for two people (46:52 - 46:56)
that&#39;s not bad that&#39;s not bad and it (46:54 - 46:57)
yeah it doesn&#39;t (46:56 - 46:59)
like I said I there&#39;s plenty of (46:57 - 47:01)
reservations when I checked this is not (46:59 - 47:02)
not the (47:01 - 47:06)
Pokemon uh Cafe issue Cafe and the merch (47:02 - 47:09)
is really good so I feel like it&#39;s (47:06 - 47:11)
almost worth it just for the merch yeah (47:09 - 47:13)
I I hope (47:11 - 47:16)
that I don&#39;t know that sounds that (47:13 - 47:17)
sounds like I&#39;m gatekeeping I was going (47:16 - 47:20)
to say I hope that in order to buy the (47:17 - 47:22)
merch you have to get a ticket you have (47:20 - 47:25)
to like pay your entry fee cuz otherwise (47:22 - 47:27)
I could see people just going in buying (47:25 - 47:29)
out all the (47:27 - 47:32)
merch and then like like I would I would (47:29 - 47:35)
be bummed if I go there and they&#39;ll be (47:32 - 47:37)
like oh we have no merch like oh that (47:35 - 47:41)
like I would kind of like something for (47:37 - 47:43)
my time going because the merch does (47:41 - 47:44)
look really (47:43 - 47:49)
cool now the Kirby Cafe they do their (47:44 - 47:52)
reservations on the 10th of every month (47:49 - 47:56)
and then they open it up for the next 31 (47:52 - 47:57)
days (47:56 - 48:01)
and then that&#39;s it so Kirby Cafe is a (47:57 - 48:04)
whole another level of of of booking (48:01 - 48:08)
Final Fantasy 14 Cafe Greg pretty easy (48:04 - 48:10)

Fest just that when I come back trying (48:53 - 48:58)
to play that game is going to be an (48:55 - 49:01)
absolute chaotic nightmare for the first (48:58 - 49:05)
week I can&#39;t remember the the guy&#39;s name (49:01 - 49:08)
yo Yoshi Yoshi Yoshi P didn&#39;t didn&#39;t he (49:05 - 49:10)
say on stage that he was like delaying (49:08 - 49:12)
it because he didn&#39;t he wanted to play (49:10 - 49:15)
the Elden ring (49:12 - 49:15)
DLC so he like delayed a week so he (49:16 - 49:21)
could play Elden ring yeah Yoshi beats (49:18 - 49:23)
the (49:21 - 49:25)
best (49:23 - 49:29)
um uh yes so so tourism in Japan is like (49:25 - 49:31)
at an all-time high right now I (49:29 - 49:35)
don&#39;t know I have a big decision to make (49:31 - 49:39)
right now what hit me with (49:35 - 49:43)
it so the next Star Wars celebrations is (49:39 - 49:46)
in Japan 2025 in (49:43 - 49:49)
April which means I have to decide to (49:46 - 49:51)
buy tickets to Star Wars celebration in (49:49 - 49:54)
Japan literally this week or I will not (49:51 - 49:56)
get tickets so I have to decide that in (49:54 - 49:58)
a year (49:56 - 50:00)
will I be will I have the funds and (49:58 - 50:03)
everything to go to Japan which I do (50:00 - 50:04)
want to because next year&#39;s my 55th (50:03 - 50:06)
birthday and I wanted to take a big trip (50:04 - 50:08)
and the things were like go to Japan or (50:06 - 50:10)
go to New Zealand that was sort of the (50:08 - 50:13)
The Cho the two choices the Star Wars (50:10 - 50:14)
thing has pushed me towards the Japan (50:13 - 50:17)
thing but I need to decide this week is (50:14 - 50:19)
that at (50:17 - 50:23)
Disney no oh it&#39;s at the it&#39;s at a (50:19 - 50:26)
Convention Center that&#39;s like north of (50:23 - 50:28)
um (50:26 - 50:30)
Tokyo I forget what it&#39;s called Disney (50:28 - 50:32)
owns Star Wars now though right they do (50:30 - 50:34)
but they don&#39;t do things I was like was (50:32 - 50:38)
that a dumb question no no no like they (50:34 - 50:41)
have Galaxy&#39;s Edge but that couldn&#39;t (50:38 - 50:44)
hold that couldn&#39;t they couldn&#39;t they (50:41 - 50:46)
couldn&#39;t hold everybody there plus (50:44 - 50:47)
there&#39;s nowhere to sit and listen to (50:46 - 50:50)
panels and stuff uh it&#39;s oh so this is (50:47 - 50:53)
this is a whole like convention this is (50:50 - 50:55)
star (50:53 - 50:58)
convention uh star is coming to Japan (50:55 - 51:02)
and uh it is how much is a ticket to (50:58 - 51:06)
said like if it&#39;s like a $30 ticket you (51:02 - 51:07)
might as well buy it even if you don&#39;t (51:06 - 51:09)
know if you&#39;re going right but well a 3D (51:07 - 51:13)
ticket per person uh is $155 which is (51:09 - 51:16)
normal for a convention that&#39;s not too (51:13 - 51:19)
bad for something year out it&#39;s a (51:16 - 51:22)
three-day ticket it&#39;s (51:19 - 51:27)
23,000 Yen for it&#39;s April 18th to 20th (51:22 - 51:30)
which is fine but it&#39;s already sold out (51:27 - 51:32)
like the adult passes are already sold (51:30 - 51:34)
out so all that&#39;s left are the single (51:32 - 51:40)
days which is like okay I have to decide (51:34 - 51:43)
that I may already be too late and (51:40 - 51:46)
deciding to do this it&#39;s Makara mess (51:43 - 51:50)
Japan which I believe is just North of (51:46 - 51:53)
Tokyo but yeah it like I knew the (51:50 - 51:55)
three-day passes were going to sell out (51:53 - 51:58)
I have to decide like literally Nosh if (51:55 - 52:01)
I&#39;m going to do this or not and who (51:58 - 52:03)
knows what conversion rate will be at (52:01 - 52:05)
that point huh who knows what the (52:03 - 52:06)
conversion rate will be at that point (52:05 - 52:09)
because it&#39;s better now than I&#39;ve ever (52:06 - 52:11)
seen it in our (52:09 - 52:13)
favor yeah not in Japan&#39;s favor (52:11 - 52:15)
definitely in yeah it&#39;s definitely in (52:13 - 52:16)
our (52:15 - 52:19)
favor this is the convention center that (52:16 - 52:21)
that looks really nicely put it in or a (52:19 - 52:24)
little chat here um speaking of (52:21 - 52:27)
convention centers uh you can book your (52:24 - 52:30)
reservation dang my TR we we are on fire (52:27 - 52:32)
with moving these you can book your (52:30 - 52:36)
reservation to visit the 2024 ni NAIC (52:32 - 52:38)
Pokemon Center which you do need a (52:36 - 52:41)
reservation for even though I will (52:38 - 52:42)
personally say I don&#39;t think it was (52:41 - 52:45)
handled very well in Ohio but that&#39;s (52:42 - 52:48)
besides the point uh there is a popup (52:45 - 52:49)
Pokemon Center book your reservations (52:48 - 52:50)
this on (52:49 - 52:52)
pokemon.com it&#39;s on the homepage if (52:50 - 52:55)
you&#39;re looking for where to do this um (52:52 - 52:57)
in if there will be exclusive (52:55 - 52:59)
merchandise you can only get at the (52:57 - 53:02)
event you need to have a reservation to (52:59 - 53:04)
enter that&#39;s what they&#39;re saying on (53:02 - 53:08)
pokemon.com so if you&#39;re in New Orleans (53:04 - 53:12)
uh you don&#39;t need it at least on this on (53:08 - 53:15)
pokemon.com you don&#39;t need a ticket (53:12 - 53:18)
spectator pass to the North American (53:15 - 53:19)
International championships you just (53:18 - 53:21)
need a reservation to Pokemon Center (53:19 - 53:25)
this is the same in Ohio which I think I (53:21 - 53:27)
probably argued if (53:25 - 53:29)
feels like Spectators should have (53:27 - 53:31)
priority since they bought a ticket to (53:29 - 53:35)
the event but they also want to sell (53:31 - 53:37)
their merch to anyone who shows (53:35 - 53:42)
up uh in addition uh Pokemon fans uh (53:37 - 53:44)
will get a bonus item they&#39;re (53:42 - 53:46)
showing (53:44 - 53:49)
the ceru edge Pokemon day TCG card will (53:46 - 53:52)
be a gift when you purchase (53:49 - 53:55)
something uh and the Pikachu bear brick (53:52 - 53:58)
figure will also be a gift if you purch (53:55 - 53:59)
something (53:58 - 54:02)
which that that&#39;s that weird little (53:59 - 54:04)
Pikachu that looks like a (54:02 - 54:08)
bear that never sold they probably made (54:04 - 54:11)
way too many of (54:08 - 54:11)
them the it&#39;s still it&#39;s like it was (54:11 - 54:16)
like 20 bucks on Pokemon Center yeah it (54:14 - 54:20)
still is I remember we talked about (54:16 - 54:20)
this the weird bear brick Pikachu um (54:20 - 54:27)
those are bonus items that it says that (54:24 - 54:31)
will be available as gifts with (54:27 - 54:33)
purchase uh while supplies last they (54:31 - 54:36)
also go out of their way to say just in (54:33 - 54:38)
case you purchase a lot of (54:36 - 54:42)
product don&#39;t worry we understand but (54:38 - 54:44)
there will be a FedEx shipping kiosk (54:42 - 54:47)
available at the NAIC Pokemon Center (54:44 - 54:50)
popup store so fans can ship their items (54:47 - 54:53)
home for an additional fee it is easier (54:50 - 54:54)
than carrying around your purchases (54:53 - 54:56)
during the event or trying to pack them (54:54 - 54:57)
in your luggage (54:56 - 54:59)
the FedEx Mobile shipping kiosk will be (54:57 - 55:01)
located outside Hall G and you can now (54:59 - 55:04)
streamline your scalping experience by (55:01 - 55:08)
setting up a FedEx account (55:04 - 55:11)
now (55:08 - 55:15)
uh it will be from June 7th through 9th (55:11 - 55:17)
uh you must have a reservation no (55:15 - 55:18)
walk-ins allowed to ensure as many (55:17 - 55:20)
people as possible fans can only book (55:18 - 55:24)
one reservation time per day um all (55:20 - 55:27)
jokes aside I think it is really great (55:24 - 55:29)
that there&#39;s a FedEx thing for you to (55:27 - 55:31)
ship stuff I think that&#39;s great I think (55:29 - 55:32)
that&#39;s (55:31 - 55:35)
fantastic if if they do not do the thing (55:32 - 55:37)
that they fail to do every time which is (55:35 - 55:39)
like limit purchase items no one no one (55:37 - 55:43)
needs eight backpacks I&#39;m you you just (55:39 - 55:45)
don&#39;t you don&#39;t have seven children I I (55:43 - 55:48)
Pro maybe somebody does but I think (55:45 - 55:51)
somebody with seven children maybe not (55:48 - 55:52)
have the budget for seven backpacks what (55:51 - 55:56)
do I know (55:52 - 55:56)
but it&#39;s always the backpacks it&#39;s the I (55:59 - 56:05)
guarantee you on Twitter or threads or (56:02 - 56:07)
whatever you&#39;re going to see (56:05 - 56:10)
backpack drama that like I waited in (56:07 - 56:13)
line 10 hours and somebody walked out (56:10 - 56:15)
with 20 (56:13 - 56:15)
backpacks the FedEx thing is nice though (56:17 - 56:22)
yeah I think it&#39;s neat that they have (56:20 - 56:24)
that specially set (56:22 - 56:28)
up but yeah the limiting limiting (56:24 - 56:31)
purchases is a thing they haven&#39;t quite (56:28 - 56:34)
figured out yet (56:31 - 56:34)
still I I feel like it&#39;s pretty easy I (56:34 - 56:39)
feel you just put a little sign that (56:37 - 56:42)
says limit one limit (56:39 - 56:45)
two I feel I feel like somebody could (56:42 - 56:47)
just print their own like limit one (56:45 - 56:50)
limit two and just go in and just like (56:47 - 56:53)
stick them to everything and solve the (56:50 - 56:57)
problem for them probably (56:53 - 56:57)
uh so yeah if if you are in the norleans (56:59 - 57:07)
area you should you should go you should (57:03 - 57:10)
usually a spectator pass is (57:07 - 57:13)
like like usually 12 (57:10 - 57:16)
bucks um dang this Japanese Convention (57:13 - 57:20)
Center looks awesome it is it looks (57:16 - 57:20)
great uh but I I I won&#39;t be going to New (57:20 - 57:26)
Orleans I was going to originally go to (57:25 - 57:28)

conversation and and the good (59:25 - 59:30)
transitions after the (59:27 - 59:34)

break James (59:34 - 59:43)
Turner where did that website go (59:38 - 59:47)
uh so Pokemon (59:43 - 59:50)
center.com released a brand new merch (59:47 - 59:53)
drop called lazy (59:50 - 59:57)
summer and it is in collaboration and (59:53 - 59:59)
they go out of their way multiple times (59:57 - 60:02)
to say that this collaboration was made (59:59 - 60:04)
by James Turner (60:02 - 60:08)
which I I we&#39;ve mentioned James Turner&#39;s (60:04 - 60:10)
name a bunch of times on this show but (60:08 - 60:12)
if you don&#39;t know who James Turner is (60:10 - 60:14)
they are (60:12 - 60:19)
the first non-japanese (60:14 - 60:19)
humanum (60:20 - 60:24)
to person also (60:22 - 60:28)
works to make a Pokemon cuz every (60:24 - 60:30)
Pokemon up to this point has been made (60:28 - 60:34)
by somebody from Japan they&#39;re from the (60:30 - 60:38)
UK they&#39;re they&#39;re British uh they (60:34 - 60:41)
originally worked on Coliseum and Gale (60:38 - 60:43)
of darkness and then they eventually (60:41 - 60:48)
moved over to work for Game Freak uh (60:43 - 60:52)
they helped finalize and design Shadow (60:48 - 60:55)
Lugia in Gale of darkness and then they (60:52 - 60:57)
made a lot of the character models in (60:55 - 61:00)
Coliseum andela darkness (60:57 - 61:05)
and they went on to make like Phantom (61:00 - 61:08)
vanillite Gooler poiple (61:05 - 61:11)
buzwell uh a bunch of Pokemon uh they (61:08 - 61:14)
also made the pal paldan (61:11 - 61:17)
Taos they made taguri they made (61:14 - 61:20)
dondoo that being said they were the art (61:17 - 61:23)
director of sword and (61:20 - 61:27)
shield and then they left mid way of (61:23 - 61:29)
development of scarlet and violet to (61:27 - 61:31)
start their own video game company and (61:29 - 61:34)
they&#39;re making a video game called the (61:31 - 61:36)
Plucky Squire I think which is supposed (61:34 - 61:38)
to come out this year MH so they no (61:36 - 61:40)
longer work for Game Freak they no (61:38 - 61:42)
longer work for the Pokemon (61:40 - 61:44)
company uh even though they&#39;ve been (61:42 - 61:47)
around since well their first Pokemon (61:44 - 61:48)
appeared in Gen 5 but they&#39;ve been (61:47 - 61:51)
around before Gen 5 so it was a bummer (61:48 - 61:52)
to see them (61:51 - 61:56)
leave but clearly on very good terms (61:52 - 61:59)
with the that&#39;s the news that&#39;s the news (61:56 - 62:01)
clearly on very very good terms with the (61:59 - 62:04)
Pokemon company CU not only did they (62:01 - 62:07)
do this is a huge merch (62:04 - 62:10)
drop huge huge merch drop they have so (62:07 - 62:11)
much stuff I don&#39;t know if anything (62:10 - 62:16)
stands out to uh you two at all (62:11 - 62:19)
here it&#39;s not really my St strik be is (62:16 - 62:22)
how late 80s retro it is that&#39;s what I (62:19 - 62:24)
love and I wasn&#39;t even born well I was (62:22 - 62:26)
born in the 80s I guess which which just (62:24 - 62:31)
it&#39;s hard for me to to get back into cuz (62:26 - 62:32)
I did it (62:31 - 62:37)
once and I&#39;m mostly sort of over that (62:32 - 62:41)
aesthetic but I think they look they (62:37 - 62:46)
look great like it is a very distinct (62:41 - 62:49)
and unique style it&#39;s a bummer that the (62:46 - 62:51)
crop tops are only in women&#39;s sizes and (62:49 - 62:55)
they have no male crop top options I (62:51 - 62:57)
feel like that was a Miss for the summer (62:55 - 63:00)
you can manually crop your own top but (62:57 - 63:03)
you should probably get a sewing machine (63:00 - 63:06)
so that it doesn&#39;t Fray at the bottom (63:03 - 63:09)
and if Nick is listening that needs to (63:06 - 63:11)
be break music something about cropping (63:09 - 63:14)
your own top we need that I usually (63:11 - 63:17)
don&#39;t call that out (63:14 - 63:17)
but I think we it&#39;s time stamp this (63:18 - 63:24)
part that&#39;s up to you put it in the (63:21 - 63:27)
notes I have never never told Nick to (63:24 - 63:31)
turn my the dumb things I say into music (63:27 - 63:33)
he has always gone out of his way to (63:31 - 63:35)
find the dumb things I say people in (63:33 - 63:38)
slack help a lot that&#39;s true that&#39;s true (63:35 - 63:41)
slack does direct Nick too they the (63:38 - 63:44)
Corduroy thing happened because of (63:41 - 63:48)
SL that was pretty (63:44 - 63:51)
good the premium the the the adree the (63:48 - 63:54)
listeners get the get the weird remix (63:51 - 63:56)
versions of our (63:54 - 64:00)
voices in in song (63:56 - 64:04)
form I think what were you saying Hannah (64:00 - 64:06)
that it didn&#39;t stand out to you it&#39;s (64:04 - 64:09)
just not my style none of it not really (64:06 - 64:12)
my colors not really my style I think it (64:09 - 64:14)
looks great not your Pokemon choices not (64:12 - 64:18)
my Pokemon choices yeah CL there isn&#39;t a (64:14 - 64:21)
Claire if there was the colors would (64:18 - 64:24)
probably be closer to my style cuz I (64:21 - 64:28)
like the color brown but no nope this is (64:24 - 64:30)
very (64:28 - 64:34)
pastel it&#39;s very late 80s early (64:30 - 64:34)
90s (64:35 - 64:39)
um yeah just I don&#39;t know there&#39;s (64:37 - 64:41)
something like really cool about them (64:39 - 64:44)
continuing to work with (64:41 - 64:48)
James like that like I I think I feel (64:44 - 64:49)
like when somebody leaves a company (64:48 - 64:51)
there&#39;s always like what was the drama (64:49 - 64:53)
what was the bad blood like how do you (64:51 - 64:56)
go from being an art director to the (64:53 - 64:58)
bestselling Pokemon game of all time to (64:56 - 65:01)
then like not working for the Pokemon (64:58 - 65:03)
company and it&#39;s (65:01 - 65:06)
like he wanted to make his own game yeah (65:03 - 65:08)
I get that I mean I think we said at the (65:06 - 65:11)
time it&#39;s not surprising (65:08 - 65:13)
that sometimes you want to go do your (65:11 - 65:15)
own thing and you don&#39;t want to work for (65:13 - 65:17)
another person you&#39;re like I&#39;m good at (65:15 - 65:19)
this and people like what I do so I&#39;m (65:17 - 65:22)
just going to have it be very direct at (65:19 - 65:25)
me and that&#39;s you know that is that is (65:22 - 65:29)
an absolute option yeah I mean you don&#39;t (65:25 - 65:32)
have to stay at the same company for (65:29 - 65:36)
forever I mean I tried because I am lazy (65:32 - 65:39)
but and a lot of times you you need to (65:36 - 65:41)
switch (65:39 - 65:45)
um in in the environment we have (65:41 - 65:48)
today but I don&#39;t know it seems like (65:45 - 65:50)
he&#39;s still working with them well I had (65:48 - 65:52)
honestly thought because we all kind of (65:50 - 65:56)
decided that the world&#39;s logo this year (65:52 - 66:01)
is almost definitely James Turner art um (65:56 - 66:03)
I had kind of assumed that was done (66:01 - 66:07)
before the separation from Game Freak (66:03 - 66:09)
just because worlds is planned a fair (66:07 - 66:13)
amount ahead of time but maybe (66:09 - 66:13)
not yeah oh I see what you&#39;re saying (66:14 - 66:19)
like maybe they reached out and they (66:17 - 66:21)
were like there (66:19 - 66:26)
was I I did try to look into cuz um if (66:21 - 66:28)
you go to Bubble pedia you can see like (66:26 - 66:30)
who did what like bubble pedia is a (66:28 - 66:32)
pretty good reference of like so and so (66:30 - 66:35)
worked on this project or this logo or (66:32 - 66:37)
this (66:35 - 66:40)
and the artist who has done a lot of (66:37 - 66:43)
those logos they also have done like 40 (66:40 - 66:45)
some Pokemon cards and none none of them (66:43 - 66:47)
line up to (66:45 - 66:50)
like the same art style that you see on (66:47 - 66:52)
the current world&#39;s logo and if you (66:50 - 66:54)
literally look at James Turner&#39;s merch (66:52 - 66:57)
on Pokemon Center you very C that this (66:54 - 67:01)
art style matches that but there are (66:57 - 67:04)
some Pokemon cards not done by James (67:01 - 67:07)
Turner that do have like a broken (67:04 - 67:10)
line more it&#39;s more than just the broken (67:07 - 67:12)
lines it&#39;s the colors it&#39;s the style of (67:10 - 67:15)
the eyes it&#39;s the uh places the way the (67:12 - 67:17)
shading is it&#39;s the sh the general (67:15 - 67:20)
shapes of the Pokemon&#39;s heads and stuff (67:17 - 67:24)
like that there&#39;s a lot of things yeah (67:20 - 67:26)
but at Quick Glance the thing that gives (67:24 - 67:28)
it away is the lines not connecting (67:26 - 67:32)
fully but like also like I was James is (67:28 - 67:34)
not the only artist in the entire world (67:32 - 67:37)
that is yeah does not connect his (67:34 - 67:39)
lines there&#39;s lots of people that don&#39;t (67:37 - 67:41)
connect their lines (67:39 - 67:44)
um yeah it it it&#39;s a cool it&#39;s a cool (67:41 - 67:47)
set on Pokemon Center I&#39;m still always (67:44 - 67:50)
very very impressed on how much (67:47 - 67:53)
merch the Pokemon Center continues to (67:50 - 68:01)
put out over and over and over again um (67:53 - 68:01)
yeah final part I think final news here (68:01 - 68:09)
is uh Pokemon (68:05 - 68:12)
go uh let&#39;s start with (68:09 - 68:15)
how this is off 404 (68:12 - 68:18)
media. Pokemon go players invent fake (68:15 - 68:23)
beaches on real maps to catch Wiglet (68:18 - 68:23)
for Audio Only listeners Craig Craig is (68:31 - 68:37)
Craig is uncontrollably laughing it&#39;s (68:34 - 68:39)
just (68:37 - 68:42)
like (68:39 - 68:46)
God it&#39;s so (68:42 - 68:49)
stupid it&#39;s really (68:46 - 68:49)
good oh boy the article is kind of (68:52 - 68:58)
locked behind a pay wall so I don&#39;t know (68:56 - 69:00)
if it worked or not I feel like this (68:58 - 69:02)
isn&#39;t the kind of thing that would work (69:00 - 69:06)
I don&#39;t know why I why this article is (69:02 - 69:08)
pay wall is is beyond me I&#39;m not paying (69:06 - 69:10)
for it it says it&#39;s not a pay wall it&#39;s (69:08 - 69:12)
an account wall but still but I&#39;m not (69:10 - 69:15)
I&#39;m not giving something called 404 (69:12 - 69:18)
media they they&#39;re saying oh for those (69:15 - 69:20)
that don&#39;t know Pokemon go uses a a (69:18 - 69:23)
thing called open street map which is if (69:20 - 69:25)
you&#39;re like what is that just think of (69:23 - 69:26)
like (69:25 - 69:29)
Wikipedia But for (69:26 - 69:31)
maps that&#39;s like anyone can go in anyone (69:29 - 69:33)
can edit it you can see like the (69:31 - 69:36)
revision history people will if you (69:33 - 69:38)
people will correct it I I have I (69:36 - 69:40)
learned very early on that I was not cut (69:38 - 69:43)
out to be a Wiki editor those people (69:40 - 69:46)
have a different level of (69:43 - 69:50)
of patience or or (69:46 - 69:55)
timeliness uh not not great here um so (69:50 - 69:56)
ultimately what people were doing is (69:55 - 70:00)
they were going into into um open street (69:56 - 70:04)
maps and then changing areas to be (70:00 - 70:07)
beaches and then therefore those beaches (70:04 - 70:10)
would show up in Pokemon go and then if (70:07 - 70:11)
and then Wiglet would appear because (70:10 - 70:14)
Wiglet is only appearing on beaches uh (70:11 - 70:17)
Greg just sent a new article this is off (70:14 - 70:17)
yahoo.com on April (70:19 - 70:25)
22nd Yahoo Tech (70:22 - 70:28)
April 22nd Wiglet was added to Pokémon (70:25 - 70:31)
go um there&#39;s the author is saying so (70:28 - 70:34)
this means if you live in Kansas as I do (70:31 - 70:36)
you will have to travel to your nearest (70:34 - 70:39)
large lake or river to catch Wiglet or (70:36 - 70:41)
if those lakes and rivers are not (70:39 - 70:43)
considered beaches you will need to (70:41 - 70:44)
travel (70:43 - 70:46)
further (70:44 - 70:49)
uh uh well that&#39;s not the case because (70:46 - 70:51)
using some code I was able to see all (70:49 - 70:54)
the spawn locations in Kansas for Wiglet (70:51 - 70:56)
and turns out I am surrounded by fake (70:54 - 70:59)
[Laughter] (70:56 - 71:02)
beaches open street maps is a free open (70:59 - 71:05)
source map tool that&#39;s like Wikipedia (71:02 - 71:07)
meeting Google Maps draws Its Real World (71:05 - 71:09)
data and locations and since players (71:07 - 71:11)
have figured out two biomes in which (71:09 - 71:13)
Wiglet has spawn in they can load up (71:11 - 71:15)
open open street maps add fake beaches (71:13 - 71:18)
anywhere they want uh and that would be (71:15 - 71:20)
frustrating for people who are trying to (71:18 - 71:23)
maintain a proper mapping database on (71:20 - 71:25)
April 27th in a thread open street maps (71:23 - 71:27)
community members spotted these issues (71:25 - 71:29)
of fake beaches and quickly connected it (71:27 - 71:31)
to the launch of the new Coastal only (71:29 - 71:37)
Pokemon Wiglet uh it Al it also helped (71:31 - 71:39)
that some players were creating new (71:37 - 71:42)
beaches in the shape of Pokemon (71:39 - 71:45)
Pokeballs uh which is pretty obvious (71:42 - 71:49)
hint as who&#39;s to blame for the new (71:45 - 71:49)
beaches Hannah have you you are probably (71:50 - 71:55)
the person I would expect out of the (71:53 - 71:58)
three as three of us to go to an actual (71:55 - 72:01)
Beach have you found a Wiglet and or a (71:58 - 72:03)
beach had have you made a fake Beach to (72:01 - 72:07)
go to I have done none of the above um I (72:03 - 72:08)
may live in the Pacific Northwest but (72:07 - 72:12)
I&#39;m not particularly near the beach good (72:08 - 72:15)
would take a few hours to get there um (72:12 - 72:18)
there is water nearby me that I do want (72:15 - 72:21)
to go to to see if I can find wigl now (72:18 - 72:23)
here&#39;s here&#39;s another thing about (72:21 - 72:26)
Minnesota we have we have one of the (72:23 - 72:29)
most we have the highest percentage of (72:26 - 72:32)
beaches of most States because of how (72:29 - 72:36)
many lakes we have we have built so many (72:32 - 72:38)
beaches like again Minnesota you have a (72:36 - 72:40)
lot of options if you want to go to a (72:38 - 72:43)
beach because we have a lot of them yeah (72:40 - 72:45)
I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re asking me y&#39;all (72:43 - 72:47)
have more beaches than we have more (72:45 - 72:51)
beaches than most places uh when I was (72:47 - 72:54)
one Wheeling around Lake Nomas Greg Lake (72:51 - 72:56)
Nomas has (72:54 - 73:01)
a beach mhm uh and I was curious if it (72:56 - 73:05)
would indeed be a beach in the game (73:01 - 73:07)
right because it&#39;s it&#39;s not when I say (73:05 - 73:09)
it&#39;s a beach it&#39;s (73:07 - 73:11)
like you could walk this beach in like (73:09 - 73:13)
two minutes from one end to the other (73:11 - 73:16)
it&#39;s there&#39;s like sand and there&#39;s like (73:13 - 73:19)
umbrellas it it is in it&#39;s a beach by (73:16 - 73:21)
all definitions it&#39;s a beach it&#39;s just a (73:19 - 73:25)
very small Beach um and when I did click (73:21 - 73:28)
on a Pokemon on the beach it did have (73:25 - 73:29)
the beach background and then if I went (73:28 - 73:32)
2 minutes over it went back to park (73:29 - 73:34)
background or whatever um I did have a (73:32 - 73:37)
Wiglet pop up on my nearby but that was (73:34 - 73:40)
before the open street map drama of (73:37 - 73:43)
people like I didn&#39;t realize Wiglet was (73:40 - 73:46)
so like I didn&#39;t realize this it makes (73:43 - 73:47)
sense yeah it makes sense like if you (73:46 - 73:49)
live in (73:47 - 73:52)
Wyoming or North Dakota or I don&#39;t know (73:49 - 73:54)
I don&#39;t know maybe they do have beaches (73:52 - 73:57)
somewhere but I I that makes it makes (73:54 - 74:00)
sense like I don&#39;t have a beach how will (73:57 - 74:02)
I get this Pokemon I&#39;ll just make a (74:00 - 74:05)
beach yeah yeah it&#39;s a regional you&#39;re (74:02 - 74:07)
supposed to you&#39;re supposed to find the (74:05 - 74:09)
Regionals or trade for them that&#39;s the (74:07 - 74:12)
whole point I think it is a cool way (74:09 - 74:15)
that is a cool Regional like a cool way (74:12 - 74:17)
to do regionals I guess would be like it (74:15 - 74:20)
is a beach Pokemon I mean like that&#39;s (74:17 - 74:22)
kind of (74:20 - 74:25)
the the like dream they sold us the line (74:22 - 74:27)
between IES and (74:25 - 74:30)
regionals yeah yeah but I feel like this (74:27 - 74:31)

technically Pokemon go (75:16 - 75:21)
layoffs um this is off gamed (75:18 - 75:22)
development.com (75:21 - 75:26)
the I I think the the new news here is (75:22 - 75:29)
we now found a company that was working (75:26 - 75:32)
with Niantic I think that is the real (75:29 - 75:33)
news (75:32 - 75:35)
here but I&#39;ll I&#39;ll read you the article (75:33 - 75:39)
you can go from there Pokemon go codev (75:35 - 75:42)
ve very very spaceship the the the (75:39 - 75:46)
studio is called very very spaceship (75:42 - 75:49)
lays off staff it is unknown if very (75:46 - 75:51)
very spaceship Cuts have anything to do (75:49 - 75:53)
with Pokémon go and Niantic or the (75:51 - 75:56)
Studio&#39;s own accord (75:53 - 75:58)
various staff members were laid off at (75:56 - 76:00)
very very spaceship the Seattle based (75:58 - 76:02)
company that handled a handles tent pole (76:00 - 76:05)
features for Pokémon go specific numbers (76:02 - 76:07)
have not been revealed those effective (76:05 - 76:09)
include producers recruiters and artists (76:07 - 76:12)
and have been reported who have (76:09 - 76:16)
reportedly been at VVS for 3 to5 years (76:12 - 76:18)
vvs&#39;s most recent claims to Pokemon go (76:16 - 76:21)
Fame is The Game&#39;s updated character (76:18 - 76:23)
creation senior character artist Kelsey (76:21 - 76:26)
Martin expressed pride in in it noting (76:23 - 76:28)
the changes made it more exclusive and (76:26 - 76:31)
more expressive for players HR manager (76:28 - 76:33)
Sarah Carman said that despite her (76:31 - 76:36)
sadness she would won&#39;t allow it to take (76:33 - 76:38)
away from the amazing work she she or (76:36 - 76:40)
her team built at the time writing this (76:38 - 76:43)
it is unknown what prompted very very (76:40 - 76:46)
spaceships layoffs uh or how it affects (76:43 - 76:48)
niantic&#39;s current partnership or (76:46 - 76:52)
development um and then they go on and (76:48 - 76:55)
talk about a bunch of other Studios (76:52 - 76:58)
with recent layoffs I don&#39;t think that I (76:55 - 76:59)
think (76:58 - 77:02)
the tech layoffs is not surprising to (76:59 - 77:06)
anyone uh who especially anyone in Tech (77:02 - 77:09)
right now because Amazon (77:06 - 77:12)
Microsoft (77:09 - 77:16)
Sony everyone has had layoffs it&#39;s why (77:12 - 77:18)
like Destiny 2&#39;s expansion was delayed (77:16 - 77:19)
like six months because they were like (77:18 - 77:21)
we laid off 200 people also you&#39;re not (77:19 - 77:23)
getting your game for six more months um (77:21 - 77:26)
sorry (77:23 - 77:26)
uh they when I went to very very (77:28 - 77:33)
spaceship&#39;s website they also it looks (77:31 - 77:35)
like they also did stuff they&#39;re making (77:33 - 77:37)
their own (77:35 - 77:39)
game uh they have their own game they&#39;re (77:37 - 77:42)
working on uh they were doing stuff for (77:39 - 77:44)
Transformers heavy metal which was (77:42 - 77:48)
cancelled by Niantic that being said (77:44 - 77:50)
from my understanding Greg can correct (77:48 - 77:53)
me if I&#39;m wrong or Hannah can but when a (77:50 - 77:55)
company like Niantic hires another (77:53 - 77:57)
company to do stuff whether or not that (77:55 - 77:59)
project gets cancelled that company is (77:57 - 78:02)
still getting paid like you&#39;re still (77:59 - 78:04)
like (78:02 - 78:08)
paying it it strongly depends on the (78:04 - 78:13)
contract um a lot of companies (78:08 - 78:13)
will not pay or make a contract that (78:16 - 78:23)
payment is subject to (78:20 - 78:26)
completion and that if either party (78:23 - 78:28)
cancels that that is the end of that (78:26 - 78:30)
contract and they&#39;ll pay out a small (78:28 - 78:34)
portion of it it really strong like (78:30 - 78:36)
there&#39;s a lot of what goes into those (78:34 - 78:37)
contracts it (78:36 - 78:41)
is it is rare that a company is willing (78:37 - 78:44)
to pay all of the (78:41 - 78:48)
money to to just to say hey we promised (78:44 - 78:50)
that you&#39;re going to make something you (78:48 - 78:52)
didn&#39;t are bad they will build they (78:50 - 78:54)
build in a lot of back doors to be like (78:52 - 78:55)
well it was can (78:54 - 78:58)
and so since the product that this (78:55 - 79:01)
contract is for is no longer moving (78:58 - 79:05)
forward contract is null and void um (79:01 - 79:08)
usually that will go into litigation and (79:05 - 79:09)
they&#39;ll settle for some amount outside (79:08 - 79:14)
of court but that will ultimately affect (79:09 - 79:16)
employees because the expected money (79:14 - 79:18)
coming in means that they aren&#39;t hitting (79:16 - 79:21)
their budgets so then they will lay (79:18 - 79:22)
people off because they no longer have (79:21 - 79:24)
the budget to carry forward it gets (79:22 - 79:29)
really messy real real fast um but yeah (79:24 - 79:33)
generally if something gets cancelled uh (79:29 - 79:35)
most likely you&#39;re not (79:33 - 79:36)
getting (79:35 - 79:39)
anything uh and depending on how you (79:36 - 79:41)
wrote that contract you may have done (79:39 - 79:44)
work that they&#39;re like cool you did that (79:41 - 79:46)
on your own time uh we&#39;re out because (79:44 - 79:48)
we&#39;re not going to pay for it because we (79:46 - 79:50)
have no use for (79:48 - 79:50)
it it&#39;s bad the tech industry layoff are (79:51 - 79:58)
always so bad it&#39;s so hard yeah very (79:55 - 80:00)
very spaceship says Transformers heavy (79:58 - 80:02)
metal a full scale geolocated game Heavy (80:00 - 80:04)
Metal includes a brand new AR experience (80:02 - 80:06)
with lifetime life-size Transformers as (80:04 - 80:09)
well as 45 original characters this was (80:06 - 80:13)
cancelled um by Niantic not but we don&#39;t (80:09 - 80:17)
know how much like what was very very (80:13 - 80:21)
SPAC doing for that but what also can (80:17 - 80:24)
happen sorry what also can happen is (80:21 - 80:26)
that they could also (80:24 - 80:28)
retain everything that they made and (80:26 - 80:30)
decide well we&#39;ll switch it into our own (80:28 - 80:33)
game so Niantic can no longer claim (80:30 - 80:35)
anything that they were working on (80:33 - 80:37)
because they canceled the project so (80:35 - 80:39)
depending on the wording of the contract (80:37 - 80:41)
all of those rights and assets May (80:39 - 80:43)
revert back to very very and then they (80:41 - 80:46)
can do with it whatever they want it (80:43 - 80:49)
really depends on what that contract (80:46 - 80:53)
said also Hasbro was also somehow (80:49 - 80:55)
involved in that also yeah so was like (80:53 - 80:58)
Hasbro playing paying very very (80:55 - 81:02)
spaceship was Niantic paying them like (80:58 - 81:04)
how many people were was it like five (81:02 - 81:06)
people was it 10 people was it 50 people (81:04 - 81:09)
when this project (81:06 - 81:14)
cancelled where did those people go (81:09 - 81:14)
yeah (81:14 - 81:18)
um they work on poke they worked on (81:16 - 81:20)
Pokemon (81:18 - 81:24)
go uh the Pokémon go has less it says (81:20 - 81:25)
very very spacious is currently (81:24 - 81:27)
developing tent pole features for (81:25 - 81:30)
Pokémon go that is the biggest buzzword (81:27 - 81:32)
I&#39;ve ever heard (81:30 - 81:35)
um that affect the entire player base (81:32 - 81:36)
from the very first minutes a player (81:35 - 81:38)
spends in the game to trainers with a (81:36 - 81:40)
thousand hours of play we are excited to (81:38 - 81:43)
share more soon which sure sounds like (81:40 - 81:44)
the Character (81:43 - 81:47)
Creator and then they were working on (81:44 - 81:51)
emerging technology for Microsoft Google (81:47 - 81:55)
and Niantic we produced 12 game (81:51 - 81:57)
prototypes for (81:55 - 81:59)
Google uh during the de their (81:57 - 82:02)
development of AR core we launched four (81:59 - 82:04)
games for Microsoft&#39;s faster than light (82:02 - 82:06)
low latency streaming protocol and we (82:04 - 82:09)
collaborated with Niantic on their light (82:06 - 82:11)
ship platform which I think we&#39;ve talked (82:09 - 82:15)
about that on the show (82:11 - 82:15)
um so they didn&#39;t say how many people (82:15 - 82:20)
were laid off I think the people they (82:19 - 82:22)
reported that laid off were they just (82:20 - 82:27)
found out because of their LinkedIn m (82:22 - 82:27)
mhm I would suspect that this has (82:27 - 82:33)
nothing to do with recent character (82:30 - 82:37)
development drama I just way too (82:33 - 82:41)
soon to me it would be like well we&#39;re (82:37 - 82:43)
done with this (82:41 - 82:45)
project or this was the this was the (82:43 - 82:47)
deadline of the project and everyone (82:45 - 82:50)
else is doing layoffs and we don&#39;t like (82:47 - 82:51)
it could be possible that Niantic was (82:50 - 82:53)
like okay we want you to spend six (82:51 - 82:55)
months on this but we have nothing for (82:53 - 82:57)
you after this maybe we will but right (82:55 - 83:00)
like that day and time came there was no (82:57 - 83:03)
new offer from Niantic and they were (83:00 - 83:04)
like what are we going to do with these (83:03 - 83:05)
people yeah are we just gonna have them (83:04 - 83:07)
sit around for a month and hope that (83:05 - 83:11)
Niantic sends us something (83:07 - 83:15)
like they&#39;re not niantic&#39;s (83:11 - 83:19)
employees so it&#39;s not really niantic&#39;s (83:15 - 83:22)
fault that they didn&#39;t secure I I it (83:19 - 83:23)
sounds like I&#39;m defending n think I&#39;m (83:22 - 83:25)
not (83:23 - 83:27)
I mean they probably hired with the (83:25 - 83:29)
assumption that those other projects (83:27 - 83:32)
were going forward and then as a stop (83:29 - 83:34)
Gap measure when those were done they (83:32 - 83:37)
put everybody into the Go stuff to get (83:34 - 83:42)
it delivered hoping that there would be (83:37 - 83:45)
a followup that probably never came and (83:42 - 83:48)
then they were just like okay well we H (83:45 - 83:51)
we can&#39;t keep this amount of (83:48 - 83:51)
staff yeah I just I just can&#39;t I can&#39;t (83:53 - 83:57)
imagine it was like oh man look at this (83:55 - 84:00)
Twitter drama uh start laying people off (83:57 - 84:01)
yeah (84:00 - 84:04)
[Laughter] (84:01 - 84:07)
no (84:04 - 84:11)
uh I guess it it is it is surprising to (84:07 - 84:14)
again I think the the the news here was (84:11 - 84:16)
I thought this was done inhouse I (84:14 - 84:19)
thought like like when I think of like (84:16 - 84:22)
the Mega Evolution like I literally met (84:19 - 84:26)
the the woman in St Louis who worked on (84:22 - 84:29)
the Mega Evolution stuff she was awesome (84:26 - 84:30)
she was there with her husband who I (84:29 - 84:33)
think also worked at Niantic or used to (84:30 - 84:35)
work at Niantic and they were telling me (84:33 - 84:37)
how they like spent like a year and a (84:35 - 84:39)
half on it and they were so happy when (84:37 - 84:41)
it launched they were really proud of it (84:39 - 84:43)
and they were they were so excited to (84:41 - 84:46)
see how trainers were happy with how (84:43 - 84:47)
they (84:46 - 84:49)
revamped so I (84:47 - 84:51)
just would assume that there was like a (84:49 - 84:53)
team of like five to 10 people inside (84:51 - 84:55)
Niantic working (84:53 - 84:58)
on this character (84:55 - 85:00)
revamp I mean I would have assumed that (84:58 - 85:02)
their light ship program was also fully (85:00 - 85:06)
Niantic but I guess not (85:02 - 85:11)
so it&#39;s probably a mix in the team that (85:06 - 85:13)
worked on these things of Niantic people (85:11 - 85:15)
and people from very very would be my (85:13 - 85:19)
guess just based on my experiences but (85:15 - 85:23)
we don&#39;t know yeah I feel like (85:19 - 85:26)
it&#39;s when I think of layoffs of like we (85:23 - 85:28)
need to cut people to maximize our (85:26 - 85:31)
profits because corporate (85:28 - 85:31)
greed I I guess it would be cheaper to (85:33 - 85:39)
be like we&#39;ll hire this studio yeah (85:36 - 85:41)
you&#39;re responsible (85:39 - 85:44)
for for healthc care you&#39;re responsible (85:41 - 85:45)
for (85:44 - 85:48)
vacation here&#39;s your budget we&#39;re giving (85:45 - 85:49)
you I don&#39;t know we&#39;re giving you (85:48 - 85:52)
$20,000 for five employees for six (85:49 - 85:53)
months you figure out how to give that (85:52 - 85:55)
to your employees give us a product at (85:53 - 86:00)
the end I&#39;m so I used to work (85:55 - 86:03)
with contractors for a very very very (86:00 - 86:06)
large company (86:03 - 86:06)
and generally Contracting out is more (86:08 - 86:18)
expensive than hiring in the issue (86:13 - 86:22)
becomes once you&#39;ve hired them (86:18 - 86:25)
in you have to go through the bad p of (86:22 - 86:28)
laying them off when you don&#39;t need them (86:25 - 86:32)
so a lot of companies pay more for (86:28 - 86:35)
contractors to be able to cut them off (86:32 - 86:38)
completely and say you&#39;re no longer our (86:35 - 86:41)
issue the amount of money that you pay (86:38 - 86:45)
for contractors is almost always way (86:41 - 86:49)
more than hiring somebody in um healthc (86:45 - 86:51)
care and all of that included it&#39;s just (86:49 - 86:54)
easier to sever ties (86:51 - 86:57)
with another company and have it not be (86:54 - 87:01)
your PR and not be your business um we (86:57 - 87:06)
had I mean I had a project that did not (87:01 - 87:09)
happen because they could not find an (87:06 - 87:12)
agreeable price that the contractors (87:09 - 87:14)
would accept that amount of work like (87:12 - 87:17)
they were trying to to be way under and (87:14 - 87:19)
they&#39;re like we&#39;re not taking on that (87:17 - 87:23)
work for that price like we&#39;re just not (87:19 - 87:24)
we have to do all of the training (87:23 - 87:26)
inhouse we have to do all the things for (87:24 - 87:29)
this yeah I mean here&#39;s our bottom level (87:26 - 87:31)
they still have to be making money for (87:29 - 87:33)
their company as well correct that&#39;s the (87:31 - 87:36)
there&#39;s a middleman there so the (87:33 - 87:40)
Contracting Biz allows (87:36 - 87:43)
them more freedom it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t (87:40 - 87:47)
it rarely saves them money as far as (87:43 - 87:50)
costs are but it saves them headaches a (87:47 - 87:52)
lot of other ways a lot of the time at (87:50 - 87:54)
least I mean this doesn&#39;t seem to have (87:52 - 87:58)
separated Niantic from the bad (87:54 - 87:58)
press no I mean so Niantic is coming off (87:58 - 88:05)
of heels of also doing their own (88:02 - 88:08)
layoffs like when all these companies (88:05 - 88:10)
are compounding on each other where it&#39;s (88:08 - 88:12)
like you can sort of see all the (88:10 - 88:15)
dominoes fall over everybody&#39;s going to (88:12 - 88:20)
get hit in that and most most people in (88:15 - 88:21)
the (88:20 - 88:25)
past never knew what contractors were or (88:21 - 88:28)
who was working with whom so we have a (88:25 - 88:33)
new era of information where we can (88:28 - 88:35)
track down on things like LinkedIn that (88:33 - 88:37)
I did this project and I worked for (88:35 - 88:39)
these things especially (88:37 - 88:42)
since they have now taken steps to (88:39 - 88:46)
eliminate ndas so like before you (88:42 - 88:48)
couldn&#39;t talk about it at all and they (88:46 - 88:50)
are now swinging towards workers right (88:48 - 88:52)
saying if you worked on something it&#39;s (88:50 - 88:55)
basically illegal to to tell somebody (88:52 - 88:57)
they can&#39;t talk about their work (88:55 - 88:59)
experience um so we are finding these (88:57 - 89:03)
things out a lot more like if it wasn&#39;t (88:59 - 89:05)
for LinkedIn we would have never have (89:03 - 89:07)
known this and because of the end of (89:05 - 89:10)
ndas people on LinkedIn can say I worked (89:07 - 89:12)
on this I&#39;m proud I&#39;m looking for a new (89:10 - 89:15)
job and suddenly we are able to see (89:12 - 89:17)
paths that we never saw (89:15 - 89:22)
before I knew a bunch of people who (89:17 - 89:26)
worked on the translation from Japanese (89:22 - 89:28)
to English for Sun and (89:26 - 89:31)
Moon uh they reached they I I met them (89:28 - 89:34)
in person when I went to PA I&#39;m not (89:31 - 89:35)
going to say how many or who they were (89:34 - 89:38)
uh they told me they loveed the show (89:35 - 89:40)
that I had a couple people reach out and (89:38 - 89:42)
been like you speculate on this and (89:40 - 89:44)
you&#39;re you&#39;re right like that&#39;s going to (89:42 - 89:47)
happen it was like cool it was cool it (89:44 - 89:49)
was cool and then I found out like I (89:47 - 89:50)
because they I just assumed they were (89:49 - 89:52)
Nintendo employees because they were (89:50 - 89:55)
like we&#39;re We&#39;re translating the game (89:52 - 89:56)
found out that almost every single (89:55 - 89:59)
translator for Nintendo all contract (89:56 - 90:01)
they are contracted to translate (89:59 - 90:04)
specific games if there&#39;s not a game (90:01 - 90:06)
down the pipeline or (90:04 - 90:08)
like then they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re cut (90:06 - 90:12)
they&#39;re done they no longer have a job (90:08 - 90:15)
and I watched the same (90:12 - 90:18)
people get they they were translating (90:15 - 90:20)
for Sun and Moon all of a sudden they (90:18 - 90:22)
didn&#39;t have a job all of a sudden like (90:20 - 90:23)
six months later they were translating (90:22 - 90:25)
for (90:23 - 90:28)
at Luigi&#39;s Mansion all then all of a (90:25 - 90:31)
sudden they didn&#39;t have a job again yeah (90:28 - 90:35)
I mean when I didn&#39;t have a job um one (90:31 - 90:37)
of my Avenues was Contracting because I (90:35 - 90:40)
could have made a lot of a lot more (90:37 - 90:44)
money Contracting doing what I do but (90:40 - 90:46)
the flip side of that was also every (90:44 - 90:48)
year I would have to look for a new (90:46 - 90:50)
employer right like I would be laid off (90:48 - 90:52)
at the end (90:50 - 90:54)
of every six months or every year and (90:52 - 90:56)
that&#39;s not a life that I want to live (90:54 - 91:01)
but the money hands down is a lot more (90:56 - 91:03)
than a permanent salary like I could (91:01 - 91:06)
have made three figures Contracting in a (91:03 - 91:07)
lot of these places but it would have (91:06 - 91:10)
been for six months um and that is (91:07 - 91:12)
pretty common in how Contracting works (91:10 - 91:13)
like you can make a lot of money but (91:12 - 91:15)
you&#39;re on your own when that project (91:13 - 91:18)
ends and figure it (91:15 - 91:21)
out I would also assume like a Pokemon (91:18 - 91:22)
game (91:21 - 91:27)
needs so many more contractors than like (91:22 - 91:29)
like a single player Mario game right (91:27 - 91:32)
there&#39;s just so much dialogue in a (91:29 - 91:36)
Pokemon game compared to just like a 20 (91:32 - 91:40)
hour story based game um so it&#39;s like (91:36 - 91:42)
even if you had like I don&#39;t know 40 (91:40 - 91:43)
people translating sun and moon and like (91:42 - 91:46)
the next Nintendo game was like (91:43 - 91:49)
Pikman we only need 10 like what are we (91:46 - 91:53)
going to do with these other 30 (91:49 - 91:53)
people that would be (91:53 - 92:00)
might uh yeah so the very very spaceship (91:55 - 92:04)
stuff didn&#39;t seem like it went too (92:00 - 92:08)
far into like kind of kind of a deeper (92:04 - 92:11)
dive kind of thing but again I think (92:08 - 92:13)
interesting that Niantic was working (92:11 - 92:16)
with the studio for multiple things of (92:13 - 92:17)
the Transformer stuff if you actually go (92:16 - 92:20)
to the website you can see like video (92:17 - 92:22)
footage of the Transformer stuff it (92:20 - 92:23)
looks actually kind I I don&#39;t even like (92:22 - 92:25)
Transformer but like watching the (92:23 - 92:26)
animations and stuff I was like wow this (92:25 - 92:28)
looks really good again I thought that (92:26 - 92:31)
was like done all inous by (92:28 - 92:34)
Niantic (92:31 - 92:34)
but I&#39;m kind of starting to think maybe (92:34 - 92:38)
nanic is bad at making games and they&#39;re (92:36 - 92:41)
just very good at like maybe getting (92:38 - 92:43)
other people to make their (92:41 - 92:47)
games no comment unsure unsure yet I&#39;ve (92:43 - 92:49)
been playing Pokemon go for eight years (92:47 - 92:55)
I think I like it don&#39;t com it (92:49 - 92:58)
I&#39;m going to Japan to play Pokemon go I (92:55 - 93:00)
think I like (92:58 - 93:02)
it not just Japan (93:00 - 93:05)

medium and it&#39;s fairly big for a medium (93:50 - 93:56)
Oh I (93:54 - 93:57)
thought I was going to say you look (93:56 - 94:00)
you&#39;re looking ripped in that shirt well (93:57 - 94:02)
that&#39;s the (94:00 - 94:06)
point my back&#39;s caliber (94:02 - 94:06)
rep um that&#39;s all I got for today&#39;s show (94:07 - 94:11)
you guys got anything else before we end (94:09 - 94:14)
uh I did a draft finally in unite and it (94:11 - 94:15)
was fun but (94:14 - 94:18)
weird fun but you banned four Pokemon I (94:15 - 94:20)
didn&#39;t realize you banned four I thought (94:18 - 94:23)
you banned two you banned four that&#39;s (94:20 - 94:26)
why you have to have 14 you the only (94:23 - 94:27)
reason I would (94:26 - 94:29)
draft and then everyone picks their own (94:27 - 94:32)
I&#39;m like dang and all EXs are banned (94:29 - 94:33)
this season I&#39;m like I don&#39;t know if I (94:32 - 94:34)
have enough (94:33 - 94:37)
licenses and failinks rocks everybody (94:34 - 94:39)
should just go play failinks because (94:37 - 94:41)
it&#39;s (94:39 - 94:41)
awesome cool uh it is May 5th in the (94:42 - 94:47)
morning when we&#39;re recording that it is (94:45 - 94:49)
very possible that tonight they announce (94:47 - 94:53)
a sevenstar raid um because it has been (94:49 - 94:56)
a while it&#39;s been unusually long for a (94:53 - 94:58)
sevenstar raid uh so if they do announce (94:56 - 95:00)
a seven star raid I will be making raid (94:58 - 95:03)
Builds on Twitch on Monday night and (95:00 - 95:06)
