Pokemon company hating me and releasing (1:08 - 1:13)
more products that I have to buy um so (1:10 - 1:17)
that's this episode uh let's start off (1:13 - 1:20)
with Pokemon sleep Hannah gave up on it (1:17 - 1:23)
she's done I did not good job (1:20 - 1:26)
congratulations you're free (1:23 - 1:29)
hooray I've picked it back up this week (1:26 - 1:31)
I have come on my Pokémon at least once (1:29 - 1:34)
per day every day this week and I don't (1:31 - 1:37)
think I've missed a sleep day either all (1:34 - 1:39)
right but I did realize I did realize (1:37 - 1:42)
why I don't I I realized why it's (1:39 - 1:44)
falling off for me I realized the one (1:42 - 1:46)
thing that is just keeping me from (1:44 - 1:49)
getting into it every week I wish that (1:46 - 1:51)
we were actually able (1:49 - 1:55)
to choose the island ahead of time like (1:51 - 1:58)
on a Sunday and know what food and what (1:55 - 1:59)
berries you were going to be using for (1:58 - 2:02)
the next week because every time it goes (1:59 - 2:04)
into a Monday and I choose an island and (2:02 - 2:06)
then it gets halfway through the day (2:04 - 2:08)
before I can plan out a full team for (2:06 - 2:10)
the new island I feel like I've lost (2:08 - 2:13)
time with a nonoptimized (2:10 - 2:16)
team and then it just continues being (2:13 - 2:18)
more time with a non-optimized team (2:16 - 2:20)
because I've already lost that time and (2:18 - 2:24)
why why why should I fix my team if I've (2:20 - 2:25)
already lost the (2:24 - 2:29)
time hey you don't let let your team (2:25 - 2:32)
just be suboptimal let let follow what (2:29 - 2:34)
your heart says like I had a Shiny (2:32 - 2:37)
Gastly I made it a Shiny Gengar does it (2:34 - 2:40)
work heck no do I have it out so I can (2:37 - 2:44)
watch him walk around going absolutely I (2:40 - 2:50)
just aely plan yes it's a bad shiny well (2:44 - 2:54)
like um like snow drop and the beach and (2:50 - 2:56)
the berries are all set but the meal (2:54 - 2:58)
types aren't yeah oh yeah okay I see (2:56 - 2:59)
what you're saying I see what you're (2:58 - 3:03)
saying um I wonder if like cuz that is (2:59 - 3:05)
like both a bummer and exciting for me (3:03 - 3:07)
on Monday to be like okay where are we (3:05 - 3:09)
going What Pokemon do I need to switch (3:07 - 3:12)
out am I leveling up anything but it is (3:09 - 3:13)
like that first meal you're like oh (3:12 - 3:15)
nothing is optimized because I'm still (3:13 - 3:17)
in the process of switching makes me (3:15 - 3:20)
feel like I'm already behind I do wonder (3:17 - 3:21)
if like there are people who are like (3:20 - 3:23)
this is my beach team and I'm going to (3:21 - 3:24)
the beach next week and so I'm going to (3:23 - 3:26)
change it Sunday night before I go to (3:24 - 3:28)
bed so then when I wake up the beach (3:26 - 3:30)
team is like ready to go because after (3:28 - 3:33)
your final meal you don't really need (3:30 - 3:35)
anything anymore you don't but I feel (3:33 - 3:36)
like it's better to change it in the (3:35 - 3:38)
morning of Monday I just want to be able (3:36 - 3:41)
to have a team ready for that so that (3:38 - 3:43)
your last team is all rested and fresh (3:41 - 3:45)
HP and you can put them in the box all (3:43 - 3:49)
healthy instead of all (3:45 - 3:49)
drained I just like it the fact that (3:50 - 3:55)
everybody now gets a drink or a dessert (3:52 - 3:56)
when I make it I'm making it for (3:55 - 3:59)
everybody on the field I feel better (3:56 - 4:01)
about this process instead of I'm just (3:59 - 4:02)
feeding one and the rest of those poor (4:01 - 4:05)
suckers I'm stealing berries (4:02 - 4:08)
from yeah the little drink animation or (4:05 - 4:10)
meal animation they added was very cute (4:08 - 4:13)
they added that with lapis (4:10 - 4:15)
um (4:13 - 4:17)
neum there was a there was a couple (4:15 - 4:18)
updates that happened they added that (4:17 - 4:20)
new animation they made the fan speed (4:18 - 4:23)
faster when you're you're Fanning well (4:20 - 4:24)
the fan speed does not increase your (4:23 - 4:26)
lucky chance just still put that fan (4:24 - 4:28)
that does nothing I still hit it though (4:26 - 4:31)
because I like making it Jitter uh I I (4:28 - 4:33)
still hit it as well um they increased (4:31 - 4:36)
the bonus for each island so you could (4:33 - 4:38)
only go up to 50% bonus but now with (4:36 - 4:40)
lapis I believe you can go up to 55% for (4:38 - 4:43)
each um that's not any of the news (4:40 - 4:44)
because that was just stuff they did (4:43 - 4:47)
with the update Pokemon sleeve gets (4:44 - 4:48)
updated more than scarlet and violet (4:47 - 4:52)
which is pretty crazy uh they did add (4:48 - 4:55)
Stuffle Ralts and Dratini and so there's (4:52 - 4:57)
one more week of that before they (4:55 - 5:01)
permanently move to lapis for good (4:57 - 5:04)
uh but I went to Green Grass because I (5:01 - 5:06)
didn't have lapis unlocked I need like (5:04 - 5:09)
15 more Pokemon for lapis at this (5:06 - 5:13)
point uh but after so when you're (5:09 - 5:14)
listening to this there should be one (5:13 - 5:16)
more week of the lapis event I don't (5:14 - 5:17)
know why they decided the lapis event (5:16 - 5:19)
was like two weeks long like I'm not (5:17 - 5:21)
complaining it's like cool cuz like yeah (5:19 - 5:24)
sure give me they may be learning that (5:21 - 5:26)
people play more when there is an event (5:24 - 5:28)
happening it seems like right now (5:26 - 5:30)
they're trying to keep a con event (5:28 - 5:33)
happening kind of like go I wonder if (5:30 - 5:35)
they knew that like there was a big (5:33 - 5:37)
subset of people that were very close to (5:35 - 5:40)
lapis so this event for week one was (5:37 - 5:42)
like okay you can finish off you need (5:40 - 5:45)
like four more then the next week you'll (5:42 - 5:47)
be able to go to lapis I wonder yeah I (5:45 - 5:49)
don't know I don't know how many people (5:47 - 5:52)
are like like my highest level Pokemon I (5:49 - 5:54)
think is like (5:52 - 5:54)
38 I guess I could probably bring him up (5:55 - 6:01)
to like 46 but but there's really not a (5:58 - 6:04)
point because it's not 50 yet I don't (6:01 - 6:05)
know when I give Pokemon rare candy I (6:04 - 6:08)
like to give it candy to the point where (6:05 - 6:10)
it gets something yeah where it gets (6:08 - 6:13)
another skill or another unlock yeah I (6:10 - 6:17)
don't know if that's optimal or not but (6:13 - 6:21)
anyways Valentine's Day event Monday the (6:17 - 6:23)
12th this might seem like one of the (6:21 - 6:25)
better events they've ever done one of (6:23 - 6:28)
the best events we could say it's it's (6:25 - 6:30)
little young to say best it's been about (6:28 - 6:34)
like a half a year I just got Char I (6:30 - 6:37)
just got charged my $50 this morning (6:34 - 6:40)
Greg for another six months of this (6:37 - 6:42)
game how (6:40 - 6:45)
much it's $10 a month but if you do all (6:42 - 6:48)
six months you save (6:45 - 6:48)
$10 we've talked about that I know I (6:49 - 6:55)
just don't (6:53 - 7:02)
understand why for for 12 95 a month you (6:55 - 7:04)
can get a full (7:02 - 7:09)
MMO that has a ton of content in it can (7:04 - 7:12)
I give them aeral Donuts though I don't (7:09 - 7:14)
think so yeah well you can give certain (7:12 - 7:16)
things Donuts cuz cuz you know there's (7:14 - 7:18)
farming in Final Fantasy 14 now so (7:16 - 7:20)
that's true there's fishing too there's (7:18 - 7:23)
fishing there's farming there's sleeping (7:20 - 7:26)
I have a house (7:23 - 7:26)
now uh Valentine's Day will be a week (7:26 - 7:33)
long Snorlax will be set to dessert and (7:30 - 7:35)
drinks uh for the entire time and the (7:33 - 7:38)
dish value will be multiplied by 1.5 the (7:35 - 7:42)
entire week uh the multiplier for extra (7:38 - 7:43)
tasty will be different depending on the (7:42 - 7:46)
day on Sunday extra tasty will be four (7:43 - 7:48)
point times as much strength the other (7:46 - 7:51)
days it will give you three times so I (7:48 - 7:53)
think uh how people figured it out was (7:51 - 7:55)
the little it's the critical hit to get (7:53 - 7:59)
like the extra tasty it's 10% Monday (7:55 - 8:01)
through Saturday and then on Sunday it's (7:59 - 8:03)
30% believe that's how it works for me (8:01 - 8:07)
it's 0% constantly yep uh same I get it (8:03 - 8:10)
once every two weeks maybe how how are (8:07 - 8:14)
you both so into this game and so bad at (8:10 - 8:16)
this game I have shiny this game money I (8:14 - 8:19)
feel like I should have tast all I think (8:16 - 8:21)
it knows that I don't care it's like a (8:19 - 8:25)
cat knows person that does not want it (8:21 - 8:27)
will come over sleep is like this person (8:25 - 8:31)
does not care make make it happen make (8:27 - 8:33)
it rain over there try to get interested (8:31 - 8:36)
I'm like I hit the button and look at my (8:33 - 8:37)
pretty people friends walking around (8:36 - 8:39)
they're (8:37 - 8:41)
shiny they're like if we keep giving (8:39 - 8:43)
critical hit maybe Greg will check the (8:41 - 8:48)
store out more often I forget the store (8:43 - 8:51)
exists do a really good daily free item (8:48 - 8:53)
now though yeah I know but I forget I'm (8:51 - 8:55)
like oh oh my gosh the item is good it's (8:53 - 8:58)
usually H in there well whatever the (8:55 - 8:59)
only like bad I feel like the bad thing (8:58 - 9:00)
thing that you get in the item is the (8:59 - 9:03)
pillow I never use the pillow because I (9:00 - 9:05)
always have Wigglytuff so Wigglytuff is (9:03 - 9:09)
already keeping everyone healthy Fair my (9:05 - 9:11)
my S my S rank Wiggly tff that the (9:09 - 9:15)
calculator said uh okay (9:11 - 9:18)
so to get it to the S rank yeah yeah (9:15 - 9:20)
yeah yeah yeah because I I'm in the (9:18 - 9:23)
premium store so I get yes you can buy (9:20 - 9:26)
them buy them with my points I just do (9:23 - 9:27)
srank (9:26 - 9:30)
sleep I've got srank sleep before once I (9:27 - 9:33)
switched to my new method of sleeping uh (9:30 - 9:36)
okay it's not cheating it's just telling (9:33 - 9:39)
it just telling it I'm going to bed at (9:36 - 9:41)
3:00 a.m. whether I'm going to bed or (9:39 - 9:44)
not I am in the (9:41 - 9:48)
bed I'm just not sleeping sleeping uh (9:44 - 9:51)
okay so Bulbasaur Jigglypuff Slowpoke (9:48 - 9:54)
Pinsir Chikorita and absil will be (9:51 - 9:56)
boosted more likely to appear during (9:54 - 9:59)
this event also the they are saying (9:56 - 10:01)
saying that Shiny Bulbasaur Jigglypuff (9:59 - 10:04)
Slowpoke pins or Chikorita Absol will be (10:01 - 10:07)
boosted I don't know what the Boost is (10:04 - 10:10)
but we've we've had this before for the (10:07 - 10:14)
the the Pikachus and there was something (10:10 - 10:16)
else that was boosted at one (10:14 - 10:18)
point uh there will be limited time (10:16 - 10:20)
missions you can get up to 10 Pokey (10:18 - 10:21)
Biscuits by doing the missions there (10:20 - 10:24)
will be two new Desserts and Drinks (10:21 - 10:27)
added and there were some new desserts (10:24 - 10:29)
there were some new meals added with (10:27 - 10:32)
lapis because they added corn so I think (10:29 - 10:34)
like one of the desserts is like popcorn (10:32 - 10:38)
or something M but I think only Stuffle (10:34 - 10:40)
has (10:38 - 10:44)
corn drai Dratini does can Dratini can (10:40 - 10:46)
have corn okay okay I think for sure (10:44 - 10:48)
Stuffle starts with corn yes Stuffle is (10:46 - 10:50)
all (10:48 - 10:54)
corn all corn uh you can go to any area (10:50 - 10:55)
for the the shiny (10:54 - 10:59)
boosted uh event or the desserts or the (10:55 - 11:00)
drinks (10:59 - 11:03)
I will say off the top of my head all of (11:00 - 11:05)
these Pokemon appear on green (11:03 - 11:08)
grass so that's probably your best bet (11:05 - 11:10)
you could go to the beach but you don't (11:08 - 11:12)
you won't see (11:10 - 11:15)
Absol uh or Bulbasaur at all at the (11:12 - 11:17)
beach and for just don't go to top (11:15 - 11:19)
Hollow I know I personally hate Top (11:17 - 11:21)
Hollow but I think out of all of these (11:19 - 11:24)
Pokemon only Jigglypuff spawns at top (11:21 - 11:26)
Hollow so I don't know why you would (11:24 - 11:28)
consider that it is the worst Choice (11:26 - 11:32)
unless you really want the jiggly Puffs (11:28 - 11:37)
yeah and then for the snow drop I think (11:32 - 11:39)
that would be everything but no (11:37 - 11:42)
Bulbasaur or Chikorita on snow (11:39 - 11:46)
drop not P either just be Slowpoke (11:42 - 11:48)
Jigglypuff and (11:46 - 11:50)
Absol and then (11:48 - 11:53)
for lapis uh I know lapis is for sure (11:50 - 11:55)
Bulbasaur and for sure Chikorita but I (11:53 - 11:58)
don't think Absol is there and I don't (11:55 - 12:00)
think Jigglypuff is there (11:58 - 12:02)
Jigglypuff is there sorry I have a (12:00 - 12:05)
infographic up oh on the thing on the (12:02 - 12:09)
thing it's was that that (12:05 - 12:09)
bad I'm (12:09 - 12:14)
reading I dang I was doing pretty good (12:11 - 12:16)
off the top of my head honestly you were (12:14 - 12:17)
you were doing pretty good you were (12:16 - 12:19)
remembering almost all of them I was (12:17 - 12:20)
doing pretty good at the top of my head (12:19 - 12:22)
no there's a there I think I know what (12:20 - 12:23)
infographic you're looking at and it's (12:22 - 12:25)
really bad because they decided to shiny (12:23 - 12:27)
some of them and not and then in the in (12:25 - 12:29)
the comments they were like oh like like (12:27 - 12:31)
all the comments were like oh so the (12:29 - 12:33)
shiny odds for this is here and they're (12:31 - 12:34)
like no I just decided some were shiny (12:33 - 12:36)
and some were not I was like that's not (12:34 - 12:39)
a good infographic you can't just decide (12:36 - 12:42)
to make artistic (12:39 - 12:42)
choices sometimes he want style over (12:43 - 12:47)
substance laugh is Bulbasaur Jigglypuff (12:50 - 12:56)
Slowpoke Chikorita yes I haven't gotten (12:52 - 12:58)
a shiny in like four months and I give (12:56 - 13:01)
this game money so uh I have three (12:58 - 13:04)
shinies theti game in the last three (13:01 - 13:07)
weeks alone I got a shiny Togepi and (13:04 - 13:10)
shiny castley I'm telling you you two (13:07 - 13:13)
for for loving this game so much you are (13:10 - 13:15)
bad at it you are bad at this game I (13:13 - 13:19)
have 10 shinies don't tell (13:15 - 13:19)
me I got a shiny Pichu this week and Pik (13:20 - 13:27)
another (13:24 - 13:27)
$50 (13:28 - 13:31)
I will say to be fair I kind of forgot (13:30 - 13:33)
about the subscription until this (13:31 - 13:35)
morning when I checked my email the (13:33 - 13:38)
subscription does make a difference um (13:35 - 13:41)
and this event this uh Valentine's Day (13:38 - 13:43)
event is doing what I want being able to (13:41 - 13:45)
let people plan their teams out ahead of (13:43 - 13:47)
time because you know that the meal is (13:45 - 13:49)
going to be desserts and you know on (13:47 - 13:51)
most of the islands what the berries are (13:49 - 13:52)
going to be so unless you're going to (13:51 - 13:55)
Green Grass which I probably will (13:52 - 13:57)
because I'm not a high enough level for (13:55 - 13:59)
snow drop to be comfortable (13:57 - 14:02)
um you can plan out your team far ahead (13:59 - 14:05)
of time for this (14:02 - 14:08)
event and I think it's very (14:05 - 14:12)
exciting also I don't know if (14:08 - 14:16)
like I don't know if you're luck is (14:12 - 14:18)
better like maybe if you really wanted (14:16 - 14:20)
an abso and you're like I'm going to go (14:18 - 14:21)
to snow drop because it's either snow (14:20 - 14:23)
drop or green grass but I'm still (14:21 - 14:26)
assuming you have to be pretty high (14:23 - 14:28)
level to get the Absol to appear anyways (14:26 - 14:30)
like we saw the Eevee event oh yeah that (14:28 - 14:32)
was the other shiny boosted on was the (14:30 - 14:36)
Eevee like Vaporeon wasn't appearing on (14:32 - 14:37)
the beach until you were like Master (14:36 - 14:39)
four so like there were a lot of people (14:37 - 14:41)
that were like oh I never saw a Vaporeon (14:39 - 14:43)
and it was like yeah cuz you were Ultra (14:41 - 14:46)
five which like is whatever that's might (14:43 - 14:47)
that might be what you have but if you (14:46 - 14:49)
were going to that event being like Oh I (14:47 - 14:51)
want (14:49 - 14:52)
Vaporeon then you just didn't have a (14:51 - 14:53)
good enough team then you wouldn't have (14:52 - 14:56)
seen it yeah too low a level just stick (14:53 - 14:58)
to green (14:56 - 15:00)
grass (14:58 - 15:03)
uh yeah uh this this this event seems (15:00 - 15:06)
cool uh it's it's kind of crazy to go (15:03 - 15:09)
from two weeks of uh lapis event to and (15:06 - 15:13)
now a brand new week of sleep so um (15:09 - 15:17)
excited I think that's the week I'm yeah (15:13 - 15:20)
that is the week I'm traveling to La (15:17 - 15:22)
it's the Valentine's event so yeah so I (15:20 - 15:25)
think I I I I have to change my (15:22 - 15:31)
bedtime because 3:00 a.m. La is like 5 5 (15:25 - 15:34)
a.m. so I have to change it because I'm (15:31 - 15:35)
I'm probably not going to if I'm going (15:34 - 15:36)
to bed at 3:00 a.m. every night when I'm (15:35 - 15:39)
in La then I'm starting off real bad (15:36 - 15:41)
when it comes to walking around Pogo (15:39 - 15:44)
because I think that event starts at 10: (15:41 - 15:45)
a.m. or (15:44 - 15:49)
something so I need to change the the (15:45 - 15:54)
Bedtime uh okay our sleep segment (15:49 - 15:57)
is we we'll we'll we'll check back in (15:54 - 15:59)
next week uh for Sleep uh let let's talk (15:57 - 16:02)
about Pokémon go and then we'll take a (15:59 - 16:04)
break uh (16:02 - 16:07)
anoris actually this is really funny (16:04 - 16:09)
because we talked about last week how (16:07 - 16:11)
the only way to get an Amorous is to (16:09 - 16:14)
spend $60 and then transfer it into (16:11 - 16:16)
scarlet and violet and play a whole lot (16:14 - 16:20)
of that game yeah play yeah it's a good (16:16 - 16:24)
game though it is yeah no it's fun um I (16:20 - 16:25)
you know I've only played through it (16:24 - 16:27)
once and a half so I'd actually be (16:25 - 16:29)
curious two years later cuz now that (16:27 - 16:31)
game is 2 years old which is wild that (16:29 - 16:33)
that game is 2 years old I wonder how (16:31 - 16:35)
that game feels two years later because (16:33 - 16:38)
I haven't touched it in a long time um (16:35 - 16:41)
anyways anamoros is coming to Pokemon go (16:38 - 16:43)
it's coming in Elite raids which the (16:41 - 16:45)
last Elite raid this cat is get out of (16:43 - 16:47)
here uh (16:45 - 16:50)
this poor (16:47 - 16:54)
cat um the last Elite raids were Reggie (16:50 - 16:57)
Drago and Reggie Eli if I remember and (16:54 - 17:00)
then before that was Hoopa (16:57 - 17:02)
and Reggie Drago and Reggie Eli (17:00 - 17:04)
eventually moved (17:02 - 17:06)
into normal five-star raids if I (17:04 - 17:07)
remember (17:06 - 17:11)
correctly at some point they did so (17:07 - 17:13)
anamoros is coming it's debuting on (17:11 - 17:16)
Valentine's Day Elite raids are what (17:13 - 17:21)
replaced ex raids even though ex raids e (17:16 - 17:23)
ex gyms still exist in the game like in (17:21 - 17:25)
all America you can like see which like (17:23 - 17:28)
gyms are ex even though they have taken (17:25 - 17:30)
some of the things in the game for ex (17:28 - 17:33)
raids out though I think that the ex (17:30 - 17:36)
raid passes no longer exist in the (17:33 - 17:39)
game's code anymore oh okay okay well I (17:36 - 17:41)
wish Mall of America would get Elite (17:39 - 17:43)
raids because for some reason they don't (17:41 - 17:46)
they're not a park they're not a park (17:43 - 17:51)
that's right hey true at least it you (17:46 - 17:54)
could go to a park in Minnesota right (17:51 - 17:55)
now (17:54 - 17:57)
and I mean it's shorts weather let's (17:55 - 18:01)
let's be real yeah is WEA right now and (17:57 - 18:07)
it's supposed to be 50 on Tuesday so (18:01 - 18:07)
like we're we're we're changing we're (18:07 - 18:13)
changing the tune we can go to a park (18:10 - 18:16)
and be like I'm outside in February for (18:13 - 18:18)
the first time in seven months well the (18:16 - 18:21)
anoris raids are on Valentine's Day so (18:18 - 18:23)
it's a week from now and who knows what (18:21 - 18:25)
the weather will be doing a week and a (18:23 - 18:28)
half uh so yes enamoras will be set at (18:25 - 18:30)
four times on Valentine's Day on (18:28 - 18:33)
Wednesday so it'll appear at 12:00 1:00 (18:30 - 18:35)
5:00 and (18:33 - 18:38)
6:00 uh where local time wherever you (18:35 - 18:40)
are and then when you defeat an (18:38 - 18:43)
amoris uh certain Pokemon will spawn (18:40 - 18:45)
around that gym for 30 minutes I think (18:43 - 18:47)
they did this for Hoopa but they did not (18:45 - 18:50)
do this (18:47 - 18:53)
for uh Eli and Drago which was confusing (18:50 - 18:55)
because people were like oh I didn't get (18:53 - 18:57)
any spawns I can't remember what the (18:55 - 18:59)
bonus for Eli was (18:57 - 19:02)
because like ho do this for the (18:59 - 19:05)
reggies no because Hoopa had a chance (19:02 - 19:07)
for like Articuno zapto malra to spawn (19:05 - 19:09)
with the other oh you're thinking of (19:07 - 19:12)
super special spawns around it yeah no (19:09 - 19:14)
yeah they didn't do that for the reggies (19:12 - 19:17)
but what what's spawning around anoris (19:14 - 19:20)
is also not Articuno Zapdos Moltres yes (19:17 - 19:22)
it's not as good as that it's just a (19:20 - 19:24)
bunch of fairy Pokemon and a (19:22 - 19:27)
Taillow fairy and (19:24 - 19:30)
flying so you get Clefairy Jigglypuff (19:27 - 19:34)
snel taow wbat ulga rufflet flet (19:30 - 19:37)
Fletchling spritzy and swirlx all of (19:34 - 19:41)
those can be shiny except for a (19:37 - 19:41)
mulga get (19:41 - 19:48)
wga and you'll see 24 hours ahead of (19:44 - 19:51)
time where the eggs are hatching unless (19:48 - 19:54)
that breaks so put a big (19:51 - 19:56)
Aster it's been a while it's been a (19:54 - 20:00)
while since they didn't uh Elite raid (19:56 - 20:02)
things could have broken since then for (20:00 - 20:04)
sure there have been a lot of updates uh (20:02 - 20:06)
once the egg hatches uh the boss will be (20:04 - 20:09)
available for 30 minutes uh no remote (20:06 - 20:11)
raid passes got to be in (20:09 - 20:15)
person I'm sure if you miss this it will (20:11 - 20:16)
come (20:15 - 20:18)
back they did what Hoopa twice maybe (20:16 - 20:20)
even three times they did Reggie Eli (20:18 - 20:23)
Reggie Drago once or twice and then they (20:20 - 20:24)
put them in five stars at a certain (20:23 - 20:26)
point so that was I don't know the third (20:24 - 20:27)
time (20:26 - 20:29)
so (20:27 - 20:32)
I I think it's cute that the Pokemon (20:29 - 20:34)
that is pink with hearts on its snake (20:32 - 20:37)
around its neck and a heart on its horns (20:34 - 20:39)
is debuting on Valentine's Day I think (20:37 - 20:42)
that is thematic I understand the (20:39 - 20:44)
complaints that it's during a (20:42 - 20:46)
workday but if I'm gonna I here here's (20:44 - 20:50)
my soap box that I'm GNA stand on ever (20:46 - 20:52)
since for ever since I was like 14 years (20:50 - 20:55)
old and I was in my first relationship (20:52 - 20:58)
everyone your friends your peers your (20:55 - 21:00)
teachers your parents said that (20:58 - 21:02)
Valentine's Day was a garbage holiday (21:00 - 21:04)
and it was a corporate holiday and it (21:02 - 21:07)
was just to sell gift cards and to get (21:04 - 21:08)
you to go out to dinner to buy (21:07 - 21:10)
overpriced (21:08 - 21:12)
meals so don't I don't want to hear (21:10 - 21:14)
people complaining that it's ruining (21:12 - 21:16)
your overpriced Valentine's Day dinner (21:14 - 21:18)
it's not that big of a deal go to dinner (21:16 - 21:19)
on (21:18 - 21:22)
Friday Valentine's Day is a good holiday (21:19 - 21:24)
and I will stand up for it it's a (21:22 - 21:27)
corporate holiday it is important to be (21:24 - 21:30)
able to tell people you care about them (21:27 - 21:31)
I tell Greg I care about them every (21:30 - 21:34)
night before bed you do (21:31 - 21:38)
not you send me I hope you die in your (21:34 - 21:41)
sleep I sent you that good dog Tik Tock (21:38 - 21:42)
and I know you (21:41 - 21:44)
laughed yeah but I don't get those at (21:42 - 21:47)
night I get those in the morning well (21:44 - 21:49)
I'm sending up to you at night yeah I (21:47 - 21:51)
sending at 2: in the morning when I am (21:49 - 21:55)
dead to the world (21:51 - 21:59)
uh I am not I am not one that (21:55 - 22:03)
I like the idea of Valentine's Day (21:59 - 22:05)
although again much like New Year's (22:03 - 22:07)
resolutions you should be telling people (22:05 - 22:09)
that you care about them a lot more than (22:07 - 22:13)
one speci part set aside day like it (22:09 - 22:15)
should be more normalizing that the (22:13 - 22:17)
thing I don't like (22:15 - 22:22)
about Valentine's Day are people's (22:17 - 22:25)
judgments around what should happened (22:22 - 22:29)
and how you should be on Valentine's Day (22:25 - 22:31)
there are judgments if you have a (22:29 - 22:33)
partner and you're not doing something (22:31 - 22:35)
there is judgments if you're single (22:33 - 22:37)
there is judgments if you don't (22:35 - 22:40)
celebrate the holiday like there's so (22:37 - 22:43)
much weirdness around how people treat (22:40 - 22:44)
Valentine's Day and how people treat (22:43 - 22:46)
other people around Valentine's Day that (22:44 - 22:49)
I don't I don't care about it like my (22:46 - 22:54)
husband and I specifically do not count (22:49 - 22:56)
Valentine's Day although that was (22:54 - 22:58)
technically our first date it was a grou (22:56 - 23:00)
group date so it doesn't (22:58 - 23:03)
count I would have Valentine's Day date (23:00 - 23:05)
with seven people at that point it was (23:03 - 23:07)
the first time we went and hung out (23:05 - 23:09)
together so we don't count it because (23:07 - 23:11)
it's not really was a group date but (23:09 - 23:13)
there's just a lot of garbage judgments (23:11 - 23:15)
around (23:13 - 23:19)
Valentine's Day that I don't care (23:15 - 23:21)
for I don't think I've (23:19 - 23:24)
ever (23:21 - 23:26)
had maybe at some point maybe like 10 (23:24 - 23:28)
years ago I had dinner on Valentine's (23:26 - 23:31)
Day but like now it's like oh like let's (23:28 - 23:32)
go out for Valentine's Day dinner but (23:31 - 23:36)
let like let's do it like 5 days later (23:32 - 23:38)
yeah let's do it when it's convenient (23:36 - 23:43)
not on a Wednesday when it cost slightly (23:38 - 23:47)
less I don't know although when when the (23:43 - 23:50)
White Castle was doing the Valentine's (23:47 - 23:56)
Day D in make Ike one Greg I saw it yes (23:50 - 23:58)
Greg we can we go to can we go to White (23:56 - 24:00)
Castle for Valentine's (23:58 - 24:04)
Day I mean you mean Ikea or Ikea which (24:00 - 24:06)
either whichever one I think both of (24:04 - 24:09)
those sound (24:06 - 24:12)
awesome it's it's on a Wednesday I know (24:09 - 24:13)
I'm flying I'm flying on Wednesday (24:12 - 24:16)
that's what I leave for La it's on a (24:13 - 24:18)
Wednesday also I don't think our Ikea is (24:16 - 24:23)
doing the Valentine's Day dinner no but (24:18 - 24:24)
well may are they are I don't know (24:23 - 24:26)
anyways I had to listen to a whole spiel (24:24 - 24:28)
about how there's a popup I coming to (24:26 - 24:30)
Roseville from my mother-in-law today (24:28 - 24:34)
and I'm I'm so done with talking about (24:30 - 24:34)
Ika Oh I thought there was more there (24:36 - 24:41)
[Laughter] (24:39 - 24:45)
no this is I I will I will also stand on (24:41 - 24:47)
my soap box once again and I would I (24:45 - 24:50)
will say I like Elite raids a lot I like (24:47 - 24:53)
looking at campfire knowing where (24:50 - 24:55)
they're going to be which is usually the (24:53 - 24:57)
one park that we go to Greg I don't (24:55 - 24:59)
remember what it's called (24:57 - 25:00)
the the park (24:59 - 25:03)
in the yeah the park that we went to to (25:00 - 25:06)
do go Fest that one time Centennial (25:03 - 25:09)
Centennial yeah yeah yeah (25:06 - 25:13)
yeah I and I liked ex raids I liked (25:09 - 25:16)
being like Oh at 5 o'clock or six (25:13 - 25:18)
o'clock or one o'clock the one o'clock (25:16 - 25:20)
actually works better for me that you (25:18 - 25:22)
can go here other people will also know (25:20 - 25:25)
to go up here you just do it you don't (25:22 - 25:27)
talk to anyone you leave now I do know (25:25 - 25:29)
that like when I'm All America again (25:27 - 25:32)
privileged very beneficial best place (25:29 - 25:34)
indoor place to play that nine times out (25:32 - 25:36)
of 10 I can jump in any raid and it will (25:34 - 25:40)
fill uph but before that before I moved (25:36 - 25:42)
here when I was in Milwaukee it was like (25:40 - 25:44)
oh there's an ex raid at this park at (25:42 - 25:47)
this time show up people are there we do (25:44 - 25:50)
it we leave it's great I love it I think (25:47 - 25:54)
it's great I also work (25:50 - 25:56)
technically second and a half shift or (25:54 - 25:59)
whatever like I I work like 6:00 p.m. to (25:56 - 26:03)
well second shift is what 12 to 8 and (25:59 - 26:05)
then third shift is (26:03 - 26:07)
yeah second shift 12 to 8 I thought it (26:05 - 26:09)
was 1 to nine oh I think you're right I (26:07 - 26:11)
think it is 1 to nine and then third (26:09 - 26:15)
shift is what like 10 to six (26:11 - 26:15)
yeah um oh boy do according do indeed oh (26:15 - 26:22)
did they did they did the corporate (26:21 - 26:24)
overlords change (26:22 - 26:27)
it this is this is the weirdest thing (26:24 - 26:30)
I've ever read this C second shift hours (26:27 - 26:33)
are 5:00 P pm to 1:00 a.m I don't think (26:30 - 26:35)
that's right and then it (26:33 - 26:40)
says okay so it says first shift is 9 (26:35 - 26:43)
to5 second shift is 5 to one and third (26:40 - 26:46)
shift is midnight to 8: (26:43 - 26:49)
am that doesn't that doesn't sound right (26:46 - 26:52)
but I I mean it's like slightly kind of (26:49 - 26:56)
okay feels like it's pushed back too far (26:52 - 26:58)
whatever anyways anytime this says 3: (26:56 - 27:02)
p.m. to 11:00 p.m. it's all this is all (26:58 - 27:06)
made up mhm oh yeah uh anytime Elite AR (27:02 - 27:09)
raids get announced there's this wave of (27:06 - 27:12)
people who work 9 to5 that get so upset (27:09 - 27:16)
that there are slots at (27:12 - 27:16)
lunchtime when there are there there are (27:16 - 27:22)
there are times afterwards too like it's (27:19 - 27:24)
not only (27:22 - 27:26)
lunchtime also some people do go on (27:24 - 27:29)
their lunch like when I work at 5 I left (27:26 - 27:30)
the office I was like I'm not going to (27:29 - 27:34)
be here I'm going somewhere I do miss (27:30 - 27:36)
working downtown cuz on these there was (27:34 - 27:40)
a group of people who were playing for (27:36 - 27:41)
their (27:40 - 27:43)
kids when gosh that that that makes me (27:41 - 27:46)
more upset than the Valentine's Day (27:43 - 27:50)
people uh who were always oh so you can (27:46 - 27:53)
go walk around the skyways at lunch and (27:50 - 27:54)
then there would just be a group of (27:53 - 27:57)
people who were playing for their kids (27:54 - 27:58)
win (27:57 - 28:00)
uh and then you could just find a group (27:58 - 28:03)
although at the Heyday there was a (28:00 - 28:04)
couple people that were super annoying (28:03 - 28:06)
about it because they would be like (28:04 - 28:09)
we're dividing up a my team and intin (28:06 - 28:11)
over here and back back when they did (28:09 - 28:14)
that oh my gosh I'm not doing that that (28:11 - 28:17)
was so I will say they have changed the (28:14 - 28:19)
times a little bit for these Elite raids (28:17 - 28:21)
the other ones were on weekends and I (28:19 - 28:23)
don't think there was a 6 PM one before (28:21 - 28:26)
but there is (28:23 - 28:29)
now was wasn't there a three of them for (28:26 - 28:31)
yeah there was 11:00 a.m. 2 p.m. and (28:29 - 28:34)
5:00 p.m yeah oh I think this is better (28:31 - 28:36)
yes now there is a 6PM one that is (28:34 - 28:40)
solidly outside of the 9 (28:36 - 28:44)
to5 yeah let's be real it's 8 to5 like (28:40 - 28:46)
yeah yeah it is yeah I was gonna say it (28:44 - 28:48)
is technically 8 to five yeah plus (28:46 - 28:51)
commute time (28:48 - 28:55)
yeah uh if if I was going into the (28:51 - 28:58)
office I would be close to Centennial (28:55 - 29:02)
Park and I would go but I'm not so I'm (28:58 - 29:03)
not (29:02 - 29:06)
going I think if I wasn't traveling I (29:03 - 29:08)
would probably hit up all four just (29:06 - 29:11)
because I think anamor is cool and I (29:08 - 29:12)
would like to have more than just one (29:11 - 29:14)
without playing Legends again but I (29:12 - 29:17)
guess for well this is free minus the (29:14 - 29:19)
gas and the time but going through all (29:17 - 29:21)
of Legends to get another enamoras is a (29:19 - 29:25)
lot more work oh yeah but I'm sure I'm (29:21 - 29:28)
sure this will come back again obviously (29:25 - 29:31)
the to me it's it's not like I sometimes (29:28 - 29:32)
think that people like think Niantic is (29:31 - 29:34)
like trying to screw us over like like (29:32 - 29:37)
oh my gosh why I I work during the week (29:34 - 29:39)
I I can't go this and it's like they're (29:37 - 29:41)
just putting the Pokemon with a bunch of (29:39 - 29:43)
hearts on it to debut on Valentine's Day (29:41 - 29:45)
I don't think it's that malicious I (29:43 - 29:46)
think if anything it's just trying to be (29:45 - 29:47)
like (29:46 - 29:51)
cute like I think anoris will come back (29:47 - 29:52)
and it will probably come back on like a (29:51 - 29:54)
Saturday or a Sunday so it's really not (29:52 - 29:57)
that big of a deal I don't think so um (29:54 - 29:58)
there's but I understand there's like a (29:57 - 30:00)
fear of missing out uh if I wasn't (29:58 - 30:03)
flying I would probably do as many as as (30:00 - 30:07)
I could but um it's whatever and when it (30:03 - 30:09)
comes back it will probably be in normal (30:07 - 30:12)
raids because the only Elite raids they (30:09 - 30:14)
have repeated were the Reggie dragos (30:12 - 30:17)
because those broke badly and then they (30:14 - 30:19)
broke the second time too that's why (30:17 - 30:21)
they came back in normal (30:19 - 30:25)
raids yeah well the real news is is an (30:21 - 30:28)
amoris going to break or not yes (30:25 - 30:31)
uh apparently uh you could speedrun (30:28 - 30:35)
archus in four hours that's that yeah if (30:31 - 30:37)
you know the (30:35 - 30:39)
route (30:37 - 30:44)
well um I mean there's 4our raids four (30:39 - 30:46)
hours to play archus I think it's a (30:44 - 30:48)
equal oh that that would be a good (30:46 - 30:50)
Valentine's Day get your significant (30:48 - 30:52)
other sit in the car waiting for the (30:50 - 30:54)
elite Ray to start as you play archus as (30:52 - 30:58)
you play archus as you speed run archus (30:54 - 31:01)
um another small event is Pokemon Go's (30:58 - 31:05)
Carnival of Love is going to debut shiny (31:01 - 31:10)
ororo that will be Tuesday February 13th (31:05 - 31:11)
to Thursday February (31:10 - 31:14)
15th uh you will get increased XL candy (31:11 - 31:16)
walking with her (31:14 - 31:18)
buddy um furu will be able to be the (31:16 - 31:23)
heart trim furu if you have one of (31:18 - 31:27)
those uh there's the pom poms are not (31:23 - 31:30)
moving so America still has or sorry the (31:27 - 31:32)
or corers are not moving America will (31:30 - 31:34)
still have pom pom (31:32 - 31:39)
form uh and then fbe will appear as well (31:34 - 31:41)
or more frequently I guess technically (31:39 - 31:46)
so you have snub skdy love disk flbe (31:41 - 31:49)
depending on your region furu ororo (31:46 - 31:53)
depending on your region Stuffle and (31:49 - 31:53)
quackley leaning into the carnival part (31:54 - 31:59)
there (31:57 - 32:01)
they're leaning into that one real hard (31:59 - 32:04)
uh and then if you're lucky Roselia and (32:01 - 32:07)
then white and orange flbe will appearer (32:04 - 32:10)
more often and then field research uh (32:07 - 32:13)
will be snub Roselia clam love dis furu (32:10 - 32:15)
Stuffle and then Spinda with a heart (32:13 - 32:19)
pattern is coming back there will be a (32:15 - 32:22)
carnival collection challenge which at (32:19 - 32:24)
this point just says Rose raid that's (32:22 - 32:26)
not really a collection challenge it's (32:24 - 32:28)
just evolving a roselli (32:26 - 32:32)
hey that's tough it it says it it (32:28 - 32:34)
results in an encounter with a rose rid (32:32 - 32:37)
oh okay okay okay I thought normally (32:34 - 32:38)
they lay out the collection Challenge on (32:37 - 32:40)
niantic's website and they're like this (32:38 - 32:41)
is what you have to (32:40 - 32:45)
collect maybe maybe I'm misremembering (32:41 - 32:48)
that maybe I'm just hallucinating and (32:45 - 32:50)
that was never a (32:48 - 32:53)
thing uh there's a new Avatar item which (32:50 - 32:55)
is a love (32:53 - 32:59)
dis what TR what's that TR I can't say (32:55 - 33:03)
that word tambourine (32:59 - 33:06)
tambourine good (33:03 - 33:09)
heavens and it's yeah it's a pose you're (33:06 - 33:11)
just dancing around with the (33:09 - 33:13)
tambourine okay it's shaped like a heart (33:11 - 33:15)
if you're in (33:13 - 33:20)
Brazil uh trainers in Brazil will have a (33:15 - 33:22)
exclusive way to earn twice the amount (33:20 - 33:26)
of XP but they didn't say (33:22 - 33:29)
how the amount of XP for catching (33:26 - 33:31)
Pokemon during the (33:29 - 33:34)
event um I'm I'm assuming that's going (33:31 - 33:36)
to start the same time and end the same (33:34 - 33:40)
time that's just okay uh yes it goes (33:36 - 33:42)
along with the Brazilian Carnival that (33:40 - 33:45)
is the carnival part of this event got (33:42 - 33:47)
it and then for (33:45 - 33:50)
$1 you will get timed research featuring (33:47 - 33:53)
Stardust XP two incense five encounter o (33:50 - 33:54)
five encounters with the heart spin (33:53 - 33:57)
that's actually kind of cool um that's (33:54 - 33:58)
it that's that's what it's saying for (33:57 - 34:00)
for that it's time research that means (33:58 - 34:01)
if you don't do it you spent a dollar (34:00 - 34:02)
for no (34:01 - 34:06)
spindas honestly this may be one of the (34:02 - 34:08)
ones that I think may be worth it the (34:06 - 34:10)
spindo with a heart pattern is extra (34:08 - 34:12)
cool because when it's shiny it's a (34:10 - 34:15)
broken heart pattern and not enough (34:12 - 34:18)
people know that yeah yeah yeah it is (34:15 - 34:20)
dang that is really (34:18 - 34:23)
cool okay last soap box of the whole (34:20 - 34:26)
episode I (34:23 - 34:30)
spent statement I I bought with my own (34:26 - 34:33)
money I bought the Team Rocket $5 thing (34:30 - 34:34)
for the (34:33 - 34:37)
pose this is my fault my (34:34 - 34:40)
bad I didn't know I had to battle 40 (34:37 - 34:43)
Team Rocket trainers to get that pose (34:40 - 34:45)
and let me tell you that was the most (34:43 - 34:49)
miserable experience of my life because (34:45 - 34:53)
I waited till the last day and I was (34:49 - 34:56)
like on step what of four and I was like (34:53 - 34:57)
oh you'll probably get get the pose at (34:56 - 34:59)
the end of step three and then the (34:57 - 35:01)
fourth step will probably just be like (34:59 - 35:04)
redeem your like candy rewards whatever (35:01 - 35:07)
and so I did three trainers at home (35:04 - 35:08)
because the balloons are more frequent (35:07 - 35:09)
and then I was like I'll just go to mall (35:08 - 35:11)
America and I'll just do like I'll find (35:09 - 35:14)
trainers there and I did I did two more (35:11 - 35:16)
and then the next step was five battle (35:14 - 35:17)
five more trainers I was like okay cool (35:16 - 35:19)
did that then the next step was Battle (35:17 - 35:22)
10 Trainers and I really debated I was (35:19 - 35:24)
like do I just go home I don't want to (35:22 - 35:26)
do another 10 Trainers and I was like I (35:24 - 35:28)
but but it's time to research it's not (35:26 - 35:32)
like do 30 trainers the next year and (35:28 - 35:34)
you'll eventually get your pose which (35:32 - 35:36)
would have been fine but it was like if (35:34 - 35:38)
I don't get this done in eight hours (35:36 - 35:41)
I've spent $5 on (35:38 - 35:44)
nothing it's the worst and so I did (35:41 - 35:45)
another 10 Trainers and I was like cool (35:44 - 35:48)
the next step four is going to be here's (35:45 - 35:49)
your here's your item here's your (35:48 - 35:51)
Pokemon spawn here's your experience (35:49 - 35:54)
nope it was Battle another 10 (35:51 - 35:58)
Trainers so lesson learned lesson learn (35:54 - 35:59)
I should have checked leak duck before I (35:58 - 36:03)
spent $5 yes (35:59 - 36:06)
correct what quest is that in what (36:03 - 36:10)
Universe was diic was like this is fun (36:06 - 36:12)
let me the universe it thinks battling (36:10 - 36:14)
Team Rocket seven years later is still (36:12 - 36:16)
fun and not (36:14 - 36:19)
I it actively makes me not want to go to (36:16 - 36:22)
a stop if I see a rocket I'm like I'm (36:19 - 36:25)
going the other way I don't want to even (36:22 - 36:27)
accidentally touch it and have to sit (36:25 - 36:30)
through the dialogue if if Niantic was (36:27 - 36:32)
like give us $5 and you can turn off (36:30 - 36:36)
Team Rocket for a week I would I know (36:32 - 36:38)
you're not the only one like just make (36:36 - 36:41)
them disappear for a period of time this (36:38 - 36:43)
is okay so in the carnival thing it was (36:41 - 36:45)
like spend it's probably gonna be $5 (36:43 - 36:47)
dollar get the tambourine pose yes (36:45 - 36:50)
please like I would I would give you (36:47 - 36:51)
more money not to battle Team Rocket I (36:50 - 36:53)
didn't know what I was getting into I (36:51 - 36:55)
thought the quest line was going to be (36:53 - 36:58)
can you buy the Team Rocket pose now it (36:55 - 37:01)
I I haven't checked since the event yeah (36:58 - 37:02)
I'm unsure if you could just buy the (37:01 - 37:05)
pose but it would be the same $5 just (37:02 - 37:08)
without doing any of those Team Rocket (37:05 - 37:11)
battles it was it was it was the (37:08 - 37:11)
worst there was I know sometimes in like (37:11 - 37:18)
Final Fantasy or um like Pokemon unite (37:14 - 37:21)
you can just like spend money to (37:18 - 37:24)
accelerate like the thing like I don't (37:21 - 37:26)
want to do this anymore here's here's (37:24 - 37:28)
like $5 just finish it for me if that (37:26 - 37:31)
was an option for this team rocket event (37:28 - 37:34)
I would have done it it took and I also (37:31 - 37:37)
I don't know how people would like if (37:34 - 37:38)
you waited last minute and you didn't (37:37 - 37:41)
know like me which again well when I say (37:38 - 37:43)
that I think of like a casual player I (37:41 - 37:45)
think of somebody who's like a little (37:43 - 37:48)
bit busy um maybe doesn't live in a big (37:45 - 37:51)
city definitely doesn't have mall (37:48 - 37:54)
America if you spent $5 and then the the (37:51 - 37:57)
task is Battle 30 Team Rocket and you (37:54 - 37:59)
were only doing like maybe three or four (37:57 - 38:01)
a day and then you got to the last day I (37:59 - 38:02)
don't like I don't know what you're (38:01 - 38:05)
doing to like yes spawns have (38:02 - 38:10)
more Rockets but like and it looks like (38:05 - 38:12)
the pose is not purchasable at this (38:10 - 38:13)
point so yeah (38:12 - 38:17)
it's just from that still a lot of work (38:13 - 38:19)
for something that will eventually (38:17 - 38:21)
disappear if you don't finish it again I (38:19 - 38:23)
think the instant way to fix that entire (38:21 - 38:26)
Quest is there's no expiration date you (38:23 - 38:27)
spent the (38:26 - 38:30)
do your 30 Rockets however you want at (38:27 - 38:32)
the end the pose is waiting for you the (38:30 - 38:35)
this this limited pose thing that n (38:32 - 38:37)
keeps doing is or limited pose this (38:35 - 38:40)
limited time event thing is the paid (38:37 - 38:43)
time research is aw the worst it's (38:40 - 38:45)
terrible and they could have they could (38:43 - 38:48)
fix this just by doing a monthly pass (38:45 - 38:50)
and for like $10 a month you get the egg (38:48 - 38:52)
incubator you get the thing if you do it (38:50 - 38:54)
cool if not no big deal because this is (38:52 - 38:56)
what other like Final Fantasy does this (38:54 - 38:57)
as well (38:56 - 39:00)
like hey there's an event this weekend (38:57 - 39:01)
it's part of your $15 membership if you (39:00 - 39:04)
miss it no big deal but you didn't pay (39:01 - 39:06)
extra for it (39:04 - 39:10)
yep yep just just do it but for the (39:06 - 39:11)
record I've given Niantic this feedback (39:10 - 39:14)
multiple times and I've seen other other (39:11 - 39:17)
people also give nank this feedback this (39:14 - 39:19)
limited time Quest thing is is not good (39:17 - 39:22)
is garbage okay speaking of Mo well I (39:19 - 39:24)
guess technically unit's not a mobile (39:22 - 39:26)
game uh but speaking of games that also (39:24 - 39:28)
you can give money well I guess it is (39:26 - 39:29)
mobile game but also on switch it's on (39:28 - 39:31)
my phone it's on your phone but you can (39:29 - 39:33)
give it money speaking of games you can (39:31 - 39:33)
give (39:33 - 39:35)
money we're going to talk about unite (39:33 - 39:37)
when we come back and then we'll talk (39:35 - 39:39)
about the smeargle bug and then we'll (39:37 - 39:42)
talk about me giving Pokemon more money (39:39 - 39:44)
because of this Wan company thing all (39:42 - 39:46)
right uh we will (39:44 - 39:50)
be we will be right back and we are back (39:46 - 39:54)
from our break uh we have some unite (39:50 - 39:57)
news uh quite a bit I think (39:54 - 39:59)
uh this is (39:57 - 40:02)
off the French Sports Illustrated I (39:59 - 40:04)
think Italian Sports Illustrated I don't (40:02 - 40:06)
know I didn't read because they're (40:04 - 40:08)
they're uh their SES littered with ads (40:06 - 40:10)
here (40:08 - 40:14)
um so there is What's called the unite (40:10 - 40:16)
test server so I don't really know if (40:14 - 40:18)
this is spoilers but I've if if you (40:16 - 40:20)
follow any unite news then you know that (40:18 - 40:21)
the unite server exists and then you (40:20 - 40:23)
know Pokemon go up on there and (40:21 - 40:25)
technically the unit server is official (40:23 - 40:27)
so uh covering what other people have (40:25 - 40:29)
covered but there are new I will put an (40:27 - 40:31)
asterisk by some of these CU we need to (40:29 - 40:34)
talk about them these initial reports (40:31 - 40:38)
are are not 100% true okay uh so we're (40:34 - 40:40)
supposed to have three new Pokemon (40:38 - 40:47)
maridon failinks and suru Edge um first (40:40 - 40:52)
though only maridon and uh failinks are (40:47 - 40:55)
in on the test server suru ledge has (40:52 - 40:59)
been found as a placeholder but it has (40:55 - 41:02)
no moves everything about it is a (40:59 - 41:06)
placeholder so people are assuming and (41:02 - 41:09)
that it's fairly a safe assumption that (41:06 - 41:13)
it will be coming at some point but it (41:09 - 41:15)
is not on the test server you cannot (41:13 - 41:17)
play sured right now it doesn't have (41:15 - 41:20)
anything associated with it it doesn't (41:17 - 41:22)
even have its proper moves all the moves (41:20 - 41:24)
that are listed are placeholders from (41:22 - 41:27)
other Pokemon so the two that you can (41:24 - 41:30)
see that we are sure of because they're (41:27 - 41:32)
being tested on the test server are (41:30 - 41:34)
maridon and (41:32 - 41:36)
failings uh maridon is going to be ex (41:34 - 41:40)
license Y which is not surprising (41:36 - 41:44)
um it's supposed to be an attacker uh (41:40 - 41:46)
people are well we've we've heard rumors (41:44 - 41:48)
of Maron a couple months ago so that's (41:46 - 41:51)
not super surprising uh and people were (41:48 - 41:53)
saying that it was probably going to (41:51 - 41:55)
come out around Pokemon day ironically (41:53 - 41:58)
that's in like 20 4 days from now so (41:55 - 42:00)
that kind of makes sense um and then (41:58 - 42:02)
people were also speculating that Maron (42:00 - 42:04)
was going to be free on Pokemon Day free (42:02 - 42:06)
I'm assuming is like do this quest line (42:04 - 42:08)
and at the quest line you get it much (42:06 - 42:10)
like a lot of the ex licenses it is (42:08 - 42:12)
fairly safe to say that this would be (42:10 - 42:16)
another board game collect puzzle pieces (42:12 - 42:21)
type deal to get it for free um again (42:16 - 42:25)
you can pay to complete the (42:21 - 42:27)
puzzle and not have to do it all and get (42:25 - 42:30)
it like they are they are always (42:27 - 42:32)
offering these things for you to pay (42:30 - 42:35)
gems for but probably there will be a (42:32 - 42:38)
free way to get this if Niantic was like (42:35 - 42:40)
here's a dollar you can skip Team Rocket (42:38 - 42:43)
thank you I me here's the money let me (42:40 - 42:46)
move on uh that's saying what maridon (42:43 - 42:48)
can do here Greg can correct me it can (42:46 - 42:49)
create an electric terrain and weaken (42:48 - 42:53)
goal zones fire attacks from a range and (42:49 - 42:55)
use Auto seeking AOE attacks it can (42:53 - 42:57)
drift into into enemies with Electro (42:55 - 43:01)
drift and it can use AOS energy to boost (42:57 - 43:05)
the effects of electric terrain yes uh (43:01 - 43:07)
we don't really know what weaken goal (43:05 - 43:11)
zones means yet I saw a video of it and (43:07 - 43:13)
the the person like commenting was like (43:11 - 43:15)
I don't know what that's doing we can't (43:13 - 43:21)
tell we think it makes you harder to (43:15 - 43:24)
interrupt does we don't you can't tell (43:21 - 43:26)
it's incredibly difficult to tell from (43:24 - 43:29)
the Des server what it's doing uh it (43:26 - 43:32)
creates an electric terrain and (43:29 - 43:34)
something happens while you're in it (43:32 - 43:37)
what that is we don't know um when it (43:34 - 43:39)
says fire attacks from range it's got (43:37 - 43:42)
Thunderbolt and thunder uh Auto seeking (43:39 - 43:47)
AOE attacks so its Thunder move is (43:42 - 43:53)
like Del Fox's spinning fire fire (43:47 - 43:55)
follows so it follows but it's shooting (43:53 - 44:00)
lightning down and then it so it will (43:55 - 44:04)
unlike unlike Del Fox's thing (44:00 - 44:08)
which it it does follow a bit better (44:04 - 44:10)
this one seems to really like focus and (44:08 - 44:12)
hone in on one at least Le Ser it's much (44:10 - 44:15)
better at finding a Target and going (44:12 - 44:18)
straight at it um well that'll probably (44:15 - 44:22)
get changed uh Electro drift is its big (44:18 - 44:26)
thing it can zip across much like um (44:22 - 44:28)
much a lot of electric ones have a jump (44:26 - 44:30)
and jump back thing it just shoots (44:28 - 44:31)
across in a (44:30 - 44:35)
ball um and again we don't know nobody (44:31 - 44:38)
can tell what Electro Trin does so it's (44:35 - 44:40)
like I guess you can boost it we don't (44:38 - 44:43)
know why you would but it would be (44:40 - 44:45)
similar to zachian of like you can use (44:43 - 44:48)
your own AOS energy to do something yeah (44:45 - 44:50)
so zachian creates a Zone and you can (44:48 - 44:52)
pump with AOS energy and then when the (44:50 - 44:54)
Zone goes off the more AOS energy you (44:52 - 44:55)
put into it the more it will damage (44:54 - 44:58)
things (44:55 - 44:59)
this says weekend goals so we don't know (44:58 - 45:02)
if you're pumping it in to make to make (44:59 - 45:04)
it to make it so that you can score (45:02 - 45:07)
almost instantly like we just don't know (45:04 - 45:09)
what this electric train and weekend (45:07 - 45:13)
goals does it it every you I've watched (45:09 - 45:16)
a lot of videos and everybody's (45:13 - 45:18)
like I I can't tell that anything's (45:16 - 45:21)
different I don't know what is doing the (45:18 - 45:22)
ground is different the ground looks (45:21 - 45:25)
different um this is also public test (45:22 - 45:26)
server so (45:25 - 45:28)
[Music] (45:26 - 45:31)
things may not be working as intended so (45:28 - 45:33)
the videos we have it just might not be (45:31 - 45:35)
working yet like they may put it and (45:33 - 45:37)
realize oh it doesn't do what we wanted (45:35 - 45:40)
it to do and it'll get fixed so who who (45:37 - 45:43)
knows what it's going to (45:40 - 45:43)
do uh the next Pokemon what is failinks (45:43 - 45:51)
yep uh (45:48 - 45:53)
which I I don't know how I could (45:51 - 45:56)
describe on this audio show (45:53 - 45:59)
how cool failinks is in motion maybe (45:56 - 46:01)
Greg (45:59 - 46:07)
so cool so unlike you you just sort of (46:01 - 46:10)
expect it to always stay in a line (46:07 - 46:13)
because that's how it is in game but in (46:10 - 46:16)
unite it is able to break up into its (46:13 - 46:19)
individual pieces and take formations (46:16 - 46:22)
one of its moves allows you to just send (46:19 - 46:24)
members out like bombs and they just (46:22 - 46:26)
stay there attacking things that come (46:24 - 46:31)
close and then you can suck them back to (46:26 - 46:34)
yourself it it does turn into a Beyblade (46:31 - 46:37)
for its unite so it does it does let (46:34 - 46:40)
itself rip let it rip it lets itself rip (46:37 - 46:41)
it turns into a big circle thing with (46:40 - 46:44)
them running (46:41 - 46:49)
around it's funny how unique they have (46:44 - 46:52)
made failinks design that nobody is even (46:49 - 46:54)
really caring about maridon they're like (46:52 - 46:58)
whatever it's just another ex yeah (46:54 - 46:58)
lame they messed up they messed up fix (46:58 - 47:07)
for Pokemon day yeah I mean it also (47:02 - 47:09)
looks very broken on the public test so (47:07 - 47:11)
again what you're seeing is public test (47:09 - 47:13)
the numbers are not going to stay that (47:11 - 47:18)
way uh but the basics of what it (47:13 - 47:20)
does are solid like those are going to (47:18 - 47:22)
be its moves it can change its formation (47:20 - 47:24)
when it changes its (47:22 - 47:26)
formation the moves get (47:24 - 47:28)
shorter but do more (47:26 - 47:32)
damage there's a lot of interplay with (47:28 - 47:34)
how the moves that you pick and how (47:32 - 47:36)
failings plays so it is going to (47:34 - 47:39)
probably be a higher skill Pokemon to (47:36 - 47:43)
use um just because I'm GNA be real you (47:39 - 47:46)
can just Mash buttons and unite and get (47:43 - 47:48)
get pretty far but if you want to play (47:46 - 47:50)
these really really well you're going to (47:48 - 47:52)
need to learn how and when to change (47:50 - 47:54)
these things (47:52 - 47:58)
around um okay so I'm going to read the (47:54 - 47:59)
press release and then I'm going to (47:58 - 48:01)
correct the press release uh Shiny (47:59 - 48:02)
Pokemon have made their way into Pokemon (48:01 - 48:04)
unite uh via an in-game item that you (48:02 - 48:07)
have to pay paid Cosmetics are no (48:04 - 48:09)
surprise in a live service game uh but (48:07 - 48:11)
fans are upset that the data miners say (48:09 - 48:13)
that the shiny spray has additional (48:11 - 48:15)
stats 50 HP five attack eight special (48:13 - 48:18)
attack these stats are remarkably low (48:15 - 48:19)
blah blah blah blah blah blah I have (48:18 - 48:21)
official word from the Pokemon company (48:19 - 48:24)
here we have confirmed the glitter spray (48:21 - 48:26)
item is not intended to have stats (48:24 - 48:27)
attached to it the text string is (48:26 - 48:31)
incorrect this effect is cosmetic only (48:27 - 48:34)
so there you go it's called glitter (48:31 - 48:37)
spray so what it seems to do is just add (48:34 - 48:40)
a glitter effect and not change your (48:37 - 48:42)
Pokemon's (48:40 - 48:45)
color so it so people are saying it's it (48:42 - 48:48)
is a shiny treatment it that does not (48:45 - 48:51)
seem to be the case it seems to add a (48:48 - 48:54)
glitter Sparkle around you the unite (48:51 - 48:57)
click baiters are are are hard yeah (48:54 - 49:03)
without actually making you shiny (48:57 - 49:03)
colored yeah the amount of shinies are (49:06 - 49:11)
coming to Pokemon (49:09 - 49:13)
unite clickbait I saw on YouTube in the (49:11 - 49:18)
last like three days there is for sure (49:13 - 49:22)
one shiny coming to Pokemon unite yes uh (49:18 - 49:25)
to celebrate Pokemon day it looks like (49:22 - 49:28)
the anime Shiny Rayquaza will be (49:25 - 49:32)
appearing in the center (49:28 - 49:36)
yes uh wordst out if the bonus boost is (49:32 - 49:39)
going to change in its shiny form so (49:36 - 49:41)
what it gives you for shield is going to (49:39 - 49:44)
be different some people say oh it it (49:41 - 49:46)
gives you different (49:44 - 49:49)
bonuses we we don't we don't I've not (49:46 - 49:51)
seen that actually confirmed so we just (49:49 - 49:54)
know that the shiny model is in game (49:51 - 49:57)
because of horizon (49:54 - 50:00)
uh and that is the only official shiny (49:57 - 50:03)
anything that we have (50:00 - 50:06)
forite I'm I'm still betting I'm still (50:03 - 50:08)
betting that Shiny Rayquaza is coming to (50:06 - 50:10)
scarlet and violet in a sevenstar (50:08 - 50:15)
raid oh yeah probably like this only (50:10 - 50:17)
solidifies it (50:15 - 50:20)
more yeah or they're doing it here and (50:17 - 50:21)
not there because they're not doing the (50:20 - 50:24)
shiny raids there for some reason yeah (50:21 - 50:26)
well I think the shiny rid quaz appears (50:24 - 50:29)
in the second episode of the anime right (50:26 - 50:31)
yeah well is a recurring (50:29 - 50:35)
character oh oh okay so I don't know (50:31 - 50:38)
what that means I I can't watch it here (50:35 - 50:39)
even though it's in English I still (50:38 - 50:41)
can't watch it soon they had to delay it (50:39 - 50:43)
they had to you know the English was (50:41 - 50:45)
complicated to figure out I mean they (50:43 - 50:47)
had to get rid of the horrible English (50:45 - 50:50)
accents to give them American accents um (50:47 - 50:51)
apparently there's also a new Dragon (50:50 - 50:54)
only game mode (50:51 - 50:54)
coming (50:54 - 51:02)
for the six dragons in the game yeah (50:57 - 51:04)
yeah I'm assuming it's very similar to (51:02 - 51:07)
the Eevee it's probably similar to the (51:04 - 51:09)
Eevee to the Pikachu thing it's probably (51:07 - 51:13)
for New Year yeah it's for yeah New Year (51:09 - 51:16)
yeah for Lun New Year uh and probably (51:13 - 51:17)
the (51:16 - 51:20)
middle boss will be Reggie (51:17 - 51:23)
Drago oh yes because D Reggie Drago was (51:20 - 51:25)
was found uh phix is also supposed to be (51:23 - 51:29)
an all a rounder for the Yes again (51:25 - 51:33)
these they're getting real loose with (51:29 - 51:35)
what those terms (51:33 - 51:37)
mean they just L like lots of things all (51:35 - 51:39)
around her and you're (51:37 - 51:42)
like but it it plays like a (51:39 - 51:44)
Speedster but it's all it's that maridon (51:42 - 51:45)
wasn't a (51:44 - 51:49)
Speedster I mean maron's an attacker so (51:45 - 51:52)
I know but Maron zoom zoom fast yeah (51:49 - 51:53)
it's and it will it will probably (51:52 - 51:55)
actually play like a Speedster even (51:53 - 51:57)
though it's called an (51:55 - 52:01)
attacker I don't I don't know um all (51:57 - 52:02)
right well speaking of scarlet and (52:01 - 52:05)
violet uh there was the sevenstar ice (52:02 - 52:08)
impon that happened my assumption is (52:05 - 52:11)
they're going in order of the Elite Four (52:08 - 52:14)
because chrispin had a Blazin amoris had (52:11 - 52:16)
Napoleon the next one should be (52:14 - 52:18)
primarina and then after that should be (52:16 - 52:20)
septile which will be our seven star (52:18 - 52:21)
dragon raid because there's no way that (52:20 - 52:23)
septile isn't dragon type you see how (52:21 - 52:25)
many Dragon type moves that Pokemon gets (52:23 - 52:27)
especially if they're going with the (52:25 - 52:29)
Elite Four from (52:27 - 52:33)
blueberry it has to be Dragon yeah so I (52:29 - 52:35)
I'm assuming the I'm assuming Lacy would (52:33 - 52:38)
be or sorry primarina would be next (52:35 - 52:39)
crazy actually the Seven Star raids just (52:38 - 52:41)
Lacy she's just standing there and you (52:39 - 52:43)
have to battle her um although I could (52:41 - 52:45)
see them putting a pause on that to like (52:43 - 52:48)
do seven star shy Rayquaza or to be (52:45 - 52:50)
Blastoise and Venusaur because they love (52:48 - 52:52)
to do Blastoise and Venusaur anytime (52:50 - 52:55)
there's like a celebration of Pokemon (52:52 - 52:56)
and they've already already used (52:55 - 52:59)
Charizard already used Charizard we've (52:56 - 53:00)
already we already used our Charizard (52:59 - 53:02)
card um the (53:00 - 53:06)
3.0.1 update was released in January (53:02 - 53:08)
January 31st they did it they said mid (53:06 - 53:12)
to late January for most (53:08 - 53:16)
countries many maybe not (53:12 - 53:20)
most it's here um what did they it was a (53:16 - 53:22)
big update too it was like three (53:20 - 53:27)
gigs um so uh if a player used an item (53:22 - 53:32)
to level up Inca to 29 or lower very (53:27 - 53:34)
specific the game would stop responding (53:32 - 53:38)
to button input that bug has been fixed (53:34 - 53:41)
some materials to craft TM 223 metal (53:38 - 53:43)
sound were previously dropped by only (53:41 - 53:44)
one (53:43 - 53:47)
Pokemon uh in only one version of the (53:44 - 53:48)
game that's because one has shield on (53:47 - 53:49)
the other (53:48 - 53:52)
has cranos (53:49 - 53:54)
cranos uh that issue has been resolved (53:52 - 53:57)
they just removed shieldon claws all (53:54 - 54:00)
together to make metal sound they didn't (53:57 - 54:01)
fix the drops they just made it easier (54:00 - 54:04)
to make metal sound in both games so (54:01 - 54:07)
sure whatever uh after you install the (54:04 - 54:10)
item printer in the league club room (54:07 - 54:12)
which can only be once apparently there (54:10 - 54:14)
was a way that you could get stuck (54:12 - 54:17)
between the item printer and the (54:14 - 54:21)
wall and that bug has been (54:17 - 54:24)
fixed not sure how that happens that's (54:21 - 54:27)
cool um the effects of dragon cheer (54:24 - 54:29)
that's where if you use Dragon cheer and (54:27 - 54:30)
you switch out you switch back in you (54:29 - 54:31)
would still have dragon cheer that's not (54:30 - 54:34)
supposed to happen that has been (54:31 - 54:38)
fixed and another really specific bug is (54:34 - 54:42)
with calorex so calor could only calar (54:38 - 54:44)
Rex can only learn certain moves when (54:42 - 54:48)
it's riding glasier Spectre Spectre but (54:44 - 54:51)
then when you removed it from the horses (54:48 - 54:53)
it would still know those moves which it (54:51 - 54:55)
shouldn't and then when you put it back (54:53 - 54:56)
on the horse (54:55 - 54:58)
it didn't know those moves anymore so (54:56 - 55:00)
you'd have to ret (54:58 - 55:03)
them and so all that has been f (55:00 - 55:06)
everything there has been fixed (55:03 - 55:09)
whoops I think a a really good example (55:06 - 55:11)
because people have probably used zashi (55:09 - 55:14)
more than they've used calorx is if you (55:11 - 55:17)
want to get Behemoth blade you just have (55:14 - 55:20)
to have any Steel type move so most (55:17 - 55:22)
people just do iron head and then when (55:20 - 55:24)
you give it the (55:22 - 55:26)
sword (55:24 - 55:28)
it changes it to Behemoth blade and then (55:26 - 55:29)
when you remove the sword it goes back (55:28 - 55:32)
to Iron Head so that would be kind of (55:29 - 55:34)
cool if you remove the sword and then it (55:32 - 55:37)
still has blade because then you could (55:34 - 55:38)
give it a different item and that would (55:37 - 55:42)
be tight um but yeah they CER has been (55:38 - 55:44)
that the thing they didn't (55:42 - 55:46)
mention but they always say at the end (55:44 - 55:48)
of like every company in the world (55:46 - 55:52)
Niantic Bungie Square enex they always (55:48 - 55:54)
say like we've we've fixed other bugs (55:52 - 55:56)
but they never like go into detail but (55:54 - 55:58)
that's the end of every like bug fix is (55:56 - 56:00)
like other bugs have been fixed they (55:58 - 56:03)
didn't say but they fixed the (56:00 - 56:05)
smeargle so we didn't really talk about (56:03 - 56:06)
it that much because we didn't want to (56:05 - 56:08)
like direct people on how to do it I'm (56:06 - 56:09)
sure look if you want to like duplicate (56:08 - 56:11)
your items in your Pokemon you probably (56:09 - 56:13)
looked it up on YouTube but yep (56:11 - 56:15)
ultimately there was a smeargle that if (56:13 - 56:17)
you used I think it was like you (56:15 - 56:19)
transformed into it you ran away from it (56:17 - 56:21)
then it kept everything and you could (56:19 - 56:24)
catch it whatever I'm really simplifying (56:21 - 56:28)
it uh but they how they fixed this was (56:24 - 56:29)
that (56:28 - 56:32)
smeargle can still sketch (56:29 - 56:35)
transform and then when you switch out (56:32 - 56:36)
the Pokemon you want to switch it to (56:35 - 56:38)
like walking wake or whatever when it (56:36 - 56:40)
tries to transform on you it will say (56:38 - 56:42)
transform has failed so it can still (56:40 - 56:44)
learn it you can still use it as your (56:42 - 56:49)
smeargle but the wild smeargle cannot (56:44 - 56:53)
transform during the wild (56:49 - 56:56)
battle that's one way to fix that I (56:53 - 56:58)
guess (56:56 - 57:00)
yeah I thought they were just going to (56:58 - 57:03)
remove the ability to transform yeah (57:00 - 57:05)
that's I mean that's probably the (57:03 - 57:08)
easiest way to have fixed (57:05 - 57:11)
this so that (57:08 - 57:13)
works all of these updates seem so (57:11 - 57:15)
simple and so minor and it's cool that (57:13 - 57:17)
they like fixed it I'm sure the reason (57:15 - 57:19)
this was delayed was literally because (57:17 - 57:21)
of smeargle I'm sure we would have got (57:19 - 57:22)
this update way sooner if the smeargle (57:21 - 57:25)
thing didn't pop up randomly like 10 (57:22 - 57:26)
days (57:25 - 57:28)
ago would have gotten it actually in (57:26 - 57:29)
January (57:28 - 57:32)
everywhere but (57:29 - 57:34)
um I don't know why it was three gigs (57:32 - 57:36)
that just seems like a lot there's no (57:34 - 57:38)
like hidden callow in (57:36 - 57:42)
the not that you know (57:38 - 57:42)
of so yeah they fixed it (57:43 - 57:50)
um I know people are still like are they (57:48 - 57:52)
going to fix the frame rate I (57:50 - 57:55)
don't I don't think they can and I'm not (57:52 - 57:57)
saying that because I know how to code (57:55 - 57:58)
I'm saying that because like other (57:57 - 58:00)
people (57:58 - 58:04)
who work on games say they can't fix (58:00 - 58:07)
it um when they did fix the frame rate (58:04 - 58:11)
the first time it was them just removing (58:07 - 58:12)
like NPCs from the (58:11 - 58:16)
cities like that's how they fixed uh (58:12 - 58:18)
like four of the towns was like oh there (58:16 - 58:21)
was like four more there four extra NPCs (58:18 - 58:22)
just walking around doing nothing it's (58:21 - 58:26)
just cosmetic to like add to the (58:22 - 58:28)
immersion they would have to change some (58:26 - 58:30)
foundational things about the game I'm (58:28 - 58:33)
pretty sure yeah (58:30 - 58:36)
yeah and this is this is why like I I (58:33 - 58:39)
don't want an extra DLC because I it (58:36 - 58:40)
wouldn't it wouldn't come with a (58:39 - 58:43)
foundation change nope which is like (58:40 - 58:45)
fine whatever that ship has sailed like (58:43 - 58:46)
you're either playing Scarlet viol or (58:45 - 58:47)
you're not you're either okay with the (58:46 - 58:49)
frame rate or you hate it but you're (58:47 - 58:53)
still tolerating it it it sucks y it's (58:49 - 58:57)
not it's not great but but maybe maybe (58:53 - 58:59)
this is the downside to DLC because if (58:57 - 59:01)
it was if it was Diamond and Pearl to (58:59 - 59:04)
platinum they hey they they fixed a lot (59:01 - 59:07)
they fixed it oh they fixed it so good (59:04 - 59:09)
in (59:07 - 59:09)
Platinum if this was sun and moon to (59:09 - 59:14)
ultra sun and moon they they also fixed (59:12 - 59:16)
a lot although they fixed a lot to be (59:14 - 59:19)
fair the 3DS was what eight years old (59:16 - 59:21)
nine years old at the time ultra Sun (59:19 - 59:22)
Ultra Moon came out they were really (59:21 - 59:23)
pushing that system they pushing they (59:22 - 59:26)
were pushing it to its limits I mean (59:23 - 59:27)
they every time they put out a third (59:26 - 59:28)
version like they fixed stuff with (59:27 - 59:30)
Crystal they fix stuff with Emerald they (59:28 - 59:33)
fixed stuff in everyone and almost I (59:30 - 59:35)
would say in almost every (59:33 - 59:38)
case I would rather play the third (59:35 - 59:40)
version if I was going to play it again (59:38 - 59:42)
because they just almost always made it (59:40 - 59:45)
better oh yeah um which is so bad that (59:42 - 59:47)
they don't sell as well like they would (59:45 - 59:48)
never sell as well but like I would (59:47 - 59:49)
always be like I can't wait for the (59:48 - 59:51)
third version because this it's going to (59:49 - 59:53)
be better and we just don't get that (59:51 - 59:55)
with DLCs anymore like yeah they just (59:53 - 59:57)
don't have to deal with that (59:55 - 60:01)
anymore I guess even though they should (59:57 - 60:03)
they (60:01 - 60:03)
should yeah (60:05 - 60:10)
um (60:08 - 60:13)
I I I no one knows what Pokemon day is (60:10 - 60:15)
supposed to be you can you can just (60:13 - 60:16)
throw a dart at the board and you could (60:15 - 60:20)
just say like any remake any DLC and (60:16 - 60:22)
maybe you'll be right on one of them I (60:20 - 60:23)
am so looking forward to let's go (60:22 - 60:26)
Legends archus (60:23 - 60:28)
yeah I'm waiting for the remake of (60:26 - 60:30)
Legends archus where they increased the (60:28 - 60:33)
frame rate they add a couple more (60:30 - 60:35)
Pokemon Ultra wormholes make their debut (60:33 - 60:38)
again brilliant brilliant diamond (60:35 - 60:40)
platinum (60:38 - 60:43)
oh Ila just comes glittering Platinum (60:40 - 60:45)
glit Brant Diamond shining Pearl (60:43 - 60:47)
glittering Platinum I take it back I (60:45 - 60:49)
would love Ila to just come out with (60:47 - 60:52)
Platinum for just call it Platinum hey (60:49 - 60:55)
look we made Platinum hey we add two (60:52 - 60:59)
buttons to the PO I will buy (60:55 - 61:01)
that we fixed it where the Pokemon just (60:59 - 61:03)
don't randomly disappear and then show (61:01 - 61:04)
up in front of you when they're (61:03 - 61:07)
following we fixed the ekins animation (61:04 - 61:11)
we did it okay uh the Juan company this (61:07 - 61:14)
was just a couple days ago uh the Juan (61:11 - 61:17)
company has announced that they're (61:14 - 61:19)
expanding their Pokeball replica collect (61:17 - 61:22)
collectible collection that's a heck of (61:19 - 61:23)
a lot of words and they're releasing a (61:22 - 61:25)
new line of mini (61:23 - 61:28)
pokeballs replicas so they're saying (61:25 - 61:30)
five versions of the mini Pokeball (61:28 - 61:33)
replicas are releasing in 2024 and (61:30 - 61:36)
they're saying a full-size beastball (61:33 - 61:39)
replica is coming in October which I (61:36 - 61:42)
felt like no one reported or talked (61:39 - 61:45)
about the beastball which is like super (61:42 - 61:46)
exciting for me because I think the (61:45 - 61:48)
Beast like beastball is so cool I know (61:46 - 61:50)
one person that's incredibly excited (61:48 - 61:55)
about this so okay so the one that I (61:50 - 61:59)
have the luxury ball what size is that (61:55 - 62:03)
that's full size okay so the mini size (61:59 - 62:06)
is is mini mini it's great mini the mini (62:03 - 62:08)
thing also comes with a bunch of things (62:06 - 62:09)
that people weren't talking about which (62:08 - 62:12)
is cool um (62:09 - 62:15)
so first five mini pokeballs will start (62:12 - 62:17)
launching in February this makes sense (62:15 - 62:19)
because it probably be around Pokemon (62:17 - 62:20)
day uh they're going to start (62:19 - 62:22)
specifically say it's coming out for (62:20 - 62:24)
Pokemon day yeah they're going to say (62:22 - 62:27)
mini great ball mini Ultra Ball uh mini (62:24 - 62:29)
cherish ball mini Premier Ball and then (62:27 - 62:32)
obviously mini Poke (62:29 - 62:34)
Ball they're going to be they're not (62:32 - 62:36)
going to be all releasing at once so I'm (62:34 - 62:37)
assuming we're getting the Pokeball (62:36 - 62:41)
first I don't know if it says here uh (62:37 - 62:43)
furthermore the full sign fullsize (62:41 - 62:45)
Pokeball replicas will continue to (62:43 - 62:47)
expand with beastball coming so I don't (62:45 - 62:48)
think we're getting any more fulls size (62:47 - 62:50)
besides just the beastball this year (62:48 - 62:52)
trainers can look forward to additional (62:50 - 62:54)
full-size Pokey and mini balls also in (62:52 - 62:56)
20 25 so they much has just signed (62:54 - 62:59)
another pretty big deal here um or these (62:56 - 63:01)
must be selling pretty decently where (62:59 - 63:04)
Pokemon is like yep continue to to make (63:01 - 63:06)
them uh with the same display grade (63:04 - 63:09)
Ultra Premium Precision diecast metal (63:06 - 63:11)
construction as the fullsize Pokeball (63:09 - 63:13)
the mini Pokeball replicas will be (63:11 - 63:15)
equipped with touch and proximity (63:13 - 63:18)
sensing technology the mini pokeballs (63:15 - 63:21)
will also come with a new touch (63:18 - 63:26)
controlled stand with the Pokeball (63:21 - 63:28)
Illuminating and a new multicolored (63:26 - 63:31)
glitter ring display in addition this is (63:28 - 63:33)
the cool part each mini Pokeball will (63:31 - 63:35)
also come with its own collectible (63:33 - 63:37)
Silver Plate token plated token (63:35 - 63:40)
featuring different Pokemon Silhouettes (63:37 - 63:42)
which can be used in an alternative way (63:40 - 63:45)
to display the (63:42 - 63:46)
replica (63:45 - 63:48)
um they didn't say like specifically (63:46 - 63:52)
which Pokémon I also I'm unclear if like (63:48 - 63:54)
every Pokeball is coming with different (63:52 - 63:55)
Pokémon (63:54 - 63:59)
plates the little coins yeah so I don't (63:55 - 64:01)
know if this is like a K-pop thing where (63:59 - 64:03)
you got to buy like the Same album like (64:01 - 64:06)
five times because you want specific (64:03 - 64:08)
like K-pop I think is that kind of thing (64:06 - 64:10)
but it looks like it may only be a (64:08 - 64:12)
handful of gen one Pokemon just from the (64:10 - 64:14)
ones they have photos of they have an (64:12 - 64:15)
Eevee they have a (64:14 - 64:18)
squirtle I wouldn't be surprised if it's (64:15 - 64:20)
just the starters and Eevee and Gyarados (64:18 - 64:22)
or something like that Gengar it's (64:20 - 64:26)
always Gyarados and Gengar Gyarados (64:22 - 64:29)
ganger um yeah and then the rest of the (64:26 - 64:31)
press release just talks about (64:29 - 64:34)
the you know what the wand company is if (64:31 - 64:35)
you don't know what the wand company is (64:34 - 64:36)
they started off making like very (64:35 - 64:39)
high-end Harry Potter wands for like 150 (64:36 - 64:40)
bucks and then they moved on to like (64:39 - 64:44)
Star Trek they did um like a lot of like (64:40 - 64:47)
Fallout stuff like the giant thing you (64:44 - 64:49)
put on your arm for Fallout obviously (64:47 - 64:50)
now they're making pokeballs I think (64:49 - 64:52)
they make a couple other things um I (64:50 - 64:54)
think they're out of the I'm pretty sure (64:52 - 64:55)
they're British compan (64:54 - 64:57)
company um I don't think they're (64:55 - 64:58)
particularly big I think they only have (64:57 - 65:01)
like 20 or some employees but they I (64:58 - 65:02)
feel like they probably should have (65:01 - 65:05)
thought about the wand company a bit (65:02 - 65:08)
more as a company name yeah because they (65:05 - 65:10)
don't they don't really make those wands (65:08 - 65:12)
anymore I think they they used to make (65:10 - 65:13)
like nine of them and I think they only (65:12 - 65:18)
make one now yep nice they should make (65:13 - 65:21)
zero yeah you're probably (65:18 - 65:23)
correct you could just have a general (65:21 - 65:26)
standard one W and lots of places use (65:23 - 65:29)
wands it doesn't have to be a specific (65:26 - 65:31)
yeah and they have that you're following (65:29 - 65:33)
they have they have been like and it's (65:31 - 65:35)
just a magic wand you know like Wizards (65:33 - 65:38)
use like in DND D and stuff also (65:35 - 65:42)
composers use it too don't not that (65:38 - 65:45)
other one sh yeah I I I don't think they (65:42 - 65:46)
have Harry Potter on their website (65:45 - 65:49)
anymore they do not I'm there looking (65:46 - 65:51)
around it's (65:49 - 65:55)
gone good for them um (65:51 - 65:56)
they did you guys see a price on the (65:55 - 65:59)
minis I'm going to assume like 50 60 (65:56 - 66:01)
bucks yeah there's no price stated so (65:59 - 66:04)
far but I've seen speculations of around (66:01 - 66:08)
50 bucks yeah half (66:04 - 66:12)
price like for us feels like oh yeah cuz (66:08 - 66:15)
it's smaller but no it's probably going (66:12 - 66:18)
to be like 65 like like they're not (66:15 - 66:20)
going to cut the price in half they're (66:18 - 66:23)
going to cut the price still have a real (66:20 - 66:26)
fancy base to it Co they've got a lot (66:23 - 66:28)
going on in there to justify them not (66:26 - 66:31)
selling it at half price it's it's (66:28 - 66:33)
interesting that they decided to keep (66:31 - 66:36)
the touch sensors and the proximity in (66:33 - 66:38)
it like that's I thought they would like (66:36 - 66:40)
get rid of that I I know like touch (66:38 - 66:44)
sensing and like glowing is not like the (66:40 - 66:45)
most advanced technology in the world I (66:44 - 66:47)
don't know how much space it takes up (66:45 - 66:49)
the battery inside the (66:47 - 66:53)
Pokeball is from front to back it's like (66:49 - 66:55)
the the circle that you press to open it (66:53 - 66:57)
and back yeah they are (66:55 - 67:00)
like because I I post these on like (66:57 - 67:02)
Instagram and Tik Tok and like my (67:00 - 67:03)
unboxings and stuff people are always (67:02 - 67:05)
like oh they look so cheap or a lot of (67:03 - 67:06)
people think they're plastic when (67:05 - 67:08)
they're not they are not PL they're (67:06 - 67:13)
Hefty they are Hefty like they like a (67:08 - 67:16)
billyard a Billard Ball B Billard pool (67:13 - 67:17)
ball I say pool ball but I don't want (67:16 - 67:19)
people to think like like a beach pool (67:17 - 67:24)
like the a billiard's ball yes like it I (67:19 - 67:26)
looked up the weight of the two and the (67:24 - 67:28)
Pokeball is like twice the weight of (67:26 - 67:32)
that mhm it like you if you threw it at (67:28 - 67:36)
a wall it would put a hole in your wall (67:32 - 67:39)
you a monster to capture it it would (67:36 - 67:41)
hurt the (67:39 - 67:41)
monster it's it's legitimately a very (67:41 - 67:48)
heavy metal (67:45 - 67:50)
ball I don't think that look I don't (67:48 - 67:51)
think that justifies the $100 price I'm (67:50 - 67:53)
not defending that they should be $100 I (67:51 - 67:57)
just understand that like high when (67:53 - 67:59)
highend well even not even a highend you (67:57 - 68:00)
just use the word replica and you can (67:59 - 68:02)
get away with charging whatever you want (68:00 - 68:04)
yeah but they are nice they are J nice (68:02 - 68:07)
are they a $100 nice no but like you you (68:04 - 68:08)
don't need this you also don't need (68:07 - 68:10)
Funko Pops you don't need a lot of (68:08 - 68:14)
things like it's just I like it (68:10 - 68:16)
because I have a million plastic (68:14 - 68:18)
pokeballs I do I think Pokéballs are (68:16 - 68:20)
cool but like I got I got pokeballs I (68:18 - 68:22)
got the cheap aluminum pokeballs you get (68:20 - 68:25)
a Costco with the the Pokemon cards (68:22 - 68:28)
that's the collection I have the $10 (68:25 - 68:30)
ones not the $100 ones I finally opened (68:28 - 68:32)
my great ball back (68:30 - 68:35)
there um no one needs any of this (68:32 - 68:37)
Trainer Box I need to do something (68:35 - 68:40)
with uh but it's fine uh I think these (68:37 - 68:41)
mini Pokéballs are cool I'm assuming (68:40 - 68:43)
this is just you know going for a (68:41 - 68:47)
cheaper Market if they are (68:43 - 68:49)
actually somewhat less (68:47 - 68:52)
expensive I really like the size of them (68:49 - 68:54)
I'm very tempted by the mini ones (68:52 - 68:56)
yeah I'm definitely going to keep my (68:54 - 68:57)
eyee on (68:56 - 69:01)
that the question is like do I ignore (68:57 - 69:04)
them and just commit the full size yes (69:01 - 69:07)
because I can't I just can't keep if I (69:04 - 69:09)
if I buy five of these and then they (69:07 - 69:12)
come out with finish the set I mean I (69:09 - 69:15)
will I will probably purchase the mini (69:12 - 69:17)
luxury ball because I'm only buying (69:15 - 69:21)
luxury balls cuz I lived the luxury (69:17 - 69:21)
life yeah the most disappointing thing (69:21 - 69:25)
here is we're only getting Beast ball (69:24 - 69:28)
although that's a very cool one to get (69:25 - 69:30)
no no no dream ball no (69:28 - 69:33)
moon no (69:30 - 69:33)
moonball for audio listeners you just (69:33 - 69:39)
turned around and looked at their shelf (69:36 - 69:42)
no moon all of them there I do have all (69:39 - 69:46)
of them yeah we're up to (69:42 - 69:46)
14 we're we're getting into the real (69:46 - 69:52)
obscure ones at this point they need the (69:48 - 69:56)
strange ball oh my gosh that would be so (69:52 - 69:58)
cool I love the strange (69:56 - 70:01)
ball not that not that knockoff Tiffany (69:58 - 70:03)
in company (70:01 - 70:06)
won I want the onean company not the (70:03 - 70:07)
Tiffany and (70:06 - 70:09)
Company they really messed up on their (70:07 - 70:12)
name they really dropped the ball the (70:09 - 70:15)
one company for sure for sure they're (70:12 - 70:17)
check on it (70:15 - 70:19)
now I mean it would be worse if they (70:17 - 70:21)
called themselves the ball company cuz (70:19 - 70:22)
people would be very confused yeah you (70:21 - 70:24)
can't really you can't really do that (70:22 - 70:27)
the the the replica company that's not (70:24 - 70:31)
good either that's just it's all it's (70:27 - 70:32)
all (70:31 - 70:34)
bad (70:32 - 70:36)
the oh they do Doctor Who as well I (70:34 - 70:39)
didn't know that yeah they do sonic (70:36 - 70:41)
screwdrivers (70:39 - 70:44)
nice H how how many more pokeballs do we (70:41 - 70:48)
have left a lot there's a lot of balls a (70:44 - 70:49)
lot there is a there's a lot of there's (70:48 - 70:52)
a lot of Pokéballs left quite a (70:49 - 70:55)
few a lot lot of apricorn balls that (70:52 - 70:56)
never worked in Gen (70:55 - 70:58)
2 are they going to add the apricorns (70:56 - 71:00)
after that get your own (70:58 - 71:04)
apricorns replica (71:00 - 71:04)
aornic I think I think the cherish ball (71:04 - 71:08)
is probably the coolest one they (71:06 - 71:10)
released because it has that cool like (71:08 - 71:13)
indent with the sides on it yeah the (71:10 - 71:15)
ones that are different shapes that (71:13 - 71:17)
actually have add-ons to them like the (71:15 - 71:19)
cherish ball or the Beast ball or the (71:17 - 71:21)
heavy ball I think those are some of the (71:19 - 71:24)
cooler they heavy yeah but they're doing (71:21 - 71:27)
the Beast ball so they're opening (71:24 - 71:29)
possibilities also they haven't done the (71:27 - 71:31)
other heavy ball which was the worst (71:29 - 71:33)
naming thing in the entire world where (71:31 - 71:35)
the heavy ball in Legends archus is not (71:33 - 71:36)
the same nor does it function the same (71:35 - 71:39)
as the heavy ball in the other (71:36 - 71:43)
games we need a jet ball and a wing ball (71:39 - 71:45)
yeah and then there's the there's the (71:43 - 71:48)
just the apricorn Poke Ball and great (71:45 - 71:51)
ball and Ultra Ball which there is an (71:48 - 71:53)
apricorn Pokeball on the Pokemon Center (71:51 - 71:55)
I think it's seven $70 (71:53 - 71:57)
$69 um but that's not made by the W (71:55 - 71:59)
company it's also it's not the same (71:57 - 72:02)
quality yeah it's it's made of like a a (71:59 - 72:05)
resin poly Stone and which is just like (72:02 - 72:08)
plastic and gravel merg (72:05 - 72:10)
together then I think it's it's it's (72:08 - 72:12)
it's bigger too I don't actually know if (72:10 - 72:15)
the Legends archus pokeballs are (72:12 - 72:16)
supposed to be bigger than regular (72:15 - 72:17)
pokeballs because they're mechanical but (72:16 - 72:19)
it is bigger than the WAN company (72:17 - 72:21)
pokeballs the WAN company pokeballs are (72:19 - 72:24)
supposed to be accurate size and the (72:21 - 72:26)
small ones are supposed to be the size (72:24 - 72:27)
of the pokeballs when they're shrunken (72:26 - 72:29)
down to fit on your belt what I didn't (72:27 - 72:32)
