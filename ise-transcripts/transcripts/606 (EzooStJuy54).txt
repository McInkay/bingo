exciting it's it's the middle of the day (0:52 - 0:59)
so less notable I suppose I have less (0:54 - 0:59)
excuse (0:59 - 1:04)
I feel like this is like the first (1:00 - 1:07)
official episode you've been on Chris (1:04 - 1:09)
otherwise we've done like crossover (1:07 - 1:12)
episodes but like not a numbered episode (1:09 - 1:16)
yes it's true I'm nervous oh my (1:12 - 1:19)

Pokemon go a specific podcast so um you (1:32 - 1:36)
you get your Pokémon go news here we (1:35 - 1:38)
also cover the same news over there so (1:36 - 1:40)
if you you like what you hear more of (1:38 - 1:43)
that at goast that's pretty much it you (1:40 - 1:44)
can find us anywhere (1:43 - 1:47)
hey yep and anywhere you find podcast if (1:44 - 1:49)
you're watching the video version I am (1:47 - 1:50)
still like sunburnt because I got (1:49 - 1:55)
sunburnt at the event I forgot sunscreen (1:50 - 1:57)
but it was like so nice we like here's (1:55 - 2:00)
okay so this episode we're going to talk (1:57 - 2:01)
we're we're just going to talk about uh (2:00 - 2:02)
the go tour cuz we were there whether it (2:01 - 2:05)
was worth the money all that stuff a (2:02 - 2:07)
first time Al was in America it's also (2:05 - 2:09)
like when this comes out it's coming out (2:07 - 2:11)
the day before Pokemon day and we've (2:09 - 2:14)
already done a speculation episode so (2:11 - 2:16)
we'll do like a Pokemon Day episode (2:14 - 2:18)
obviously when that happens so this is (2:16 - 2:20)
like a good we'll hold holding us over (2:18 - 2:22)
until Pokemon (2:20 - 2:28)
day but I guess starting with the event (2:22 - 2:31)
uh it had perfect weather except it was (2:28 - 2:33)
too perfect it was deceiving and I (2:31 - 2:34)
didn't put sunscreen on cuz it was like (2:33 - 2:37)
65 there was a nice breeze there was (2:34 - 2:38)
some (2:37 - 2:41)
clouds and then I got gets you yeah (2:38 - 2:43)
because it's like you go oh it's not (2:41 - 2:47)
Sunny yeah but those UV rays still get (2:43 - 2:49)
you and it's winter we're not meant to (2:47 - 2:51)
get sunburnt in the winter yeah that's (2:49 - 2:53)
true I've never gotten sunburnt in (2:51 - 2:56)
February before really it's niantic's (2:53 - 3:00)
fault how dare they I don't I don't (2:56 - 3:03)
think I don't think I got sunburn in (3:00 - 3:05)
Vegas you didn't I certainly did I got (3:03 - 3:07)
cooked in Vegas oh yeah I think I do (3:05 - 3:08)
remember (3:07 - 3:11)
that yeah I'm pretty sure I was close to (3:08 - 3:13)
sun poisoning again which is like a a (3:11 - 3:16)
live event go uh staple for me (3:13 - 3:18)
personally I suppose I feel like in (3:16 - 3:19)
Vegas don't you get sunburnt just from (3:18 - 3:21)
the the artificial lighting it's so (3:19 - 3:25)
strong it's true then Neon Chris you're (3:21 - 3:27)
right (3:25 - 3:30)
up uh so some disclosures here (3:27 - 3:34)
uh Niantic did pay for Chris's ticket (3:30 - 3:37)
and my ticket to the event um which was (3:34 - 3:41)
like what like $35 or something (3:37 - 3:44)
uh yeah plus all the add-ons so whatever (3:41 - 3:46)
that value was was like 70 some odd some (3:44 - 3:49)
odd dollars I think oh the egg incubator (3:46 - 3:51)
the the yeah yeah yeah so but no shirt (3:49 - 3:53)
for whatever reason niantic's like you (3:51 - 3:55)
got to buy your own shirt no (3:53 - 3:57)
shirt no (3:55 - 3:59)
handouts we're not hanging it out shirts (3:57 - 4:01)
here for free so just disclosure nitic (3:59 - 4:03)
did pay for our tickets Al paid for his (4:01 - 4:06)
own ticket and then we all paid for our (4:03 - 4:09)
own flights and hotels so there's your (4:06 - 4:11)
disclosure whether or not which was (4:09 - 4:13)
significantly more than (4:11 - 4:16)
$35 yeah it's (4:13 - 4:16)
true uh and it was Al's first time in (4:17 - 4:23)
America do we want to start there Al I (4:21 - 4:25)
thought you would have way more culture (4:23 - 4:27)
shock and it didn't seem like you had (4:25 - 4:29)
any so well I wouldn't say there wasn't (4:27 - 4:33)
any I think at the actual event it was (4:29 - 4:34)
very easy not to have culture shock (4:33 - 4:36)
right because it's just a golf course (4:34 - 4:39)
and sure there was the stadium but like (4:36 - 4:41)
we have stadia here like it's not an (4:39 - 4:43)
unusual thing like none of that was (4:41 - 4:45)
weird um and it's not like American (4:43 - 4:47)
people being around is weird like I live (4:45 - 4:49)
near Edinburgh which is a very touristy (4:47 - 4:51)
City so there's always Americans right I (4:49 - 4:56)
will say I think the the most foreign it (4:51 - 4:59)
felt was when after I got off the the (4:56 - 5:02)
Metro and I was walking to my hotel and (4:59 - 5:06)
I was like wait how do roads work I just (5:02 - 5:10)
I suddenly realized these crosswalks as (5:06 - 5:13)
you call them there are so different to (5:10 - 5:15)
how Crossings work over here so it's (5:13 - 5:17)
just like I have no idea how to work (5:15 - 5:19)
these immediately like sure you press (5:17 - 5:21)
the button but you have to find the (5:19 - 5:23)
button the buttons are not in the place (5:21 - 5:25)
I would expect them to be you know that (5:23 - 5:27)
was probably the biggest shock to me is (5:25 - 5:28)
just like (5:27 - 5:31)
roads yeah I noticed when I was with (5:28 - 5:34)
tone that he wouldn't walk when it said (5:31 - 5:35)
do not (5:34 - 5:39)
walk but like you have so much time so I (5:35 - 5:42)
think that I think that's because so (5:39 - 5:45)
here jaywalking is not illegal at all (5:42 - 5:46)
right so I would do all the time (5:45 - 5:49)
here but I am aware that at least in (5:46 - 5:51)
some places in America it is illegal and (5:49 - 5:53)
the chances of you getting caught are (5:51 - 5:56)
very minuscule but I think when you're (5:53 - 5:57)
in I don't know about you guys but when (5:56 - 5:59)
you're in a foreign country I think you (5:57 - 6:02)
are way more careful than you need to be (5:59 - 6:03)
because it's like I am not doing (6:02 - 6:06)
anything that risks me getting arrested (6:03 - 6:09)
even on the most silly thing so yeah (6:06 - 6:11)
like that I think was probably the (6:09 - 6:12)
reason (6:11 - 6:14)
why yeah that's that's completely fair (6:12 - 6:17)
I'm from Chicago so uh Jay Walkin is (6:14 - 6:18)
even in my vocabulary I think it's (6:17 - 6:21)
technically not legal but (6:18 - 6:24)
whatever yeah I feel like if you're in (6:21 - 6:26)
Chicago You're everyone's jaywalking if (6:24 - 6:27)
you're if you're not jaywalking you're (6:26 - 6:30)
you you you're you're a tour right the (6:27 - 6:33)
crosswalk is where the traffic is (6:30 - 6:36)
not that's the rule of (6:33 - 6:38)
them yeah yeah there was actually there (6:36 - 6:41)
was one there was one intersection I (6:38 - 6:43)
noticed in Pasadena that had crosswalks (6:41 - 6:46)
diagonally as well as across the way and (6:43 - 6:48)
even there I there I felt I heard some (6:46 - 6:50)
Americans confused and they were like I (6:48 - 6:52)
don't I feel like I'm doing something (6:50 - 6:54)
wrong walking diagonally across and I'm (6:52 - 6:55)
like that's funny because like yeah I (6:54 - 6:57)
would just do that all the time in in (6:55 - 7:00)
the cities here oh I feel like for an (6:57 - 7:04)
event in Pasadena I okay I feel like (7:00 - 7:07)
silly I was going to say dumb but Al but (7:04 - 7:09)
but mostly silly I like I booked my (7:07 - 7:11)
hotel in Pasadena which was like (7:09 - 7:14)
slightly more expensive cuz Pasadena's (7:11 - 7:17)
like a nicer City and I felt like I (7:14 - 7:20)
spent zero time in (7:17 - 7:22)
Pasadena and it was like we were always (7:20 - 7:24)
driving somewhere else yeah I was like (7:22 - 7:26)
why did I book (7:24 - 7:30)
here at all but there was Niantic did (7:26 - 7:33)
do like here are some touristy things to (7:30 - 7:35)
do in Pasadena and the for the most part (7:33 - 7:38)
they're all pretty walkable and I don't (7:35 - 7:40)
think I did any of them like I walked to (7:38 - 7:43)
a uh a Jack In The Box and I walked to a (7:40 - 7:46)
r Aid and I walked to a Target but those (7:43 - 7:48)
were just to like get Necessities not to (7:46 - 7:52)
necessarily explore the city they did (7:48 - 7:54)
have (7:52 - 7:57)
a parking ride station in Pasadena that (7:54 - 7:59)
you park your car and then the bus would (7:57 - 8:01)
just just there was just constant buses (7:59 - 8:02)
that were free that would take you to (8:01 - 8:05)
the stadium but it wasn't efficient for (8:02 - 8:09)
me to do that it was a 25 minute walk to (8:05 - 8:12)
walk to the station and then another (8:09 - 8:14)
like 15 minutes on the bus cuz it has to (8:12 - 8:16)
go its weird way where I could just take (8:14 - 8:21)
a a 10 minute Uber for $10 which I guess (8:16 - 8:23)
was the benefit of being in Pasadena the (8:21 - 8:24)
Uber was really cheap and then just have (8:23 - 8:28)
them drop me off um and then you could (8:24 - 8:31)
just drive and park there for $30 I (8:28 - 8:33)
think parking was $30 and I don't know (8:31 - 8:35)
how much of a mess that was it's a (8:33 - 8:37)
stadium I'm sure they had way more than (8:35 - 8:39)
enough parking for that so yeah I don't (8:37 - 8:41)
think the amount of parking was the (8:39 - 8:43)
problem I think it was the everybody (8:41 - 8:44)
came out at the same time that was the (8:43 - 8:47)
issue so we so you you got there what (8:44 - 8:50)
half an 40 40 minutes 45 minutes ahead (8:47 - 8:52)
of us or something and we got the bus we (8:50 - 8:55)
we drove to um the uh the parking ride (8:52 - 8:57)
and we got on the bus and the bus was (8:55 - 8:59)
fine for most of the time but once we (8:57 - 9:02)
got on the road down to the the down to (8:59 - 9:04)
the stadium it was gridlock there were (9:02 - 9:05)
so many cars cuz there were like three (9:04 - 9:08)
roads all coming together at one point (9:05 - 9:09)
and there were cues up all of those (9:08 - 9:11)
roads So eventually what we managed to (9:09 - 9:13)
do is we actually convinced the bus (9:11 - 9:14)
driver to let us off and we walked down (9:13 - 9:16)
and we were overtaking the traffic at (9:14 - 9:18)
that point so I think it was just like (9:16 - 9:19)
everybody decided oh I'm going to get (9:18 - 9:21)
there for 10 to n and that gives me (9:19 - 9:23)
enough time but of course if everybody (9:21 - 9:24)
decides they're going to do that and (9:23 - 9:26)
10,000 people decide they want to park (9:24 - 9:29)
the cars all at the same time that's the (9:26 - 9:30)
problem there (9:29 - 9:32)
which doesn't make sense cuz this is a (9:30 - 9:36)
stadium and I feel like getting more (9:32 - 9:37)
spread out then when there's an actual (9:36 - 9:40)
game I don't know yeah I don't know (9:37 - 9:43)
assume there's a football game they know (9:40 - 9:45)
how to handle traffic I guess I don't (9:43 - 9:46)
know like with with football games (9:45 - 9:48)
people are showing up like two hours (9:46 - 9:50)
early or or more sometimes to tailgate (9:48 - 9:52)
and stuff so maybe that does sort of (9:50 - 9:54)
like help a little bit but yeah we were (9:52 - 9:56)
all trying to get there like within the (9:54 - 9:58)
same 30 minutes and there's just like on (9:56 - 10:01)
Lane streets surrounding the stadium (9:58 - 10:03)
more or less and it was just like (10:01 - 10:05)
neighborhoods right away and then the (10:03 - 10:07)
stadium so it was it was pretty crazy I (10:05 - 10:09)
think infrastructure wise but but Ubers (10:07 - 10:11)
were remarkably cheap I do want to go (10:09 - 10:13)
back and highlight that because (10:11 - 10:15)
especially compared to uh getting an (10:13 - 10:18)
Uber in New York for go Fest like the (10:15 - 10:20)
same distance was like three times the (10:18 - 10:21)
cost I was I was very surprised in (10:20 - 10:24)
California to see Uber's that (10:21 - 10:27)
cheap yeah um and then the Ubers for (10:24 - 10:31)
Vegas were also not very cheap either no (10:27 - 10:33)
and it was much farther cuz there was (10:31 - 10:38)
nothing around the Vegas park at all (10:33 - 10:42)
Subway there was the not not a Subway (10:38 - 10:44)
but the food Subway not a subway station (10:42 - 10:47)
a Subway restaurant that's right so I I (10:44 - 10:48)
wonder I wonder I wonder how much of (10:47 - 10:50)
that is to do with it's California in (10:48 - 10:53)
February because Vegas I suspect is (10:50 - 10:56)
probably pretty busy all year round (10:53 - 10:57)
right cuz like you don't go there to be (10:56 - 11:00)
outside you go in you go there to go (10:57 - 11:03)
gamble and drink and and do all those (11:00 - 11:06)
things right whereas in California you (11:03 - 11:08)
go to go to the beach and so it's not (11:06 - 11:10)
going to be as busy in February and then (11:08 - 11:12)
obviously New York was in the summer (11:10 - 11:16)
which all bets off then right yeah (11:12 - 11:19)
yes seemingly so at least I don't live (11:16 - 11:21)
there but it definitely it seemed like (11:19 - 11:24)
that for sure I don't know maybe people (11:21 - 11:25)
are going to New York in January and (11:24 - 11:27)
February I don't know I wouldn't cuz i' (11:25 - 11:29)
be too risky getting stuck in the snow (11:27 - 11:31)
you know get ice skate to the Statue of (11:29 - 11:34)
Liberty in back you know yeah that (11:31 - 11:37)
freezes right over I'm sure absolutely (11:34 - 11:39)
so for being a stadium I have like I (11:37 - 11:41)
have three problems written down for (11:39 - 11:43)
this entire event which is very which is (11:41 - 11:45)
a small amount of problems compared to (11:43 - 11:48)
past Pokemon go events the first problem (11:45 - 11:52)
was for being a stadium and having (11:48 - 11:55)
technically eight plus entrances how (11:52 - 11:57)
like ABCD (11:55 - 12:00)
EFG H I don't know the there was an I I (11:57 - 12:04)
think went up to H um they only had one (12:00 - 12:05)
entrance (12:04 - 12:11)
open and I guess I was foolish (12:05 - 12:14)
or I was surprised but not (12:11 - 12:17)
surprised the thing that happened in (12:14 - 12:20)
Vegas so here's some context the thing (12:17 - 12:21)
that happened in Vegas is Niantic put (12:20 - 12:25)
out a tweet saying hey I love I love (12:21 - 12:26)
this tweet by the way I thought this (12:25 - 12:28)
tweet was awesome they said hey if you (12:26 - 12:30)
don't have a take it to this event maybe (12:28 - 12:33)
don't show up and it was like a very (12:30 - 12:36)
passive aggressive tweet and I'm all for (12:33 - 12:38)
them being passive aggressive I think it (12:36 - 12:40)
was great I loved it I know some people (12:38 - 12:42)
were like well that's your fa like no I (12:40 - 12:45)
thought it was a great tweet I stand by (12:42 - 12:47)
the passive aggressive Niantic I loved (12:45 - 12:52)
it but what happened in Vegas is they (12:47 - 12:54)
put up a Wi-Fi network and they they (12:52 - 12:56)
calculated I don't know the math of like (12:54 - 12:58)
we can have this many people in this (12:56 - 13:00)
area and everything will be fine they (12:58 - 13:03)
calculated it to be like 20,000 people (13:00 - 13:05)
and I think they sold like 18,000 (13:03 - 13:07)
tickets for that event or something it (13:05 - 13:09)
was like they had just like a buffer of (13:07 - 13:12)
people and then what happened is 30,000 (13:09 - 13:14)
people showed up and this is like a (13:12 - 13:16)
classic American thing and I even saw (13:14 - 13:19)
this leading up to this event the this (13:16 - 13:21)
event the the LA event of like I don't (13:19 - 13:23)
have a ticket I'm still going to show up (13:21 - 13:26)
and play or I don't have a ticket but (13:23 - 13:27)
maybe I'll I'll get a ticket when I'm (13:26 - 13:30)
there or I don't have a ticket it but my (13:27 - 13:34)
friend is going and so you have 30,000 (13:30 - 13:36)
people on a 20,000 person Network and (13:34 - 13:37)
then the whole thing (13:36 - 13:39)
crashed (13:37 - 13:42)
and you it is a public park you allowed (13:39 - 13:45)
to be in it right (13:42 - 13:47)
like but I think there's like that (13:45 - 13:50)
entitlement of like or or the like lack (13:47 - 13:53)
of research of like even when I was (13:50 - 13:55)
walking into La I walked past a group of (13:53 - 13:57)
people that were like we don't have (13:55 - 13:59)
tickets we'll just get them at the door (13:57 - 14:01)
and like there there there is no tickets (13:59 - 14:04)
at the door yeah like how how did you (14:01 - 14:07)
pay $30 to park drive all this way and (14:04 - 14:11)
then like walk up with the the mindset (14:07 - 14:13)
of like they must have tickets there (14:11 - 14:16)
yeah and and the I think the thing is I (14:13 - 14:18)
can understand now having been in a city (14:16 - 14:20)
where a Pokémon go event is happening I (14:18 - 14:23)
can understand people going I want to be (14:20 - 14:25)
there right because like playing in (14:23 - 14:28)
downtown Pasadena on the Sunday was (14:25 - 14:30)
pretty fun right there were there were (14:28 - 14:33)
people everywhere and and like I was (14:30 - 14:34)
just walking down and (14:33 - 14:37)
someone I I think I was wearing the the (14:34 - 14:38)
T-shirt so maybe that's how they knew (14:37 - 14:40)
but they were like oh did you know about (14:38 - 14:41)
basculin on rots and I was like oh yeah (14:40 - 14:43)
cheers I did thanks you know just that (14:41 - 14:44)
sort of stuff it was there was a real (14:43 - 14:46)
Community Spirit there and I can (14:44 - 14:48)
understand people doing that but there's (14:46 - 14:49)
a big difference between that and trying (14:48 - 14:51)
to actually show up to the stadium (14:49 - 14:55)
itself um I don't know what they they (14:51 - 14:58)
turned off the spawns around the stadium (14:55 - 14:59)
when you were outside the offense I (14:58 - 15:01)
don't know if that was new was that a (14:59 - 15:02)
new thing they did or they previous (15:01 - 15:05)
events they've done that at other events (15:02 - 15:07)
where they make a dead zone before you (15:05 - 15:09)
get in yeah and that wasn't even just (15:07 - 15:11)
for for non-ticket holders that was for (15:09 - 15:13)
everyone we were standing in the que for (15:11 - 15:15)
half an hour and the disappointing thing (15:13 - 15:16)
is then you're sping in the queue for (15:15 - 15:17)
half an hour and you can't play Pokemon (15:16 - 15:19)
go because you're just seeing nothing (15:17 - 15:21)
around you except the step the stops (15:19 - 15:23)
they in a distance but I understand why (15:21 - 15:26)
they did it it is nice though because it (15:23 - 15:28)
was technically a fenced sort of (15:26 - 15:29)
experience so not ticket holders really (15:28 - 15:33)
couldn't even get in uh more or less um (15:29 - 15:35)
to this event which was different than (15:33 - 15:37)
Vegas Vegas was just open uh you could (15:35 - 15:39)
walk across the street after enjoying (15:37 - 15:42)
the Subway sandwich and uh and hop into (15:39 - 15:44)
the park I have no other reference to (15:42 - 15:45)
any other place around that I'm just (15:44 - 15:47)
going to keep referencing it uh but yeah (15:45 - 15:49)
this was not the case there was cues and (15:47 - 15:51)
Security checks and all sorts of stuff (15:49 - 15:53)
and and it was offened in golf course so (15:51 - 15:55)
well this is why I felt silly cuz I was (15:53 - 15:58)
like why would you have to go through (15:55 - 16:00)
the gate into the Stadium because the (15:58 - 16:03)
stadium itself had really nothing in it (16:00 - 16:05)
like like if you look at the map (16:03 - 16:06)
everything is on the golf course and I (16:05 - 16:08)
was like why would you have to get in (16:06 - 16:09)
line to go into the stadium to then go (16:08 - 16:11)
to the golf course but the golf course (16:09 - 16:13)
was gated in so what we're saying is (16:11 - 16:15)
this event was a gated event which was (16:13 - 16:18)
not like Vegas which was walk anywhere (16:15 - 16:21)
which was not like the second or third (16:18 - 16:23)
time they did Chicago which was walk (16:21 - 16:26)
anywhere but it is similar to Osaka (16:23 - 16:29)
which I went to for go Fest um (16:26 - 16:33)
which was in a stadium well the Expo 96 (16:29 - 16:36)
Park which was gated which also had a (16:33 - 16:38)
line that you had to stand in which we (16:36 - 16:39)
could argue we could sit here and spend (16:38 - 16:41)
the next hour arguing that Japanese (16:39 - 16:42)
people are way more efficient at (16:41 - 16:44)
standing in a line than American people (16:42 - 16:46)
this is there's really no debate there (16:44 - 16:48)
honestly um yeah I was about to say I (16:46 - 16:49)
don't think we're going to argue very (16:48 - 16:50)
much on that at (16:49 - 16:54)
all and then the Berlin Park for go Fest (16:50 - 16:57)
which was two years ago now also was (16:54 - 16:59)
gated but it was like (16:57 - 17:01)
if you were a ticket holder to that Park (16:59 - 17:02)
you could go in (17:01 - 17:04)
regardless uh but that Park had like (17:02 - 17:07)
eight entrances as well the this park (17:04 - 17:11)
for La had one entrance and then the the (17:07 - 17:13)
J the Japanese Osaka Park had one (17:11 - 17:17)
entrance so it's it's you solve a (17:13 - 17:20)
problem by like not overloading your (17:17 - 17:23)
server by having a gated entrance and (17:20 - 17:24)
then you don't come off as Petty being (17:23 - 17:27)
like don't come to this public place but (17:24 - 17:31)
then you you have the line issue which (17:27 - 17:32)
is (17:31 - 17:35)
like I believe they did open more gates (17:32 - 17:37)
for the Sunday so I don't know they did (17:35 - 17:38)
yeah that's what I heard yeah I'm (17:37 - 17:40)
assuming the lines were better on Sunday (17:38 - 17:43)
yeah I was there around 9: and it was (17:40 - 17:45)
just a completely different picture okay (17:43 - 17:47)
cuz when yeah cuz when we arrived at 9: (17:45 - 17:49)
like it took us 10 minutes to find the (17:47 - 17:50)
end of the (17:49 - 17:53)
queue in the first place it was it was (17:50 - 17:55)
it was as far as the I could see four (17:53 - 17:57)
different times going backwards and (17:55 - 18:00)
forwards and it was the same (17:57 - 18:02)
thing this is like Steve was right it (18:00 - 18:04)
was the same thing that I said like two (18:02 - 18:06)
months ago that I bet that the stadium (18:04 - 18:08)
would be G I thought the stadium would (18:06 - 18:10)
just be like the the Gated entrance to (18:08 - 18:12)
get into the stadium but you it was just (18:10 - 18:14)
like Osaka you had to show your phone (18:12 - 18:15)
you had to show that you had the the (18:14 - 18:17)
ticket and then they would they would (18:15 - 18:21)
let you in and it's like like niantic's (18:17 - 18:24)
apology for people waiting in line on (18:21 - 18:27)
Saturday was to extend City play from 5: (18:24 - 18:30)
to 8 which I think was like a (18:27 - 18:34)
good like solution like cool I waited (18:30 - 18:35)
like I don't think anyone waited in line (18:34 - 18:38)
for more than 30 to 40 minutes so to be (18:35 - 18:39)
like you're waiting in line to get in (18:38 - 18:41)
the park but we're giving you three more (18:39 - 18:45)
hours of content was I think a good (18:41 - 18:48)
compromise so it is but I think it kind (18:45 - 18:50)
of begs the question after years of of (18:48 - 18:52)
that kind of being the solution do you (18:50 - 18:53)
think they're getting too comfortable (18:52 - 18:55)
with (18:53 - 18:55)
that because like I I would I would say (18:56 - 19:00)
no I would say no on this event because (18:58 - 19:03)
the the quick pivot on Sunday shows that (19:00 - 19:06)
they're willing oh yeah okay it's it's (19:03 - 19:07)
not like it's not like they just went oh (19:06 - 19:09)
we'll just we'll do the same thing (19:07 - 19:11)
tomorrow and then just apologize again (19:09 - 19:12)
right they went no no we're actually (19:11 - 19:14)
going to change it I guess the problem (19:12 - 19:18)
is and this is I think most people I (19:14 - 19:20)
suspect would want to see this happening (19:18 - 19:22)
where they keep changing locations right (19:20 - 19:24)
they've done that so many different (19:22 - 19:27)
times um but it does lead to the problem (19:24 - 19:29)
where they can't be 100% sure how it's (19:27 - 19:31)
going to work in each different location (19:29 - 19:34)
um you could argue maybe they should (19:31 - 19:37)
have anticipated the fact that six (19:34 - 19:39)
people checking to go in is not enough (19:37 - 19:42)
people when there's what 10,000 people (19:39 - 19:45)
going to an event yeah did we get (19:42 - 19:47)
numbers how many people attended this I (19:45 - 19:50)
haven't seen them not that I've seen no (19:47 - 19:52)
but but like how do you stress test that (19:50 - 19:54)
right the capacity of it I mean I guess (19:52 - 19:56)
you kind of like ask the venue hey we're (19:54 - 19:58)
expecting X number of people we know (19:56 - 20:00)
you've had events here that exceed that (19:58 - 20:02)
what can we expect and then that's all (20:00 - 20:03)
they can go off of because they can (20:02 - 20:04)
stress test their network but they can't (20:03 - 20:06)
stress test like tens of thousands of (20:04 - 20:09)
people trying to get in the line right (20:06 - 20:10)
yeah I guess you just assume that people (20:09 - 20:12)
are all going to turn up at the same (20:10 - 20:13)
time and then go well we need to make (20:12 - 20:15)
sure there's as much opportunity as (20:13 - 20:17)
possible for people to get through what (20:15 - 20:18)
didn't they (20:17 - 20:20)
have and this is this is just my (20:18 - 20:23)
ignorance for getting a free ticket and (20:20 - 20:24)
not really looking at it was there not (20:23 - 20:27)
like an early bird like get there at 9: (20:24 - 20:28)
and then was there not like a get there (20:27 - 20:30)
at 10 ticket no there was just a (20:28 - 20:32)
Saturday and a Sunday Ticket oh okay the (20:30 - 20:35)
we interestingly well this is the other (20:32 - 20:36)
thing I'm a little bit confused by you (20:35 - 20:38)
had to say where you were starting so (20:36 - 20:40)
you would either choose the stadium or (20:38 - 20:42)
the golf course but there was only ever (20:40 - 20:44)
one entrance in the end yes yeah that (20:42 - 20:46)
was confusing it's like they changed (20:44 - 20:47)
their mind at the end and they were (20:46 - 20:50)
going to do one at the top um where was (20:47 - 20:52)
a bubbling Meer was uh and then they (20:50 - 20:53)
changed their mind and they were just (20:52 - 20:55)
going to do the one at the bottom so (20:53 - 20:56)
that was a bit weird because we we were (20:55 - 20:58)
arriving we're like I assume this is our (20:56 - 21:01)
queue because we were a stadium entrance (20:58 - 21:03)
but I can't see the other queue I don't (21:01 - 21:04)
know there's no signs for that that was (21:03 - 21:06)
a bit confusing what was interesting in (21:04 - 21:08)
Osaka and I would love to see Niantic (21:06 - 21:11)
maybe adopt this for future events is (21:08 - 21:13)
and this solves the problem of like too (21:11 - 21:18)
many people or a line is that um it (21:13 - 21:20)
wouldn't be nice if there was like a (21:18 - 21:22)
staggered roll out like you can buy the (21:20 - 21:24)
9:00 am ticket and then you leave at 5 (21:22 - 21:26)
you can buy the the 10 a.m. ticket and (21:24 - 21:29)
you leave at six you can buy the (21:26 - 21:31)
um 11:00 a.m. because I don't want to be (21:29 - 21:34)
up at 9: I I don't that's so early (21:31 - 21:36)
especially like when you're walking (21:34 - 21:37)
eight hours and you're like I gotta do (21:36 - 21:40)
it again tomorrow like I I would I would (21:37 - 21:42)
like to get there at like 10 or 11 and (21:40 - 21:44)
then have that late later experience and (21:42 - 21:45)
I'm sure there are parents that are like (21:44 - 21:47)
I want to be back at five I want to put (21:45 - 21:49)
the kids to bed like they want the early (21:47 - 21:51)
experience but I think that alleviates (21:49 - 21:53)
that thing and also they can just simply (21:51 - 21:57)
do it like in Osaka you if if you were (21:53 - 21:59)
in the park at the the morning part so (21:57 - 22:01)
like 10 to two and then it was like 2 to (21:59 - 22:03)
6 or whatever because they have done (22:01 - 22:06)
that before your spawns just completely (22:03 - 22:09)
shut off and then they were just like (22:06 - 22:11)
here's the exit and everyone just exited (22:09 - 22:13)
to go into the City and once you left (22:11 - 22:15)
that Stadium like your spawns came back (22:13 - 22:18)
because they Geo fenced yeah the park (22:15 - 22:20)
and so it was like you could be like oh (22:18 - 22:22)
my thing ends at 6 but I'm going to stay (22:20 - 22:24)
here till like you could but you you (22:22 - 22:25)
don't have any spawns (22:24 - 22:28)
anymore so yeah it was (22:25 - 22:31)
having everyone just show up at night (22:28 - 22:34)
was like I don't know not the best it (22:31 - 22:35)
wasn't like the worst but it it wasn't (22:34 - 22:38)
the best yeah I mean I def I would have (22:35 - 22:41)
turned up earlier if if I could have (22:38 - 22:43)
started the event earlier you know (22:41 - 22:45)
especially being on Pacific Time you (22:43 - 22:50)
know 8:00 9:00 Pacific time is what 8 (22:45 - 22:54)
hours later than 9 o' here so yeah I (22:50 - 22:57)
think I think it's good sorry I think as (22:54 - 22:59)
good of an idea as that is though I (22:57 - 23:01)
think logistically from for them like (22:59 - 23:03)
they'd have to pay people to work longer (23:01 - 23:05)
and then they'd have to have people (23:03 - 23:07)
managing that those waves and and (23:05 - 23:09)
understand how that works at the gates (23:07 - 23:11)
and stuff um I don't know what that (23:09 - 23:12)
looks like though on their back end if (23:11 - 23:14)
that's worth it or (23:12 - 23:18)
not I feel like you get well at least (23:14 - 23:21)
with the city the the go Fest thing of (23:18 - 23:22)
like four hours in the park four hours (23:21 - 23:24)
in the city which they did for Seattle (23:22 - 23:26)
yeah I think they did for New (23:24 - 23:30)
York they can get more people into it (23:26 - 23:32)
technically because they're rotating (23:30 - 23:34)
out (23:32 - 23:36)
however I mean technically I I I don't (23:34 - 23:38)
think it's that difficult right they (23:36 - 23:39)
give a different medal to different (23:38 - 23:40)
people and then the medal decides what (23:39 - 23:42)
happens right like that's that's not a (23:40 - 23:44)
particularly difficult thing to do we've (23:42 - 23:46)
they've shown they can do that as Steve (23:44 - 23:48)
says with the the morning and evening (23:46 - 23:50)
ones I do (23:48 - 23:52)
think I I I think it's interesting that (23:50 - 23:54)
this didn't do the same way that goest (23:52 - 23:55)
did with the morning and the afternoon (23:54 - 23:59)
it was a whole day event um and I don't (23:55 - 24:00)
know whether that's because they want it (23:59 - 24:03)
to be different from go Fest or whether (24:00 - 24:05)
they were expecting fewer (24:03 - 24:07)
people but I think the other thing about (24:05 - 24:09)
staggering it is I'm not sure it would (24:07 - 24:10)
actually reduce the number of people (24:09 - 24:12)
coming at one time because it would just (24:10 - 24:13)
mean they could sell more (24:12 - 24:16)
tickets right that's true that's true (24:13 - 24:18)
yeah which would be a legitimate reason (24:16 - 24:20)
for them doing it if they wanted to do (24:18 - 24:21)
that but I don't think it would solve (24:20 - 24:23)
the problem we're trying to solve here (24:21 - 24:26)
they did sell out uh both days and I (24:23 - 24:28)
think it's funny cuz this is this was (24:26 - 24:31)
the thing that happened in Vegas where (24:28 - 24:34)
like you saw like a handful of people (24:31 - 24:36)
tweeting that it was the worst event (24:34 - 24:39)
ever or everything was down but like for (24:36 - 24:41)
the people that were there like they had (24:39 - 24:44)
a good time and like not defending (24:41 - 24:46)
Niantic like the first like two hours (24:44 - 24:48)
were really shaky to get back onto the (24:46 - 24:50)
network and to establish that and we (24:48 - 24:51)
already established why the network went (24:50 - 24:54)
down because 10,000 extra people showed (24:51 - 24:57)
up um but I think it's funny this time (24:54 - 24:58)
around when I was looking on Tik Tok or (24:57 - 25:01)
social media or like Twitter and stuff (24:58 - 25:02)
that there was just pictures of what (25:01 - 25:05)
looked to be like a semi empty stadium (25:02 - 25:06)
and then people were like oh what a dead (25:05 - 25:08)
game look at how many people showed up (25:06 - 25:10)
but it like no one was in the stadium (25:08 - 25:12)
because there was nothing to do in the (25:10 - 25:14)
stadium the only two things in the (25:12 - 25:15)
stadium were like getting your picture (25:14 - 25:18)
with Diga and palia and then um getting (25:15 - 25:20)
your picture with Pikachu or Eevee and (25:18 - 25:22)
that was like they only came out at (25:20 - 25:24)
certain times and there was like one (25:22 - 25:26)
Poké stop in the very middle of the (25:24 - 25:27)
stadium that you could reach if you were (25:26 - 25:29)
sitting on the featers but like spawns (25:27 - 25:31)
were pretty light in the stadium which (25:29 - 25:35)
kind of make I think was so that like (25:31 - 25:37)
you were there for pictures and not (25:35 - 25:39)
necessarily for that but as soon as you (25:37 - 25:42)
walked out of the stadium like all (25:39 - 25:45)
around the stadium was the first uh what (25:42 - 25:48)
do they call that zone habitat which was (25:45 - 25:50)
theit yeah Seaside (25:48 - 25:53)
Metropolis um which I think had like the (25:50 - 25:55)
best spawns of the event and all you had (25:53 - 25:57)
to do was like walk around the stadium (25:55 - 25:58)
in a circle (25:57 - 26:01)
um which had like the Shellos and the (25:58 - 26:05)
phon and the other Shellos and whatever (26:01 - 26:08)
other Seaside poron come on yeah Porygon (26:05 - 26:10)
is a real Banger of a (26:08 - 26:14)
Pokemon very watery yeah we we went into (26:10 - 26:16)
the stadium twice we when we arrived it (26:14 - 26:17)
was like all right well let's go (26:16 - 26:18)
straight into the stadium and then we (26:17 - 26:22)
went in and were like no no this is not (26:18 - 26:24)
where we want to be and then we came (26:22 - 26:27)
back with lunch to sit down that that (26:24 - 26:29)
was it the the only two times we wenten (26:27 - 26:32)
in the stadium um I wasn't wasting time (26:29 - 26:35)
getting picture with with some models (26:32 - 26:36)
when we could be catching Pokemon you (26:35 - 26:40)
know we got those horses to get that's (26:36 - 26:42)
right I I don't know how you felt about (26:40 - 26:44)
the layout of this event compared to (26:42 - 26:48)
Vegas Chris but I didn't love how it was (26:44 - 26:50)
laid out it didn't like make or break (26:48 - 26:53)
the event for me I was just I I didn't (26:50 - 26:54)
like walking to a dead end and being (26:53 - 26:57)
like okay we got to turn around yeah I (26:54 - 26:58)
think they could have done a better job (26:57 - 26:59)
of it feeling more like a loop instead (26:58 - 27:02)
of like a line um like go Fest in (26:59 - 27:04)
Lincoln Park was also long and narrow (27:02 - 27:06)
like that I think it was longer than (27:04 - 27:08)
this was because this was uh I was (27:06 - 27:10)
hearing people say a mile from stem to (27:08 - 27:14)
stern of this park right um but yeah I (27:10 - 27:16)
think I think Lincoln Park was a mile (27:14 - 27:18)
and some change but um yeah this (27:16 - 27:20)
definitely did feel like almost like a (27:18 - 27:22)
relay race like you run to the end you (27:20 - 27:24)
touch the fence and then you get to walk (27:22 - 27:27)
back um but you know there was there was (27:24 - 27:29)
a couple of there was like two halves if (27:27 - 27:30)
you were really paying attention to the (27:29 - 27:33)
paved paths there was like one on the (27:30 - 27:34)
left you could have gone up and then you (27:33 - 27:35)
could have turned around and take the (27:34 - 27:38)
other one on the left then to walk back (27:35 - 27:41)
but it it didn't feel like a loop either (27:38 - 27:43)
way yeah I I'm a little bit confused (27:41 - 27:45)
obviously I've not been to other ones (27:43 - 27:46)
either I I don't know whether they were (27:45 - 27:48)
limited in what area they were allowed (27:46 - 27:50)
to use like whether they were using (27:48 - 27:51)
because there was that river through the (27:50 - 27:53)
middle so maybe they were told you have (27:51 - 27:55)
to stay to the other side of the river (27:53 - 27:58)
to make it simple to stop get to the (27:55 - 28:00)
here it wasn't it wasn't a river it was (27:58 - 28:05)
like okay a stream La sewer run (28:00 - 28:07)
off that water was (28:05 - 28:10)
moving was moving a good clip (28:07 - 28:14)
yeah um but like if you just take that (28:10 - 28:16)
like top section and put it to the right (28:14 - 28:19)
of the the third one it would have been (28:16 - 28:21)
essentially a square and would have felt (28:19 - 28:24)
much better I agree it was like you you (28:21 - 28:26)
you didn't really want to go to the top (28:24 - 28:29)
section not least cuz there were no (28:26 - 28:32)
toilets at the top and and then also you (28:29 - 28:34)
just felt like I'm walking away from (28:32 - 28:36)
everything rather than walking to some (28:34 - 28:39)
other things yeah so like looking at the (28:36 - 28:41)
map and I don't know if this is just (28:39 - 28:43)
because it wasn't part of their official (28:41 - 28:44)
path but it doesn't look like there was (28:43 - 28:46)
a bridge I see it looks like there are (28:44 - 28:48)
some paths that are crossing that must (28:46 - 28:50)
have been closed off but like on their (28:48 - 28:52)
official map they only have those three (28:50 - 28:54)
foot bridges over that like little (28:52 - 28:57)
Waterway right at the bottom there so (28:54 - 28:59)
it's like kind of a commitment to go all (28:57 - 29:01)
the way up to bubbling Meer to maybe get (28:59 - 29:04)
a stunky and then walk all the way back (29:01 - 29:06)
yeah I suspect is just not telling us (29:04 - 29:08)
about the bridges that didn't exist (29:06 - 29:09)
because they didn't need yeah I think (29:08 - 29:14)
you're right I I was not 100% sold on (29:09 - 29:15)
the the concept of like let's have this (29:14 - 29:18)
at a stadium and then now that we've (29:15 - 29:19)
cleared that like the event wasn't (29:18 - 29:21)
actually in the stadium it was like (29:19 - 29:22)
around the (29:21 - 29:26)
stadium near a stadium near a stadium (29:22 - 29:29)
but I will say that the cool thing here (29:26 - 29:31)
compared to Vegas (29:29 - 29:34)
and I didn't have this problem in the (29:31 - 29:36)
Osaka experience I don't know about New (29:34 - 29:39)
York but because it was a stadium they (29:36 - 29:42)
had all the stadium restaurants open uh (29:39 - 29:45)
so you get like hot dogs nachos Burgers (29:42 - 29:48)
pizza and because there were so many (29:45 - 29:50)
around the stadium lines were relatively (29:48 - 29:54)
short now they did have food trucks and (29:50 - 29:55)
I don't know if people at a certain (29:54 - 29:57)
point forgot or walk through the stadium (29:55 - 29:58)
and never looked looked around but the (29:57 - 30:01)
food truck lines were like four times (29:58 - 30:04)
longer and I don't know who was waiting (30:01 - 30:06)
like maybe it was like slightly better (30:04 - 30:09)
food I I think it's just because people (30:06 - 30:11)
there's much more of an Allure to a food (30:09 - 30:14)
truck in an event than it is going to a (30:11 - 30:16)
stand and getting like a stadium hot dog (30:14 - 30:18)
or a slice of pizza I think that's (30:16 - 30:21)
that's really just it you know I I also (30:18 - 30:23)
wouldn't be surprised if some people (30:21 - 30:25)
went into the stadium went oh this isn't (30:23 - 30:26)
really where the event is and then went (30:25 - 30:28)
straight through to the park and didn't (30:26 - 30:32)
realize that around the stadium was (30:28 - 30:35)
actually a good place to be sometimes as (30:32 - 30:37)
well and therefore they weren't really (30:35 - 30:38)
paying attention to that and when they (30:37 - 30:39)
came back to get food they saw the food (30:38 - 30:42)
trucks I think it's I see a place that (30:39 - 30:44)
has food I go there and that's the first (30:42 - 30:46)
place you see so you go there because (30:44 - 30:49)
the first restaurant in the stadium as (30:46 - 30:52)
well also had that issue and I was (30:49 - 30:54)
guilty I saw that and I went oh there we (30:52 - 30:56)
go I'm going to go there because that (30:54 - 30:58)
the q's already long let me get in that (30:56 - 31:01)
queue I'll eat something from there and (30:58 - 31:02)
it turned out that was the longest queue (31:01 - 31:04)
in the stadium and I could if I just (31:02 - 31:06)
walked a few minutes later I could have (31:04 - 31:08)
got food in a tenth of the (31:06 - 31:11)
time yeah so we were walk we were doing (31:08 - 31:13)
laps around it on Sunday Steve I wasn't (31:11 - 31:15)
sure if this about what you about to oh (31:13 - 31:17)
yeah yeah the other side first of all (31:15 - 31:19)
ashwat hidden from public sight back (31:17 - 31:22)
there uh and then there were like two or (31:19 - 31:25)
three stands at like nobody in line it's (31:22 - 31:27)
just like oh if we had maybe just walked (31:25 - 31:28)
for (31:27 - 31:29)
yeah this this was like the weird part (31:28 - 31:32)
of the layout because they put spawns (31:29 - 31:33)
all around the stadium so if you were (31:32 - 31:35)
just like I want to get shos I want to (31:33 - 31:37)
get fine in so I'm going to stay in this (31:35 - 31:39)
area which is like a good strategy like (31:37 - 31:41)
I was I spent way too much time in the (31:39 - 31:45)
desert in Vegas which was an actual (31:41 - 31:48)
desert I spent way too much time in (31:45 - 31:50)
Vegas's desert trying to get in ncata (31:48 - 31:51)
because that's what I wanted I like I (31:50 - 31:53)
was like I have everything else I want (31:51 - 31:56)
ncata so I was like I want both Shellos (31:53 - 31:58)
so I want I want two Blues I want two (31:56 - 32:00)
pinks I'm gonna just keep walking in a (31:58 - 32:02)
circle for the stadium which I did with (32:00 - 32:05)
Chris on Sunday and because of the way (32:02 - 32:08)
the park is laid out no one went to the (32:05 - 32:11)
right side of the stadium because you (32:08 - 32:12)
you go left and then left leads you into (32:11 - 32:14)
the golf course and then once you're in (32:12 - 32:16)
the golf course you either commit to (32:14 - 32:17)
going to the end of the golf course and (32:16 - 32:21)
then commit coming back but when we went (32:17 - 32:23)
to the right there was like picture (32:21 - 32:24)
opportunities there that had like no (32:23 - 32:26)
lines there were so many food things (32:24 - 32:28)
that had no lines bathrooms with no (32:26 - 32:30)
lines and there was just not a lot of (32:28 - 32:33)
people over there even though the spawn (32:30 - 32:36)
density over there was great it was (32:33 - 32:39)
awesome (32:36 - 32:39)
yeah um and then the cool thing about (32:39 - 32:44)
the stadium is it offered unlimited (32:41 - 32:46)
seating which was like a problem in (32:44 - 32:49)
Vegas and other events of like okay cool (32:46 - 32:52)
I just spent $30 on really bad food (32:49 - 32:54)
where am I going to like sit to do this (32:52 - 32:55)
and like you could just walk in the (32:54 - 32:57)
stadium and sit on the bleachers and (32:55 - 32:59)
then eat your food it was really great (32:57 - 33:02)
um they like they did have picnic tables (32:59 - 33:05)
by the food trucks but like 9 12 picnic (33:02 - 33:08)
tables like not nearly enough for the (33:05 - 33:14)
course um but I kind of like the stadium (33:08 - 33:17)
concept I kind of like having way more (33:14 - 33:21)
bathrooms way more food options and way (33:17 - 33:24)
more seating for really like not losing (33:21 - 33:27)
anything on that although yeah picture (33:24 - 33:29)
wise it does make it look weird of like (33:27 - 33:30)
why is the stadium so empty and it's (33:29 - 33:32)
like oh cuz everyone is in the golf (33:30 - 33:34)
course that's why yeah optically that (33:32 - 33:36)
was a little bit strange but like once (33:34 - 33:37)
you once you're there you're like oh (33:36 - 33:39)
it's just for these blowup pelia and (33:37 - 33:42)
Diaga pictures really right but yeah I I (33:39 - 33:44)
would agree from an amenity standpoint (33:42 - 33:47)
it was a lifesaver a GameChanger even (33:44 - 33:49)
like I I almost feel bad comparing this (33:47 - 33:52)
to Vegas because it was so different you (33:49 - 33:55)
know like there was there was shade the (33:52 - 33:57)
trees were taller so they cast longer sh (33:55 - 34:01)
Shadows than they did in (33:57 - 34:04)
vas here's here's my one like thing I (34:01 - 34:07)
liked about Vegas compared to this is (34:04 - 34:10)
Vegas because it was like a public (34:07 - 34:14)
park they had really big (34:10 - 34:16)
sidewalks like to the point where you (34:14 - 34:20)
could fit like three wheelchairs like (34:16 - 34:21)
next to each other and push them at the (34:20 - 34:23)
same time like that's how that's how I (34:21 - 34:25)
would imagine it here I felt like if a (34:23 - 34:27)
wheelchair exist like were people in (34:25 - 34:28)
wheelchairs by the way that's why I'm (34:27 - 34:30)
using this example the wheelchair would (34:28 - 34:32)
take up the entire walking path because (34:30 - 34:35)
it's a golf course (34:32 - 34:38)
and most of those golfers are in little (34:35 - 34:42)
carts anyways they're not like using the (34:38 - 34:45)
walking path so it resulted in you (34:42 - 34:48)
walking on the grass and while like that (34:45 - 34:49)
doesn't sound bad at first because (34:48 - 34:50)
you're probably like oh why would I (34:49 - 34:52)
would want to walk in the grass anyway (34:50 - 34:55)
because it's softer like golf courses (34:52 - 34:58)
are not very flat (34:55 - 35:00)
they're very uneven and the amount of (34:58 - 35:02)
people you can blame Niantic if you want (35:00 - 35:04)
I think you blame the people but the (35:02 - 35:06)
amount of people I saw like fall like (35:04 - 35:08)
fall or trip over like little divots or (35:06 - 35:09)
holes in the golf course because that's (35:08 - 35:11)
just what it was like and they weren't (35:09 - 35:15)
paying attention it was a lot she's like (35:11 - 35:18)
oh this is there's just a hole here my (35:15 - 35:20)
left ankle saw its life flash before its (35:18 - 35:23)
eyes at least twice (35:20 - 35:25)
yes were you were you standing next to (35:23 - 35:28)
me when that girl was the high heels she (35:25 - 35:30)
had a very cute outfit by the way but (35:28 - 35:33)
she was wearing high heels and she like (35:30 - 35:34)
she got sucked into one of those holes (35:33 - 35:38)
and she went down and it was I was not (35:34 - 35:40)
no I heard your impassioned retelling of (35:38 - 35:42)
the story but I was sadly not (35:40 - 35:45)
there it was one of those things too (35:42 - 35:48)
where like it was like a silent fall but (35:45 - 35:52)
like the pain was very on the face of (35:48 - 35:55)
like I think you I think you sprained (35:52 - 35:59)
your ankle I don't but also maybe like I (35:55 - 36:00)
don't want to be like don't wear high (35:59 - 36:04)
heels to a golf course but like I mean I (36:00 - 36:07)
I look okay I know fashion is important (36:04 - 36:09)
to a lot of people but I would say maybe (36:07 - 36:12)
don't wear high heels to a walking event (36:09 - 36:14)
that that's that's all I would say it's (36:12 - 36:16)
if the sidewalks were bigger though no (36:14 - 36:20)
but even like walking for eight hours in (36:16 - 36:23)
high heels no matter what surface it on (36:20 - 36:25)
that sounds like a recipe for disaster (36:23 - 36:28)
to me I don't know she I'm going to take (36:25 - 36:29)
the uh position of applauding this (36:28 - 36:31)
person for their courage and their (36:29 - 36:33)
bravery to to set myself apart from you (36:31 - 36:35)
two right (36:33 - 36:38)
now hey I said she had a fantastic (36:35 - 36:40)
outfit I'm very concerned about her (36:38 - 36:44)
ankle all (36:40 - 36:44)
right okay uh let's let's take a break (36:45 - 36:50)
and then we'll when we come back we'll (36:49 - 36:53)
talk about the shiny odds because I feel (36:50 - 36:55)
like that's how people value some of (36:53 - 36:58)
these events um or like uh they they (36:55 - 37:01)
really cranked up the humongo button so (36:58 - 37:06)
we'll we'll talk about that when we come (37:01 - 37:06)
back and we are back from our break uh (37:14 - 37:22)
okay uh I feel like they they had big (37:19 - 37:23)
and (37:22 - 37:26)
small before the last go Fest right I (37:23 - 37:29)
think they did yes (37:26 - 37:32)
yes not not before the last tour but I (37:29 - 37:34)
think before go Fest yeah they didn't (37:32 - 37:36)
have it for Vegas but I think they (37:34 - 37:39)
introduced it after that uh for whatever (37:36 - 37:41)
reason I don't think it was a bad thing (37:39 - 37:45)
Niantic cranked up the jumbo (37:41 - 37:45)
size I was wrong it was December 2022 it (37:46 - 37:52)
was de well yeah they did do it for (37:49 - 37:54)
Vegas I don't remember running into any (37:52 - 37:56)
jumbo so that's when it that's when it (37:54 - 37:57)
first came out but remember it was (37:56 - 38:00)
limited to specific species for a period (37:57 - 38:02)
of time too oh yeah they launched it for (38:00 - 38:05)
pump kaboo didn't they yeah yeah then I (38:02 - 38:07)
remember like houndour was one of their (38:05 - 38:10)
selected species for a bit and exciting (38:07 - 38:14)
Pokemon something like that (38:10 - 38:18)
yeah I got so I have up to this point (38:14 - 38:20)
I've never transferred to Jumbo Pokemon (38:18 - 38:21)
because I I like them and I think (38:20 - 38:24)
they're cool and I was like and then (38:21 - 38:26)
showcases existed and I was like well (38:24 - 38:29)
you need the jum for showcases but I got (38:26 - 38:33)
so many Jumbo Pokemon this weekend that (38:29 - 38:35)
I I don't know what to do now now I feel (38:33 - 38:37)
like I have to start throwing them (38:35 - 38:40)
away but they like didn't crank up tiny (38:37 - 38:43)
like I got I did get tiny Pokemon but I (38:40 - 38:45)
felt like I got like three four times as (38:43 - 38:47)
many jumpo Pokemon than I did Tiny I (38:45 - 38:50)
think this is just their continual (38:47 - 38:54)
uh being against tiny Pokemon right cuz (38:50 - 38:57)
they I'm pretty sure when showcas were (38:54 - 38:59)
announced they were like different (38:57 - 39:01)
criteria sometimes it'll be big (38:59 - 39:02)
sometimes it'll be small and we never (39:01 - 39:05)
got the small so they clearly just hate (39:02 - 39:07)
tiny Pokemon so I think that's why I (39:05 - 39:09)
heard somebody mention that it might (39:07 - 39:12)
might have been a reference to uh Alpha (39:09 - 39:14)
Pokemon in (39:12 - 39:16)
Legends yeah and I was like that's a (39:14 - 39:18)
stretch but also I like that so that's (39:16 - 39:20)
head Cannon now absolutely niantic's (39:18 - 39:22)
like yes that was that's what we were (39:20 - 39:25)
doing the entire time we meant that (39:22 - 39:27)
yeah (39:25 - 39:31)
there po I definitely hit the point a (39:27 - 39:32)
few months ago where I started (39:31 - 39:35)
transferring jumbos um and yeah this (39:32 - 39:38)
weekend was was even worse like I (39:35 - 39:42)
think I do I don't want to sound like (39:38 - 39:44)
one of those people that says that oh (39:42 - 39:46)
shinies have been devalued because (39:44 - 39:48)
they're so common now because no they're (39:46 - 39:52)
still fun but I do feel like the number (39:48 - 39:53)
of XXL that I (39:52 - 39:56)
get lessens the excitement of them for (39:53 - 39:58)
for me and I'm now at the point where (39:56 - 40:01)
I'm just keeping ones that I find (39:58 - 40:03)
particularly interesting so I think for (40:01 - 40:07)
example I kept uh I kept a jumbo uh (40:03 - 40:09)
growth because I think that's a fun one (40:07 - 40:11)
to me and I kept all of my tinies (40:09 - 40:13)
because tinies are always fun right it's (40:11 - 40:16)
so teeny tiny uh but yeah there's very (40:13 - 40:19)
few of the jumbo ones I'm keeping (40:16 - 40:19)
anymore yeah I think the experience of (40:20 - 40:25)
catching an XXL Pokemon is more exciting (40:22 - 40:27)
to me than actually keeping them like I (40:25 - 40:29)
like the animation a lot I'm like oh (40:27 - 40:32)
it's big look at that that's great and (40:29 - 40:33)
then I put it in my box and I'm like (40:32 - 40:35)
I've got six of these and they're all (40:33 - 40:37)
big okay the smallest one can go I guess (40:35 - 40:38)
that's (40:37 - 40:41)
fine yeah I got a jumbo Spirit tomb I (40:38 - 40:43)
was pretty hyped about it I didn't I (40:41 - 40:46)
didn't I didn't get a shiny Spirit tomb (40:43 - 40:48)
uh but the jumbo one made me feel (40:46 - 40:51)
slightly better did you finish all the (40:48 - 40:56)
research for it yeah I did all 10 oh man (40:51 - 40:57)
man (40:56 - 40:58)
I didn't I didn't get it I got the (40:57 - 41:00)
Spinda though for Vegas which I feel (40:58 - 41:03)
like a lot of people didn't get yeah (41:00 - 41:05)
that was the case for me did not did not (41:03 - 41:06)
have luck with that that's one thing I (41:05 - 41:07)
kind of wanted to bring up here though (41:06 - 41:11)
is that um it's kind of easy to sort of (41:07 - 41:12)
like try to compare those two things the (41:11 - 41:15)
Spinda stops in Vegas and the spirit (41:12 - 41:17)
tomb stops in LA but they they function (41:15 - 41:20)
very very differently um so how how did (41:17 - 41:22)
we how do we feel about the spirit tomb (41:20 - 41:24)
stops I didn't get a big chance to play (41:22 - 41:27)
City play a lot so I was too short of (41:24 - 41:29)
finishing that research it still hurts (41:27 - 41:32)
me now several days later um but uh it (41:29 - 41:35)
was It was kind of (41:32 - 41:38)
cool yeah I think it was quite cool um (41:35 - 41:39)
having (41:38 - 41:44)
that ex experience of exploring the city (41:39 - 41:46)
and coming across one right like we (41:44 - 41:49)
found one in Venice Beach and it's like (41:46 - 41:51)
so far from the actual event but you're (41:49 - 41:52)
still seeing that there I think that's (41:51 - 41:55)
that's quite fun um and there I think (41:52 - 41:57)
there were enough of them right 108 is a (41:55 - 41:59)
pretty good number that you're going to (41:57 - 42:01)
see quite a few of them and I think they (41:59 - 42:03)
did there were was it four or was it (42:01 - 42:06)
five ones in the event itself four in (42:03 - 42:09)
the park four in the park and one in (42:06 - 42:12)
each biome right okay that makes sense (42:09 - 42:15)
and then there were quite a few of them (42:12 - 42:18)
in downtown Pasadena so if you didn't (42:15 - 42:19)
explore La a huge amount and you just (42:18 - 42:22)
stuck to the event and downtown Pasadena (42:19 - 42:24)
you if if you didn't manage to complete (42:22 - 42:26)
it you certainly got close to it you (42:24 - 42:29)
certainly got more of them I think had (42:26 - 42:32)
six well okay so that so yeah so that (42:29 - 42:33)
that would have been 10 and that was (42:32 - 42:35)
completely walkable right like the the (42:33 - 42:37)
whole area is obviously huge but the (42:35 - 42:39)
actual downtown pastina area was was (42:37 - 42:41)
pretty walkable and quite nice to play (42:39 - 42:46)
in I I feel I I loved the spirit tomb (42:41 - 42:48)
stuff and I think I loved it more after (42:46 - 42:51)
I realized what they were doing I think (42:48 - 42:52)
like when so for those that don't know (42:51 - 42:57)
they put 108 Spirit tomb stops around La (42:52 - 42:59)
four of them obviously in the stadium (42:57 - 43:03)
and like when like when Al got in on (42:59 - 43:06)
Friday we were with Al and then we were (43:03 - 43:09)
with tone and it was like we have so (43:06 - 43:11)
much we have limited time on the weekend (43:09 - 43:14)
right because we have we have to go to (43:11 - 43:17)
the park and then we have to go to (43:14 - 43:19)
Pasadena like we're like how many (43:17 - 43:21)
touristy things can we do before the (43:19 - 43:23)
event so like we got to go to Santa (43:21 - 43:25)
Monica Beach because like they got to (43:23 - 43:26)
they got to see the beach they got to (43:25 - 43:27)
touch say they got to look at the ocean (43:26 - 43:29)
I don't care about any of that but I (43:27 - 43:30)
understand that's like the touristy (43:29 - 43:32)
thing to do right like we got to go to (43:30 - 43:34)
Santa Monica so like we spend 45 minutes (43:32 - 43:37)
in a car to get to Santa Monica we're (43:34 - 43:38)
there we're at Santa Monica for what (43:37 - 43:42)
like 90 minutes about and then F longer (43:38 - 43:45)
than that I don't think it was two hours (43:42 - 43:47)
but yeah we were there for maybe okay (43:45 - 43:49)
maybe like two hours we were there and (43:47 - 43:51)
then we get in a car and we drive two (43:49 - 43:53)
hours to Disney cuz that was like (43:51 - 43:55)
another thing people wanted to do it was (43:53 - 43:57)
2 and half hours (43:55 - 43:59)
cuz we left at 3 and we got there at 6 2 (43:57 - 44:02)
and a half hours I dreed every single (43:59 - 44:03)
second of (44:02 - 44:06)
that and being in the car sucks H but (44:03 - 44:08)
and those were very far apart but I was (44:06 - 44:10)
like when else are we going to get this (44:08 - 44:12)
many people together to like meet up (44:10 - 44:14)
because the weekend's going to get away (44:12 - 44:15)
from us so that was like the sacrifice (44:14 - 44:17)
we had to make and there were anyways (44:15 - 44:19)
there were spe tomb stops at Santa (44:17 - 44:22)
Monica and then they were at Disney (44:19 - 44:23)
which makes sense because those are two (44:22 - 44:25)
popular places to play in Pokémon go but (44:23 - 44:27)
I think why when the Spirit to stops (44:25 - 44:30)
actually like stood out to me is (44:27 - 44:34)
I it it rained on Monday it rained all (44:30 - 44:37)
day which is like rare for LA to (44:34 - 44:42)
experience rain so like when I when I (44:37 - 44:43)
accepted that okay it's going to rain (44:42 - 44:45)
all day what are we going to do I saw (44:43 - 44:48)
Tik Tock earlier in the week one good (44:45 - 44:50)
thing that Tik Tok is for and this this (44:48 - 44:52)
Tik Tok person is like if you don't have (44:50 - 44:54)
a lot of money I was like perfect and (44:52 - 44:56)
you're like on a time limit here here's (44:54 - 44:59)
like a good thing you can do in in La (44:56 - 45:01)
she was like you want to go to Grand (44:59 - 45:04)
Market and I was like perfect cuz that's (45:01 - 45:06)
like an indoor eating place like it's (45:04 - 45:07)
very similar to Milwaukee Public Market (45:06 - 45:09)
or like the Seattle Public Market and (45:07 - 45:11)
stuff she's like you want to go to Grand (45:09 - 45:12)
Market and then across the Street's like (45:11 - 45:14)
a little train you can take for a dollar (45:12 - 45:16)
and then down the street is like this (45:14 - 45:19)
huge bookstore library that you can go (45:16 - 45:21)
to and then over here is like the Disney (45:19 - 45:22)
Orchestra Hall that you can look at and (45:21 - 45:24)
then over here is like a museum and then (45:22 - 45:26)
over here is like where they filmed 500 (45:24 - 45:28)
Days of Summer and you can like do that (45:26 - 45:31)
and it's like you're barely outside like (45:28 - 45:32)
you're only outside to like walk from (45:31 - 45:34)
point A to p b and I was like this is (45:32 - 45:35)
actually perfect holy cow I can't (45:34 - 45:37)
believe I found this Tik Tok and the (45:35 - 45:40)
craziest thing is when I started doing (45:37 - 45:42)
those things of like going to Grand (45:40 - 45:44)
Market and then going to the bookstore (45:42 - 45:46)
and then going they were all Spirit (45:44 - 45:49)
tombs every single one of them was a (45:46 - 45:51)
spirit tomb and then I was like I'm just (45:49 - 45:53)
going to look at the map and it was just (45:51 - 45:56)
every Spirit tomb was like not just (45:53 - 45:59)
randomly placed they were placed at (45:56 - 46:01)
things that were like worth seeing or (45:59 - 46:04)
worth doing or like you got there if you (46:01 - 46:05)
got somewhere and you looked around and (46:04 - 46:07)
you were like this seems like there (46:05 - 46:08)
would be a spirit tomb there there there (46:07 - 46:11)
was like they were just so cleverly (46:08 - 46:13)
placed and I'm actually surprised maybe (46:11 - 46:15)
there is I don't maybe I don't watch a (46:13 - 46:16)
lot of YouTube I'm actually surprised (46:15 - 46:17)
there's not like a YouTuber of like I'm (46:16 - 46:20)
going to go to all eight 108 Spirit (46:17 - 46:22)
tombs and I'm going to show you what (46:20 - 46:24)
they are in like real cuz they've been (46:22 - 46:25)
out for like three weeks they they (46:24 - 46:29)
existed before before the event (46:25 - 46:29)
started um but they were all like (46:29 - 46:33)
notable places they were super super (46:31 - 46:36)
cool and and that makes when you think (46:33 - 46:38)
about it it makes perfect sense right (46:36 - 46:40)
because that's what Niantic actually say (46:38 - 46:43)
they care about it's about getting (46:40 - 46:45)
people outside and getting people to (46:43 - 46:47)
explore and sometimes we forget that and (46:45 - 46:48)
sometimes it's not as obvious and (46:47 - 46:50)
sometimes I think they forget that but (46:48 - 46:53)
that's what they continually tell us (46:50 - 46:55)
that they want to do and it works really (46:53 - 46:57)
well because that that's the thing that (46:55 - 46:59)
we spent the weekend other than the time (46:57 - 47:01)
we were actually at the event we spent (46:59 - 47:03)
the time being tourists and doing (47:01 - 47:05)
touristy things and we just happened (47:03 - 47:08)
upon these (47:05 - 47:08)
things yeah unfortunately I can't speak (47:08 - 47:11)
to it because I didn't really get to do (47:10 - 47:13)
City experience but in my Ubers I picked (47:11 - 47:18)
up at least four more so that was (47:13 - 47:18)
nice I mean the the spirit tube thing (47:20 - 47:24)
lends itself (47:23 - 47:27)
to the lore Spirit tomb right there's (47:24 - 47:29)
like 108 Souls that make up Spirit tomb (47:27 - 47:32)
so 108 Poké stops and La is big enough (47:29 - 47:34)
where that like fits perfectly I do (47:32 - 47:36)
wonder if there's like if there is like (47:34 - 47:40)
a Unova tour right you would one you (47:36 - 47:43)
would think it would be in New York but (47:40 - 47:45)
that doesn't really pan out New York in (47:43 - 47:47)
February maybe not the (47:45 - 47:50)
best place to be unless they do it (47:47 - 47:52)
inside like an expo hall like where (47:50 - 47:55)
Comic-Con is um but that would be a (47:52 - 47:58)
little weird cuz it be like all inside I (47:55 - 48:01)
don't know how they do that but like if (47:58 - 48:04)
I think the whole we're going to put (48:01 - 48:06)
notable Poké stops that you should go to (48:04 - 48:08)
to spin but we're lining that up with (48:06 - 48:10)
touristy things I think that's super (48:08 - 48:11)
smart and super (48:10 - 48:14)
clever I don't know I wonder if there's (48:11 - 48:15)
like a Pokemon in Gen 5 they can tie (48:14 - 48:19)
that to um cuz Spinda with Gen 3 made (48:15 - 48:20)
sense because like every pokop was like (48:19 - 48:21)
a (48:20 - 48:23)
different Spinda (48:21 - 48:26)
pattern so that was like oh I can't I (48:23 - 48:28)
need Spinda number seven and then people (48:26 - 48:30)
would be like ah it's in the desert (48:28 - 48:34)
under the cactus I can't think of what (48:30 - 48:35)
yovo would be I know that I know what (48:34 - 48:37)
callus would be I think they I think (48:35 - 48:40)
they add a they do Zygarde for that (48:37 - 48:41)
right because you've got the zygard oh (48:40 - 48:43)
zygard cells yeah oh man that'd be (48:41 - 48:45)
awesome it would it would work really (48:43 - 48:48)
well uh and it will have been what two (48:45 - 48:49)
two and a half years since they released (48:48 - 48:51)
saard so they would feel okay about (48:49 - 48:53)
making some more your zygard worthless (48:51 - 48:56)
like your shinies are worthless I'm (48:53 - 48:58)
totally fine with zygard being everybody (48:56 - 49:00)
should have a zygard zygard for (48:58 - 49:03)
everybody um yeah I'm not I'm not really (49:00 - 49:05)
seeing anything in this list that would (49:03 - 49:08)
work well but I would say that if they (49:05 - 49:10)
can't figure out a way to make it work (49:08 - 49:11)
nice (49:10 - 49:13)
thematically just do whatever right I (49:11 - 49:15)
think they should do that I what it (49:13 - 49:17)
doesn't matter what it is at the end of (49:15 - 49:19)
the day like if it's if you roll your (49:17 - 49:20)
eyes at it because it's like oh this (49:19 - 49:22)
Pokemon doesn't thematically make sense (49:20 - 49:25)
for this I think the advantages of what (49:22 - 49:28)
that was the exploration and the feeling (49:25 - 49:31)
like the whole city is part of that over (49:28 - 49:33)
overweighs the the eye rolling of it (49:31 - 49:37)
doesn't really doesn't really fit it (49:33 - 49:39)
but yeah I feel like the spendest stops (49:37 - 49:41)
definitely lent itself to the way that (49:39 - 49:43)
it was used really well and Vegas did (49:41 - 49:45)
not and this is really notable did not (49:43 - 49:47)
have a city uh exploration portion of it (49:45 - 49:50)
it was only the park experience um and (49:47 - 49:52)
you could play in the city but it wasn't (49:50 - 49:55)
advertised as like a city experience you (49:52 - 49:58)
just there were just spawns and stuff uh (49:55 - 50:00)
whereas in in La they were very clearly (49:58 - 50:01)
trying to entice you to go certain (50:00 - 50:05)
places to hunt down these stops um but (50:01 - 50:07)
if you had asked me like a month ago and (50:05 - 50:10)
pitched this idea about the 108 stops (50:07 - 50:12)
being throughout the city and then being (50:10 - 50:15)
at like locations that are important in (50:12 - 50:17)
some aspect like you would expect them (50:15 - 50:18)
to be Spirit tomb stops I would have (50:17 - 50:20)
said man that sounds like a lot of work (50:18 - 50:22)
I don't think they'll do that as cool of (50:20 - 50:24)
an idea as it is and they did anyway (50:22 - 50:26)
right so who knows I mean they could be (50:24 - 50:29)
really creative uh with the Unova tour (50:26 - 50:32)
um but if if they do a Unova tour (50:29 - 50:33)
something that is was missing from this (50:32 - 50:35)
and from last tour but was at Kanto and (50:33 - 50:39)
jotto I hope comes back um would be that (50:35 - 50:42)
collection challenge of the entire (50:39 - 50:45)
Pokedex yeah especially since you NOA is (50:42 - 50:47)
supposed to be like a reimagining of (50:45 - 50:49)
Kanto like we're starting over no (50:47 - 50:52)
Pokemon are going to be based off other (50:49 - 50:54)
Pokemon but we're going to have our Rock (50:52 - 50:58)
Pokemon or bat Pokemon are that's right (50:54 - 51:01)
Bird and Ernie sock and throw (50:58 - 51:01)
Pokemon yeah the question is do they (51:03 - 51:06)
have Pikachu because it weren't in black (51:04 - 51:09)
and white but would they be would they (51:06 - 51:11)
be in because the Pikachu's and (51:09 - 51:12)
everything in go right they would have (51:11 - 51:15)
Pikachu wearing a mulga outfit there you (51:12 - 51:17)
go oh that would be awesome I'd be so (51:15 - 51:19)
down for that (51:17 - 51:22)
yeah what hat would be Pikachu wearing (51:19 - 51:24)
just the wings the other oh you know the (51:22 - 51:26)
other thing we didn't talk about is how (51:24 - 51:28)
they like (51:26 - 51:31)
cycled the time so 30 minutes were like (51:28 - 51:33)
CNO and then the next 30 minutes were (51:31 - 51:36)
like Hui and I thought they did that (51:33 - 51:38)
really well (51:36 - 51:41)
um and it (51:38 - 51:43)
felt in between like cycling every 30 (51:41 - 51:46)
minutes and then the raids of like Diago (51:43 - 51:48)
Pia for the first 30 and then the horses (51:46 - 51:50)
that's what we called them for I mean (51:48 - 51:54)
they are justo pakia again for the the (51:50 - 51:56)
the next 30 felt like like there was (51:54 - 51:59)
always something to do and like even if (51:56 - 52:03)
you stayed in like the mountain Hot (51:59 - 52:06)
Springs um the spawns would change over (52:03 - 52:09)
every 30 minutes whether they were like (52:06 - 52:10)
koui or not (52:09 - 52:13)
so that was that was cool that kind of (52:10 - 52:17)
felt like the bio the the SpaceTime (52:13 - 52:21)
distortions in Legends (52:17 - 52:24)
archus except they just flipped the (52:21 - 52:26)
whole map for 30 minutes (52:24 - 52:29)
yeah I think it also it works really (52:26 - 52:31)
well because one of the things that (52:29 - 52:33)
we've talked about about previous events (52:31 - 52:36)
is making sure that people take care of (52:33 - 52:38)
themselves right because it's not (52:36 - 52:41)
unusual that people will just forget all (52:38 - 52:43)
about lunch right and I think that the (52:41 - 52:46)
advantage of the way they did it in both (52:43 - 52:48)
it's the same things throughout the day (52:46 - 52:50)
just split up into half hour sections (52:48 - 52:52)
rather than you know if we look at (52:50 - 52:55)
Global this weekend it's like this hour (52:52 - 52:56)
is different from that error is (52:55 - 52:58)
different from that error so you you (52:56 - 52:59)
feel like you have to be playing (52:58 - 53:00)
everything because you're going to miss (52:59 - 53:02)
something and sure it repeats itself but (53:00 - 53:06)
it repeats itself once um the advantage (53:02 - 53:09)
of it being the same each hour just each (53:06 - 53:12)
hour is split into half and also the (53:09 - 53:14)
fact that I think it was probably pretty (53:12 - 53:16)
common for people to be kind of focused (53:14 - 53:18)
more on one half hour than the other it (53:16 - 53:20)
allows you to have that breather between (53:18 - 53:22)
the half hours so you're not constantly (53:20 - 53:25)
like oh there's always that you know or (53:22 - 53:27)
form raid that we need to get you're (53:25 - 53:30)
like okay here's this half an hour we'll (53:27 - 53:32)
go grab lunch now and we'll come back (53:30 - 53:34)
for more origin forms once they're back (53:32 - 53:34)
sort of (53:34 - 53:37)
thing they had that built in with with (53:34 - 53:39)
go Fest uh I know I can only speak to (53:37 - 53:41)
New York but I'm pretty sure they had it (53:39 - 53:43)
at the other go Fest too but there was (53:41 - 53:46)
like a transition period between uh your (53:43 - 53:48)
Park time and your city time or vice (53:46 - 53:50)
versa where they were encouraging you (53:48 - 53:52)
like hey there's nothing to do here for (53:50 - 53:54)
like an hour or whatever travel to where (53:52 - 53:56)
you're going to go play next maybe (53:54 - 53:58)
consider eating (53:56 - 54:00)
something and that was cool I think that (53:58 - 54:02)
that's very that's being very aware of (54:00 - 54:03)
your player base but you're right like (54:02 - 54:05)
if you're in a scenario like this where (54:03 - 54:09)
you're a block time from 9 to 5 like you (54:05 - 54:10)
know you're not gonna you're really not (54:09 - 54:12)
going to stop unless you're paying (54:10 - 54:13)
attention to the time like you said like (54:12 - 54:16)
every half hour oh it's it's at the 30 (54:13 - 54:19)
oh it's 11:30 I should probably think (54:16 - 54:21)
about a good point yeah I think that's a (54:19 - 54:23)
good point I think that that that would (54:21 - 54:24)
probably make people pay attention more (54:23 - 54:27)
to that yeah yeah I think the the other (54:24 - 54:29)
thing is this event would have probably (54:27 - 54:33)
been bad like I I'm I I will safe to say (54:29 - 54:36)
I really enjoyed this event (54:33 - 54:40)
like for me the the hotel and the flight (54:36 - 54:45)
and everything the the 50 to $70 Ubers (54:40 - 54:50)
that I I had to pay all felt worth it (54:45 - 54:53)
um but I think that feels worth it (54:50 - 54:56)
because they added the Hui Pokemon (54:53 - 54:58)
I think if they didn't have the Hui (54:56 - 55:03)
Pokemon it would have felt very (54:58 - 55:03)
Bland possibly I mean they would it's (55:03 - 55:08)
likely that they would have had (55:07 - 55:10)
something else to replace it right (55:08 - 55:11)
because we we know they don't have (55:10 - 55:13)
archus and they don't have manif and (55:11 - 55:16)
fion like I think if we if we're looking (55:13 - 55:20)
forward to like uh yova next year (55:16 - 55:22)
there's going to be something else or I (55:20 - 55:23)
mean unless you're you're not just (55:22 - 55:24)
talking about the Legends you're talking (55:23 - 55:26)
about all of the (55:24 - 55:28)
Pokemon I think I think if it was just (55:26 - 55:30)
Diga pakia that would have also felt bad (55:28 - 55:33)
I think having origin formed Diaga and (55:30 - 55:35)
Pia felt better I guess they could have (55:33 - 55:37)
like substituted that out for like the L (55:35 - 55:39)
spirits but I think the like Spirits (55:37 - 55:41)
appearing in the wild was like really (55:39 - 55:44)
nice and like a lot of fun (55:41 - 55:47)
um I don't like I understand why they (55:44 - 55:49)
did the reggies even though they're gen (55:47 - 55:50)
three Pokemon because you technically (55:49 - 55:53)
need them to get Reggie gigas they could (55:50 - 55:55)
have just put like Reggie gigas and eggs (55:53 - 55:56)
I think the only thing that would have (55:55 - 55:58)
made the event like close to perfect (55:56 - 56:00)
like I don't think archus needed to be (55:58 - 56:03)
there I think archus is a big enough (56:00 - 56:04)
Pokemon where you like save it for (56:03 - 56:07)
something special but I do think they (56:04 - 56:09)
maybe should have done like at the end (56:07 - 56:11)
of your quest line instead of just (56:09 - 56:14)
getting a bed which was funny I will (56:11 - 56:16)
give them that it was funny that like (56:14 - 56:17)
the final Pokemon at the end of the (56:16 - 56:19)
quest line was just Beed it should have (56:17 - 56:22)
been like here's a 100 kilometer (56:19 - 56:25)
incubator when you hatch this you get (56:22 - 56:25)
Mana (56:25 - 56:28)
or fion whichever I don't remember the (56:25 - 56:30)
order of how they appear I think it's (56:28 - 56:32)
manif you get manif first and then if (56:30 - 56:36)
you breed with manaf you get fion yeah (56:32 - 56:38)
um because I that's how they have to (56:36 - 56:40)
introduce that Pokemon right it has to (56:38 - 56:42)
be like a huge incubator that's like how (56:40 - 56:44)
else would this the whole premise of (56:42 - 56:46)
that Pokemon or you sort of like almost (56:44 - 56:49)
sterilize that whole experience and you (56:46 - 56:52)
just make it like a hatch 50 eggs task (56:49 - 56:54)
and one of those two things feels a lot (56:52 - 56:57)
better and I I think walking a huge egg (56:54 - 57:00)
is cool like much cooler than hatching (56:57 - 57:04)
50 eggs yeah yeah totally yeah but that (57:00 - 57:05)
this event definitely did run the risk (57:04 - 57:08)
of being pretty bland and I think (57:05 - 57:10)
Whoever thought of making it flipflop (57:08 - 57:12)
and having that Hui and tie in like that (57:10 - 57:14)
that really (57:12 - 57:17)
saved uh making the spawns interesting (57:14 - 57:19)
now granted there were some really (57:17 - 57:23)
awesome um Evolutions out in the wild (57:19 - 57:25)
like seeing a wild mag mortar or an (57:23 - 57:29)
electivire or an ursal Luna in the wild (57:25 - 57:32)
Ura was cool is pretty hyped but I think (57:29 - 57:34)
even if it was just that over time it (57:32 - 57:36)
would have gotten a little bit old so (57:34 - 57:40)
the Hui and flip-flop was awesome good (57:36 - 57:42)
touch (57:40 - 57:46)
yeah I thought the like in-person biomes (57:42 - 57:48)
were kind of like lacking like bubbling (57:46 - 57:50)
Meyer had this really cool poison (57:48 - 57:52)
volcano thing and it was probably one of (57:50 - 57:55)
their like nicest ever displays they had (57:52 - 57:58)
and then the ruins had the entangled (57:55 - 58:02)
ruins had like this Roman AR like just (57:58 - 58:04)
structure poles I don't know what they (58:02 - 58:07)
they were just like like an arch pillars (58:04 - 58:10)
arches yeah pillars yeah H hotring had (58:07 - 58:15)
nothing at all yeah they and the seaside (58:10 - 58:17)
Metropolis also had nothing you could (58:15 - 58:18)
argue that the stadium was in the middle (58:17 - 58:19)
of the (58:18 - 58:22)
seaside but that's kind of like a so (58:19 - 58:24)
someone described it as feeling like a (58:22 - 58:26)
group project (58:24 - 58:29)
where one person goes all out and then (58:26 - 58:31)
there's one person who well okay they (58:29 - 58:33)
pass and then the others are just kind (58:31 - 58:35)
of hanging on by their teeth at the edge (58:33 - 58:37)
of the group project they had those (58:35 - 58:39)
sweet foot bridges in Mountain hotring (58:37 - 58:41)
what are you talking about they did have (58:39 - 58:42)
Bridges that's true I can't believe they (58:41 - 58:44)
built whole Bridges just for this event (58:42 - 58:47)
that was (58:44 - 58:49)
nuts they should have filled the stadium (58:47 - 58:52)
with water for Seaside Metropolis like (58:49 - 58:54)
honestly that would have been cool it's (58:52 - 58:56)
it's it's weird cuz I I like like the (58:54 - 58:57)
stadium but I didn't really like the (58:56 - 58:59)
golf course like the golf course was (58:57 - 59:03)
like pretty lackluster to me it was fine (58:59 - 59:08)
um it's whatever like I kind of there (59:03 - 59:13)
were for it does it does make Vegas look (59:08 - 59:15)
like I don't know if the park dropped (59:13 - 59:18)
the ball or because they had that giant (59:15 - 59:20)
rock mountain in the middle uh that then (59:18 - 59:22)
they yelled at us for climbing on my (59:20 - 59:24)
reception was great up there I'll have (59:22 - 59:27)
you know (59:24 - 59:27)
but the cool thing in Vegas that they (59:29 - 59:35)
did which like kind of worked was when (59:31 - 59:37)
groud and Kyogre which one ever W won (59:35 - 59:40)
they like lit off like (59:37 - 59:43)
flares which was kind of cool like to be (59:40 - 59:45)
on like in the desert like covered in (59:43 - 59:47)
sand being like I still can't find this (59:45 - 59:49)
shiny nikata and then like look in the (59:47 - 59:51)
sky and there was like blue flares go up (59:49 - 59:53)
and then everyone would be like not (59:51 - 59:56)
Kyogre again we just want groud on but (59:53 - 60:00)
it was like the premise was kind of cool (59:56 - 60:01)
the fact that it was like very (60:00 - 60:03)
reminiscent of a gender reveal party was (60:01 - 60:06)
hilarious like Kyogre wants to go be (60:03 - 60:09)
like it's a boy like oh (60:06 - 60:13)
boy I did like that part the the other (60:09 - 60:14)
cool thing they did which I don't think (60:13 - 60:16)
a lot of trainers (60:14 - 60:19)
appreciate I feel like Niantic does do (60:16 - 60:22)
cool things but then like I feel like (60:19 - 60:25)
90% of the audience either just doesn't (60:22 - 60:26)
understand the cool thing they're doing (60:25 - 60:31)
or they don't care so in in Vegas they (60:26 - 60:33)
put like the reggi Rocks like in the (60:31 - 60:35)
desert and they were like supposed to (60:33 - 60:37)
like decode something and it was really (60:35 - 60:39)
cool if you understood that like the (60:37 - 60:42)
decoding of gen 3 and like the reggies (60:39 - 60:45)
it was so cool it was really clever and (60:42 - 60:50)
in in La they had a giant TV in in the (60:45 - 60:54)
ingled ruins sitting there (60:50 - 60:57)
and I like I said I don't think like 90% (60:54 - 60:58)
of people who were like staring at the (60:57 - 61:01)
TV like understood the reference or if (60:58 - 61:03)
they did they they maybe didn't care (61:01 - 61:05)
they just wanted the code from it but it (61:03 - 61:07)
was like part of the issue was it was (61:05 - 61:10)
bugged as well um so you were meant (61:07 - 61:13)
there was two there were two Rotom (61:10 - 61:15)
researches one of which was a code that (61:13 - 61:17)
was given online and the other one was (61:15 - 61:20)
the four stops with TVs that if you spun (61:17 - 61:22)
all four of them you got a second set of (61:20 - 61:25)
research but on the Saturday that wasn't (61:22 - 61:27)
working if you got the code first so of (61:25 - 61:29)
course we all knew the code was coming (61:27 - 61:30)
so the first thing we did was type in (61:29 - 61:32)
that code you got the r on research and (61:30 - 61:34)
then you spun the four stops and nothing (61:32 - 61:36)
happened so we spent ages just standing (61:34 - 61:38)
around the TVs going what are we meant (61:36 - 61:42)
to be doing with this was very (61:38 - 61:46)
confusing yeah I I it worked for me for (61:42 - 61:48)
the record I did get two you guys were (61:46 - 61:50)
all saying like oh I didn't get two for (61:48 - 61:52)
some I I got the two so it wasn't bugged (61:50 - 61:54)
for everyone but I think the TV was (61:52 - 61:57)
displaying the one that ended up online (61:54 - 61:58)
and then being there in person spinning (61:57 - 62:00)
the stops was supposed to get you the (61:58 - 62:03)
second one yeah but I think people got (62:00 - 62:05)
the first one and then were looking at (62:03 - 62:07)
the TV being like this is how I get my (62:05 - 62:09)
second one but I I didn't get it I just (62:07 - 62:10)
wanted to like get a good picture of the (62:09 - 62:12)
TV but I couldn't because so many people (62:10 - 62:14)
were crowded around the TV trying to (62:12 - 62:16)
figure out how to get their second row (62:14 - 62:19)
Time the TV also broke halfway through (62:16 - 62:21)
Saturday so people were just standing (62:19 - 62:22)
around it going it's not even working (62:21 - 62:25)
anymore and it was like on the ground it (62:22 - 62:27)
was like 3T tall I feel like if they put (62:25 - 62:29)
it like on a stage or something that (62:27 - 62:30)
would have been a little bit better yeah (62:29 - 62:33)
or like I don't know built like a little (62:30 - 62:35)
display around it and yeah like prop it (62:33 - 62:38)
up a little bit cuz like in Gen 4 when (62:35 - 62:41)
you go into the abandoned mansion in the (62:38 - 62:41)
the (62:41 - 62:43)
forest you're supposed to go like (62:41 - 62:45)
through multiple rooms and then the one (62:43 - 62:47)
room eventually has the TV and then you (62:45 - 62:49)
interact with the TV and then roton pops (62:47 - 62:53)
out um again very cool concept seeing a (62:49 - 62:55)
TV in the middle of a Golf Course was (62:53 - 62:58)
kind of cool and then it just like kind (62:55 - 63:00)
of flickering and then everyone's trying (62:58 - 63:02)
to figure out what's happening maybe not (63:00 - 63:05)
the best execution but like well and one (63:02 - 63:07)
of the TVs was was at the water station (63:05 - 63:11)
at the top um and it wasn't like filled (63:07 - 63:13)
out like the other one it wasn't in the (63:11 - 63:14)
kind of display that the other ones were (63:13 - 63:19)
it was just an LCD screen on the above (63:14 - 63:22)
some water taps and it was going and (63:19 - 63:24)
that's all it was I didn't see that one (63:22 - 63:26)
I didn't either it was that's because (63:24 - 63:28)
you wouldn't not if you just looked it (63:26 - 63:29)
was right up at the top so you wouldn't (63:28 - 63:31)
go there unless you were getting the (63:29 - 63:33)
water cuz it was just it was a water (63:31 - 63:35)
station that happened to have a TV in it (63:33 - 63:37)
with the same thing on that the other (63:35 - 63:38)
ones (63:37 - 63:43)
had yeah I I don't know what the i i (63:38 - 63:44)
Whoever thought of the TV thing or the (63:43 - 63:47)
regir rock thing like those whoever had (63:44 - 63:49)
dianic they deserve a raise like I (63:47 - 63:51)
appreciate the effort and the (63:49 - 63:53)
thoughtfulness execution on the other (63:51 - 63:57)
hand could be better on Sunday I believe (63:53 - 64:00)
they had people there standing there on (63:57 - 64:03)
staff like explaining it uh because I (64:00 - 64:06)
walked past the one in entangled ruins a (64:03 - 64:07)
handful of times and there was a staff (64:06 - 64:09)
member just talking about it next to the (64:07 - 64:11)
TV now I don't know if that's because it (64:09 - 64:13)
might have still been broken or not or (64:11 - 64:14)
if they were like some people need some (64:13 - 64:16)
help making connections here about what (64:14 - 64:18)
this is but either way I think they they (64:16 - 64:21)
changed tactics on (64:18 - 64:24)
Sunday um yeah they did break they did (64:21 - 64:26)
have cows cellular on Wheels they had (64:24 - 64:29)
the T-Mobile the Verizon the (64:26 - 64:32)
AT&T they had two T-Mobile ones oh did (64:29 - 64:36)
they the the two the two the the tech (64:32 - 64:40)
support Booth surprisingly empty I'm (64:36 - 64:41)
sure there's somebody listening to the (64:40 - 64:43)
podcast that were like I had issues I'm (64:41 - 64:45)
I'm sure there were a few issues but (64:43 - 64:49)
compared to a lot of events the there (64:45 - 64:51)
was no line of TCH support which is only (64:49 - 64:53)
a good thing there were more there were (64:51 - 64:55)
they definitely overstaffed the tech (64:53 - 64:56)
support (64:55 - 64:59)
tent for once I don't think they needed (64:56 - 65:02)
to that's the way you want it though you (64:59 - 65:04)
definitely want to overstaffed and (65:02 - 65:05)
understaffed yeah you know that there (65:04 - 65:07)
was somebody on that team that was at (65:05 - 65:09)
Vegas last year and before the the gates (65:07 - 65:11)
opened on Saturday they're like look (65:09 - 65:12)
this is what you can expect and then (65:11 - 65:14)
throughout the day they're like wait a (65:12 - 65:16)
minute this is wonderful everything's (65:14 - 65:19)
working great it's interesting though (65:16 - 65:22)
like in Vegas they literally put routers (65:19 - 65:25)
onto TVs and they like hung the wires (65:22 - 65:27)
and they they then there was none of (65:25 - 65:29)
that here I wonder I always curious of (65:27 - 65:31)
what their decision of like we're going (65:29 - 65:34)
to build a Wi-Fi network in this park (65:31 - 65:37)
versus we're just going to get more cows (65:34 - 65:39)
to come out (65:37 - 65:42)
here may maybe that Park was just such a (65:39 - 65:45)
dead zone that yeah could also be like (65:42 - 65:51)
was the one in Vegas was it closer to (65:45 - 65:54)
civilization no it was like like the (65:51 - 65:58)
airport broke downtown Vegas Airport (65:54 - 66:01)
then the park so it maybe air maybe they (65:58 - 66:02)
couldn't bring cows cuz the airport I (66:01 - 66:05)
don't think that's how it works I also (66:02 - 66:06)
think it's it's because like the park in (66:05 - 66:09)
Vegas was a public park but the golf (66:06 - 66:12)
course is like a luxury private location (66:09 - 66:14)
so they probably have more amenities (66:12 - 66:16)
strung throughout for for service like (66:14 - 66:18)
that because if you're like you know a (66:16 - 66:19)
CEO of some company doing a round of (66:18 - 66:21)
golf and you can't answer phone calls (66:19 - 66:23)
like that's that's a complaint that (66:21 - 66:28)
person is probably in right right (66:23 - 66:28)
yeah uh yeah I I liked this event it (66:29 - 66:38)
makes me excited for what a Gen 5 tour (66:33 - 66:41)
would be like it just the big question (66:38 - 66:43)
is you have a new you have a New York (66:41 - 66:46)
based thing and it's been February every (66:43 - 66:50)
year um so it's just February in New (66:46 - 66:52)
York doesn't (66:50 - 66:58)
work so you NOA like Texas doesn't feel (66:52 - 67:01)
well maybe it does if you're like (66:58 - 67:05)
clay clay and palone uh yeah that that (67:01 - 67:07)
feels a little weird but then you know (67:05 - 67:08)
when I'm thinking about like the spirit (67:07 - 67:11)
tomb stuff and the Spinda stuff and the (67:08 - 67:14)
Kyogre flares and the (67:11 - 67:19)
um the SpaceTime Distortion that made (67:14 - 67:21)
these last two events pretty unique and (67:19 - 67:23)
pretty different I do wonder what the (67:21 - 67:27)
unique thing of Unova would be they (67:23 - 67:28)
could just go back to the Kanto jotto (67:27 - 67:29)
thing which is like fill out your (67:28 - 67:31)
Pokedex which I think is cool and I (67:29 - 67:34)
think is novel um but I don't (67:31 - 67:38)
think I don't think is as interesting (67:34 - 67:39)
like I think they should still have it (67:38 - 67:40)
for sure I I did (67:39 - 67:44)
enjoy clearing the Pokedex but I would (67:40 - 67:46)
assume by Unova tour we would have black (67:44 - 67:48)
kierum and white kierum but I don't also (67:46 - 67:50)
know how interesting that would be (67:48 - 67:52)
unless they have their own adventure (67:50 - 67:53)
effects which we didn't talk about the (67:52 - 67:55)
adventure effect effects are dope (67:53 - 67:58)
they're so cool yeah I do think they're (67:55 - 68:01)
cool uh I think for most people they're (67:58 - 68:04)
probably too expensive I think (68:01 - 68:08)
for you know hardcore players you're (68:04 - 68:09)
going to get a lot of candy and we did (68:08 - 68:11)
get a lot of candy raing them or the (68:09 - 68:14)
weekend um but it's not like we're going (68:11 - 68:17)
to be able to regularly get a lot of (68:14 - 68:22)
Diga and palia Candy um I do wish it (68:17 - 68:24)
worked a little bit like megas where (68:22 - 68:27)
every week you could do it once for free (68:24 - 68:30)
I think that would be a nice change to (68:27 - 68:32)
it I think that would eventually come (68:30 - 68:35)
right hopefully just like how a lot of (68:32 - 68:36)
things were pretty restricted and then (68:35 - 68:38)
they loosen up like zygar is like really (68:36 - 68:40)
hard to get right now but like (68:38 - 68:42)
eventually we all know that the hand (68:40 - 68:44)
we'll have too many zards at some point (68:42 - 68:47)
fingers crossed yeah uh and yeah I would (68:44 - 68:49)
I would want them to do more more of (68:47 - 68:51)
that sort of thing uh I think it makes (68:49 - 68:53)
sense to do thematically ones don't add (68:51 - 68:55)
up to everyone every Pokemon but I think (68:53 - 68:57)
if they can think of cool things (68:55 - 69:00)
for uh white and black curum I think (68:57 - 69:02)
that would be a really really nice (69:00 - 69:04)
thing visually they look really really (69:02 - 69:07)
cool I think spatial Ren looks awesome (69:04 - 69:10)
in game they did a great job with (69:07 - 69:15)
that I have H seven and 701 palia (69:10 - 69:18)
candy and three million Stardust so I (69:15 - 69:20)
think I can hit the button pretty much (69:18 - 69:22)
whenever I (69:20 - 69:25)
want but I also have (69:22 - 69:28)
1,500 rare candy so I can just turn (69:25 - 69:33)
those into Diaga and Pia 900 900 Diaga (69:28 - 69:35)
candy the other the other thing we (69:33 - 69:37)
haven't talked about is (69:35 - 69:39)
basculin on Ro yeah I totally forgot to (69:37 - 69:40)
do (69:39 - 69:44)
basculin I didn't do it at once yeah so (69:40 - 69:46)
I think part of the problem with it is (69:44 - 69:48)
that they didn't have any routs in the (69:46 - 69:52)
stadium uh so you couldn't do it on your (69:48 - 69:55)
day uh in in the stadium because it was (69:52 - 70:00)
only during event errors as well um (69:55 - 70:03)
uh playing in downtown pasadina meant (70:00 - 70:04)
there was no way I was going to forget (70:03 - 70:06)
because half the people were shouting (70:04 - 70:09)
basculin all the time um I did like gosh (70:06 - 70:10)
I didn't I didn't get that experience I (70:09 - 70:12)
wish I did it was it was it was pretty (70:10 - 70:15)
fun it was pretty fun I I will say the (70:12 - 70:18)
spawns were very good in the if you did (70:15 - 70:21)
a route you know kind of your usual 10 (70:18 - 70:24)
15 minute walk route you would get four (70:21 - 70:28)
to five maybe six basculin so I you (70:24 - 70:30)
realistically only needed to do one (70:28 - 70:32)
route to get as many as you wanted (70:30 - 70:35)
unless you got really bad spawns for the (70:32 - 70:37)
genders in which case she did a second (70:35 - 70:41)
one so I think that was really well done (70:37 - 70:44)
um there was shiny release too right (70:41 - 70:47)
there was yeah yeah there was am I crazy (70:44 - 70:49)
did they not come out and say that Basin (70:47 - 70:51)
wasn't going to be shiny I couldn't (70:49 - 70:53)
remember them saying it at all that's (70:51 - 70:55)
why I was so surprised surprised by it (70:53 - 70:56)
and then the shiny is like essentially (70:55 - 70:58)
the same color too so like some (70:56 - 70:59)
screenshots really didn't do any justice (70:58 - 71:02)
anyway yeah it's slightly darker but (70:59 - 71:06)
very slightly um yeah but basal Legion (71:02 - 71:08)
isn't even an option yet either so this (71:06 - 71:10)
is just like (71:08 - 71:12)
preparation and we don't know I guess (71:10 - 71:14)
the question is I don't think we know (71:12 - 71:16)
whether we'll be able to evolve the (71:14 - 71:19)
basculin or not well this is like the (71:16 - 71:20)
this is the Stantler weirder issue cuz (71:19 - 71:22)
St any Stantler can evolve into Weir (71:20 - 71:24)
deer and like (71:22 - 71:28)
any but not but only White Strip basalin (71:24 - 71:33)
can evolve into basal Legion (71:28 - 71:33)
so like I don't it's a real all squares (71:34 - 71:41)
are rectangles situation yeah not (71:38 - 71:43)
rectangles were squares yeah I don't (71:41 - 71:46)
know and I didn't even get to do a route (71:43 - 71:47)
I had a couple of friends trade me like (71:46 - 71:48)
two of them because I was in the park (71:47 - 71:53)
both days right um but my my bet is 100% (71:48 - 71:55)
that that's going to be in raids and (71:53 - 71:59)
maybe they let us evolve them later okay (71:55 - 72:01)
so I've checked on the on the website uh (71:59 - 72:03)
it doesn't say anything about shiny yes (72:01 - 72:06)
or no it says uh a new encounter on (72:03 - 72:08)
Roots white striped masculine will (72:06 - 72:11)
appear on rots during Pokemon go to CNO (72:08 - 72:14)
Los Angeles and then it says White Strip (72:11 - 72:16)
masculine cannot currently evolve in (72:14 - 72:20)
Pokemon go currently being quite a a (72:16 - 72:21)
heavy word there that impes it will be (72:20 - 72:24)
able to doesn't mean they won't do raids (72:21 - 72:26)
first I could see them doing raids and (72:24 - 72:27)
then (72:26 - 72:29)
Unlocking The (72:27 - 72:31)
Evolution because they got to get that (72:29 - 72:34)
raid money first but I don't it sounds (72:31 - 72:35)
like they're going to enable it to (72:34 - 72:39)
evolve at some point surely there was a (72:35 - 72:43)
an official Niantic route in Pasadena (72:39 - 72:44)
that when you clicked on it it was like (72:43 - 72:46)
official Niantic made this uh I wish I (72:44 - 72:47)
would have done that I don't know if you (72:46 - 72:51)
did it Al I didn't I I know tone did it (72:47 - 72:53)
uh while I was walking in cuz my hotel (72:51 - 72:56)
was was like an hour's walk from (72:53 - 72:58)
downtown Pasadena so I was walking in (72:56 - 72:59)
and ton did it while I was there and (72:58 - 73:02)
then we did some other stuff so but yeah (72:59 - 73:05)
t tone said that that um he enjoyed (73:02 - 73:08)
doing that so it was good fun I'm and (73:05 - 73:10)
I'm pretty sure there there was no (73:08 - 73:14)
routes or anything for Osaka go Fest but (73:10 - 73:17)
there was an official route outside of (73:14 - 73:19)
yokahama in (73:17 - 73:21)
Worlds (73:19 - 73:24)
um for whatever that was like worth I (73:21 - 73:25)
literally still have a route pending (73:24 - 73:27)
from Japan that I I made from like the (73:25 - 73:30)
train station to like the cat Shrine (73:27 - 73:32)
it's like a 15minute walk it's like the (73:30 - 73:34)
walk you would have taken when you get (73:32 - 73:37)
off like you go to that train station to (73:34 - 73:38)
then walk to the Catrine that's why (73:37 - 73:40)
you're there so I made the route from (73:38 - 73:41)
the transation to the cat Shrine still (73:40 - 73:45)
pending still still waiting for (73:41 - 73:47)
approval yeah I believe that there were (73:45 - 73:51)
Niantic uh routes in New York as well so (73:47 - 73:52)
I think that they're getting in the (73:51 - 73:54)
habit of doing that which is nice nice (73:52 - 73:57)
that's very very cool um but at the same (73:54 - 73:59)
time like may it kind of takes away from (73:57 - 74:01)
the spotlight of like part of the (73:59 - 74:02)
motivation of making a route that's good (74:01 - 74:05)
and that people like is that you get you (74:02 - 74:07)
get kind of get recognized for it in app (74:05 - 74:10)
like it shows you who made it um so I (74:07 - 74:11)
guess it kind of takes a little bit away (74:10 - 74:12)
from that but at the same time like an (74:11 - 74:15)
official route has a spot too in my head (74:12 - 74:17)
like and that's neat it'd be cool if it (74:15 - 74:19)
gave you something extra for it it was (74:17 - 74:21)
like oh hey during this event here's an (74:19 - 74:23)
official route and you know you get a (74:21 - 74:25)
rare in addition to your regular rewards (74:23 - 74:27)
for doing it or something or even (74:25 - 74:29)
something like the the good thing about (74:27 - 74:32)
kind of the the temporary gyms at these (74:29 - 74:34)
events is you get your badges from them (74:32 - 74:36)
and the stops you get your gifts from (74:34 - 74:38)
them so with both of them you can have (74:36 - 74:40)
something permanently that remind you of (74:38 - 74:42)
that whereas with the (74:40 - 74:44)
root okay you might get a zygard cell (74:42 - 74:47)
and you'll get some basculin but those (74:44 - 74:49)
don't make it clear I mean I guess (74:47 - 74:52)
basculin you catch will say during the (74:49 - 74:54)
event so that that's probably the (74:52 - 74:56)
closest you get to a (74:54 - 74:59)
permanent reminder of that particular (74:56 - 75:00)
thing but yeah it would be nice to have (74:59 - 75:03)
an equivalent of a medal or or a badge (75:00 - 75:08)
sorry or a h gift from (75:03 - 75:11)
AO yeah we we mentioned earlier that (75:08 - 75:12)
like the adventure effects for like (75:11 - 75:15)
pakia and Diaga are like more for a (75:12 - 75:17)
hardcore player that like does a lot of (75:15 - 75:20)
candy has lost artist which I I think is (75:17 - 75:24)
fine I think like Niantic does need to (75:20 - 75:27)
somewhat cater to hardcore players in (75:24 - 75:29)
any ways although there is like there is (75:27 - 75:31)
like a (75:29 - 75:36)
slight lower barrier I guess like with (75:31 - 75:39)
with um Primal Kyogre and Primal Groudon (75:36 - 75:42)
not only do you need like ideally you (75:39 - 75:45)
want Omega like a good Primal but you (75:42 - 75:47)
also need the energy but then you also (75:45 - 75:49)
have to do it like 45 times to like Max (75:47 - 75:51)
it out and like you still need the cyon (75:49 - 75:53)
stardus to power it up with thega and (75:51 - 75:56)
palia you just need to have one with the (75:53 - 75:58)
move and you never have to power it up (75:56 - 75:59)
you never have to invest with it doesn't (75:58 - 76:01)
matter if it's shiny or not doesn't (75:59 - 76:03)
matter which one you click on like you (76:01 - 76:06)
can just click the button and it works (76:03 - 76:07)
it's almost like at a certain point they (76:06 - 76:09)
should just move the button outside of (76:07 - 76:13)
the Pokemon spawn because like wasn't (76:09 - 76:15)
matter at that point because you just (76:13 - 76:16)
like it was really nice to just go like (76:15 - 76:17)
oh I'm just going to click my recent one (76:16 - 76:20)
and hit the spatial Rend and then it's (76:17 - 76:22)
going to work on the flip side though of (76:20 - 76:24)
like that being like a more hardcore (76:22 - 76:27)
feature Niantic wanted people to Party (76:24 - 76:30)
play for this event for like I think (76:27 - 76:31)
like three (76:30 - 76:35)
missions um yeah to I don't even I think (76:31 - 76:38)
was that the Reggie stuff to party yes (76:35 - 76:41)
yes uh and the regular reggies not the (76:38 - 76:44)
shadow ones yeah and I feel (76:41 - 76:47)
like people like Party play they just (76:44 - 76:50)
needed to do it they just needed to like (76:47 - 76:52)
get into a party and like have tasks (76:50 - 76:54)
that Mak sense sense doing and like (76:52 - 76:57)
getting like decent rewards but like I (76:54 - 76:59)
felt like everyone at Disney that we (76:57 - 77:01)
hung out with we were just like making (76:59 - 77:03)
sure everyone was in a party when we (77:01 - 77:07)
were in the park it was like great I so (77:03 - 77:09)
yeah so I think part of the reason we (77:07 - 77:11)
were so focused on making sure that we (77:09 - 77:13)
were always in a party was because we (77:11 - 77:16)
all needed to get that research done uh (77:13 - 77:18)
and we didn't but you know most of us (77:16 - 77:22)
were about halfway there now uh I don't (77:18 - 77:24)
think I've ever thought I would enjoy (77:22 - 77:27)
Party play my problem is the effort to (77:24 - 77:29)
go the same reason that I don't inperson (77:27 - 77:32)
raid very much is because you have to (77:29 - 77:34)
coordinate with people and you have to (77:32 - 77:36)
find that time and you have to actually (77:34 - 77:37)
physically meet up with (77:36 - 77:41)
people and that's fine like I'm not (77:37 - 77:43)
saying that's a problem I think it's a (77:41 - 77:45)
the good thing about it is that it is (77:43 - 77:47)
giving you more benefits to doing that (77:45 - 77:49)
which is what we had asked nanting to do (77:47 - 77:51)
for so long is stop taking away things (77:49 - 77:54)
if you're not doing in person and (77:51 - 77:56)
instead Give us new stuff and that is (77:54 - 77:59)
that the problem is just I rarely get in (77:56 - 78:01)
the situation where I'm going to do that (77:59 - 78:03)
and it was it was good fun it was (78:01 - 78:05)
enjoyable to do but it's not it's still (78:03 - 78:06)
not something I'm going to be doing (78:05 - 78:08)
regularly because I just don't have the (78:06 - 78:10)
time to organize to go out and play (78:08 - 78:11)
people and I'm not saying that that's (78:10 - 78:14)
niantic's fault it's just that that is (78:11 - 78:16)
just fact how dare Niantic now think of (78:14 - 78:19)
your schedule how dare they give me kids (78:16 - 78:21)
and give me a job and all these things (78:19 - 78:24)
that take up my time (78:21 - 78:26)
I will say my favorite aspect of party (78:24 - 78:28)
play and this was really highlighted (78:26 - 78:30)
here was that um because people were (78:28 - 78:31)
doing raids non-stop if you really (78:30 - 78:34)
wanted to if your party leader was in a (78:31 - 78:37)
raid and then your task rolled over (78:34 - 78:38)
you'd have to wait for that person to be (78:37 - 78:40)
done with the raid in order to pick like (78:38 - 78:43)
the next challenge right or task so that (78:40 - 78:46)
I was gifted the opportunity of giving (78:43 - 78:48)
that person grief every time and for (78:46 - 78:50)
that I'm very thankful because it was (78:48 - 78:53)
funny the I will say the other really (78:50 - 78:54)
good thing about using it at an event (78:53 - 78:56)
like that uh and this is particularly (78:54 - 78:58)
advised to people who are going to go to (78:56 - 78:59)
who didn't go to this event and and will (78:58 - 79:01)
be going to a future one is party plays (78:59 - 79:02)
really great for meeting up after you've (79:01 - 79:05)
gone to the toilet like because you you (79:02 - 79:07)
see each other on the map and the event (79:05 - 79:09)
isn't big enough for it to disconnect (79:07 - 79:11)
and so you go off to the toilet and then (79:09 - 79:14)
you finish and you get your phone after (79:11 - 79:15)
you've washed your hands and you're like (79:14 - 79:17)
where are they and then you just start (79:15 - 79:18)
walking towards them you can see where (79:17 - 79:20)
they are you can see where they're (79:18 - 79:21)
moving and they can see you come you (79:20 - 79:23)
don't need to communicate it's was (79:21 - 79:25)
fantastic to be able to get your way (79:23 - 79:26)
back to (79:25 - 79:29)
people that and this one didn't have a a (79:26 - 79:31)
time limit I I could have sworn it was (79:29 - 79:34)
eight hours eight hourss eight hours (79:31 - 79:36)
yeah okay yeah that that was great that (79:34 - 79:39)
was a huge game Cher for me like being (79:36 - 79:41)
like Oh yeah we're still in a party oh (79:39 - 79:42)
we're still working on this one that (79:41 - 79:43)
we're taking a little bit longer on but (79:42 - 79:44)
I don't have to worry about it because (79:43 - 79:46)
we've been in this party for three hours (79:44 - 79:49)
is this a bug no I do think that they (79:46 - 79:51)
should they should just do that all the (79:49 - 79:54)
time I don't I don't understand the 1 (79:51 - 79:56)
hour time limit because especially the (79:54 - 79:57)
the funny thing was they removed the 8 (79:56 - 80:00)
hours after outside of the normal hours (79:57 - 80:02)
so when we were at Disney it was 1 hour (80:00 - 80:04)
but it was still saying eight hours so (80:02 - 80:06)
our our party closed after an hour and (80:04 - 80:09)
it said oh your party has closed because (80:06 - 80:11)
it only lasts eight hours and we're like (80:09 - 80:13)
but we only just started it an hour ago (80:11 - 80:16)
yeah it was very SpaceTime distortions (80:13 - 80:19)
SpaceTime distortions I I am curious of (80:16 - 80:21)
like people who went to the event solo (80:19 - 80:24)
like there are a lot of like solo (80:21 - 80:26)
Pokemon go players who then were like (80:24 - 80:30)
put in a position to ask somebody to do (80:26 - 80:32)
Party play because you needed to do I it (80:30 - 80:33)
was pretty I mean like once you were in (80:32 - 80:35)
a party it probably took like 10 minutes (80:33 - 80:37)
to like run through three tasks to (80:35 - 80:40)
finish it um unless you had (80:37 - 80:45)
like get now even like the like get six (80:40 - 80:46)
steel Pokemon were relatively easy if (80:45 - 80:49)
you just I was difficult the ice one was (80:46 - 80:51)
difficult yeah no the ice one you were (80:49 - 80:53)
supposed to catch the the snow just no (80:51 - 80:55)
one wanted to be in the hot springs cuz (80:53 - 80:57)
it was (80:55 - 81:00)
bad also why is snow in Hot Springs he's (80:57 - 81:02)
ice Pokemon it doesn't make any sense (81:00 - 81:05)
cuz it's a mountain hot spring he like (81:02 - 81:06)
they could have they could have helped (81:05 - 81:09)
that I think by at the the trainer tent (81:06 - 81:11)
I think because quite often they have (81:09 - 81:12)
like here's an area where you can go to (81:11 - 81:14)
trade and stuff like that they could (81:12 - 81:18)
have had a come here to get a party um (81:14 - 81:21)
and it would have removed that social to (81:18 - 81:23)
find somebody cuz you just go and this (81:21 - 81:25)
is the area and you go oh great you're (81:23 - 81:27)
looking for a party too that's fine you (81:25 - 81:28)
know that the people there are going to (81:27 - 81:29)
want that I think that would that would (81:28 - 81:30)
be a really good thing for them to do in (81:29 - 81:32)
the (81:30 - 81:34)
future yeah did they did they have a (81:32 - 81:36)
designated trade area I know they were (81:34 - 81:39)
handing out the pallets I don't signs I (81:36 - 81:41)
didn't really go to that the tent (81:39 - 81:43)
because it was very busy and they for (81:41 - 81:45)
some reason were doing trivia there at (81:43 - 81:45)
the same (81:45 - 81:48)
time which meant that you didn't really (81:45 - 81:50)
want to go to that area to find that (81:48 - 81:52)
stuff out I think it definitely (81:50 - 81:54)
encouraged cting cuz people were sitting (81:52 - 81:56)
down and taking a load off and and just (81:54 - 81:57)
congregating there and everybody had (81:56 - 82:00)
their paddles out um but yeah there (81:57 - 82:01)
wasn't like there there wasn't a (82:00 - 82:02)
designated trade area and then I don't (82:01 - 82:04)
think there was a designated battle area (82:02 - 82:07)
either that's kind of a go Fest sort of (82:04 - 82:09)
thing okay um but I guess that sort of (82:07 - 82:11)
begs the question like aren aren't these (82:09 - 82:13)
events getting pretty similar to goof (82:11 - 82:16)
Fest at this point like identity wise I (82:13 - 82:18)
mean it used to be for Kanto and jotto (82:16 - 82:20)
you know the collection of the entire (82:18 - 82:22)
pokeddex that was very unique to tour (82:20 - 82:26)
but like th this was really close to (82:22 - 82:29)
feeling like a go Fest really close yeah (82:26 - 82:31)
it was I called it I I I continue to (82:29 - 82:33)
call it Go Fest on accident just because (82:31 - 82:36)
it was like yeah it's just yeah go (82:33 - 82:38)
Festival yeah I mean is that is that a (82:36 - 82:41)
problem I don't think so but but I mean (82:38 - 82:43)
like if you if you were to ask me what's (82:41 - 82:45)
the difference between the two I I (82:43 - 82:48)
wouldn't really have a a robust good (82:45 - 82:50)
answer for you anymore for me the (82:48 - 82:52)
difference is when it is right like it's (82:50 - 82:54)
really different ult for me to (82:52 - 82:56)
organize going to a different country in (82:54 - 83:00)
the summer right not least because I (82:56 - 83:02)
have a family the summer is generally (83:00 - 83:04)
when they're out of school so that makes (83:02 - 83:06)
it more difficult like there's lots of (83:04 - 83:09)
things also it makes it more expensive (83:06 - 83:10)
generally going places it was cheaper (83:09 - 83:15)
for me to fly to La now than it was for (83:10 - 83:18)
I looked at flights for New York last (83:15 - 83:20)
year that was more expensive than flying (83:18 - 83:23)
to La which is like double the flight (83:20 - 83:25)
distance (83:23 - 83:28)
mhm (83:25 - 83:31)
like I I guess maybe like even even (83:28 - 83:35)
shiny wise the event felt very similar (83:31 - 83:36)
to go (83:35 - 83:39)
Fest like I I in the in the three days I (83:36 - 83:43)
got like 75 shinies and I I didn't I (83:39 - 83:45)
didn't even play this sorry I'm not like (83:43 - 83:46)
trying to break I didn't like play the (83:45 - 83:48)
entire time like I just explained on (83:46 - 83:51)
Friday I was in the car for almost 4 (83:48 - 83:54)
hours of the event (83:51 - 83:56)
because like it took that long to get (83:54 - 83:58)
from Disney to whatever and that day I I (83:56 - 84:02)
think was 20 shinies and then in the (83:58 - 84:05)
park like I got to the park at 9ine and (84:02 - 84:06)
I skipped the line and everything cuz (84:05 - 84:09)
like whatever content creator passed now (84:06 - 84:11)
he's just showing off now yeah now I'm (84:09 - 84:13)
bring now I'm bragging but that like (84:11 - 84:15)
that first hour is just like talking to (84:13 - 84:17)
people like I was we were talking to (84:15 - 84:19)
Niantic and then they were like here's (84:17 - 84:20)
your like a lounge where you get like a (84:19 - 84:22)
free banana and a free water I was like (84:20 - 84:24)
cool I don't care about that where's the (84:22 - 84:26)
bathroom that's what I need it was a (84:24 - 84:27)
good banana for it was worth though by (84:26 - 84:30)
the way banana very fresh and then (84:27 - 84:32)
that's that's where like met up with (84:30 - 84:33)
Chris and everything we were talking (84:32 - 84:36)
like I didn't really start playing until (84:33 - 84:37)
like closer to (84:36 - 84:41)
11 um on that day yeah and then on on (84:37 - 84:44)
Sunday I did I did half the day in the (84:41 - 84:46)
park because I needed an nitic wanted to (84:44 - 84:47)
do like an interview that will probably (84:46 - 84:49)
like never get published because Niantic (84:47 - 84:50)
like records all this footage and then (84:49 - 84:53)
like uses like 1% of it for whatever a (84:50 - 84:54)
reason um I don't know if it's like (84:53 - 84:56)
sound issue or they changed their mind (84:54 - 84:58)
or whatever but like did the interview (84:56 - 85:00)
played played with Chris then I like (84:58 - 85:02)
left and (85:00 - 85:05)
then uh the group wanted to (85:02 - 85:08)
like go somewhere new so I we were going (85:05 - 85:10)
to go to Japan toown originally and I (85:08 - 85:11)
was like uh I had like really bad (85:10 - 85:13)
service in Japan toown last time but I (85:11 - 85:14)
think it's a good place to play so it's (85:13 - 85:16)
like well let's go to Chinatown so when (85:14 - 85:19)
we got to Chinatown we were like well (85:16 - 85:21)
well we didn't eat yet so let's like (85:19 - 85:23)
pick food and then there was like oh (85:21 - 85:24)
there's good food in Korea town so we (85:23 - 85:28)
went to Korea Town and we ate and then (85:24 - 85:30)
Korea Town was just not a good place to (85:28 - 85:32)
play compared to Japan Town which is (85:30 - 85:34)
like no one's fault but like you could (85:32 - 85:36)
just tell like when you're in like (85:34 - 85:38)
Pasadena or when you're in Santa Monica (85:36 - 85:39)
or when you're at Disney you could just (85:38 - 85:41)
tell that these are good places to play (85:39 - 85:42)
and there were people playing in Korea (85:41 - 85:45)
Town but like at a certain point it was (85:42 - 85:46)
like well do we get back in the car and (85:45 - 85:48)
drive like another 20 minutes it's like (85:46 - 85:50)
the like let's just finish playing here (85:48 - 85:54)
it's like fine like yeah um (85:50 - 85:54)
so like that's different than like the (85:56 - 86:02)
South Korea Safari Zone because I didn't (85:59 - 86:05)
feel like shinies were as boosted which (86:02 - 86:08)
is not like good or bad but it did feel (86:05 - 86:11)
like the shiny boosted here was similar (86:08 - 86:13)
to go Fest which was also similar to (86:11 - 86:15)
like (86:13 - 86:19)
Vegas which didn't didn't feel the same (86:15 - 86:22)
as like Kanto or jotto tour but those (86:19 - 86:25)
weren't in iners events yeah that's (86:22 - 86:26)
important to remember that they didn't (86:25 - 86:29)
have that in-person uh portion with it (86:26 - 86:32)
but but again also like we said like (86:29 - 86:33)
three or four times now that difference (86:32 - 86:36)
of that collection challenge I feel like (86:33 - 86:39)
it's just so huge I I think I think that (86:36 - 86:41)
is the big thing right because they had (86:39 - 86:43)
what four collection challenges this (86:41 - 86:45)
time and each of them was four Pokemon (86:43 - 86:47)
like if you had a go plus plus and you (86:45 - 86:49)
were walking around 15 minutes in and (86:47 - 86:52)
you'd finished it right like it was (86:49 - 86:54)
really not like it was it wasn't a (86:52 - 86:57)
challenge it was an accident right right (86:54 - 87:00)
whereas the and obviously it's it as you (86:57 - 87:03)
mentioned it was different it wasn't in (87:00 - 87:05)
person it was also Co it was a weird (87:03 - 87:08)
time but the Canto one in particular it (87:05 - 87:09)
felt like a challenge it felt like it (87:08 - 87:12)
was actually difficult and but also I I (87:09 - 87:14)
think the advantage of that is it didn't (87:12 - 87:17)
feel like I'm missing out on a lot if I (87:14 - 87:18)
don't finish this cu the whole point is (87:17 - 87:21)
it's a challenge it's a collect (87:18 - 87:22)
everything and if you don't get it okay (87:21 - 87:25)
there's a few rewards you miss and you (87:22 - 87:27)
don't get the medal but by this point in (87:25 - 87:28)
time I don't think anybody's like (87:27 - 87:30)
obsessively collecting the medals (87:28 - 87:33)
because it's so hard to do that I'm sure (87:30 - 87:35)
they I'm sure you're missing plenty (87:33 - 87:36)
right because you couldn't you couldn't (87:35 - 87:39)
be in New York and in Japan at the same (87:36 - 87:41)
time uh or was it Japan and London at (87:39 - 87:42)
the same time right Japan and London at (87:41 - 87:44)
the same time yeah so you can do and we (87:42 - 87:47)
got 12 collection medals over the (87:44 - 87:50)
weekend so the number is expanding quite (87:47 - 87:51)
a lot and if you miss one of those (87:50 - 87:54)
events that's quite a lot you can't get (87:51 - 87:57)
rest assured alot is killing me inside I (87:54 - 88:00)
missed out on like 24 I was actually so (87:57 - 88:01)
happy the first time they did an (88:00 - 88:03)
in-person one cuz I was like well I (88:01 - 88:06)
don't need to feel fomo anymore I'm free (88:03 - 88:08)
it's done right there's nothing I can do (88:06 - 88:10)
about this now I will never have all of (88:08 - 88:12)
them and that's (88:10 - 88:15)
okay like I I I know that going into (88:12 - 88:18)
this weekend with the world tour that (88:15 - 88:20)
the biggest complaint is like the (88:18 - 88:23)
shinies aren't as common (88:20 - 88:24)
or they didn't they didn't crank the (88:23 - 88:26)
shiny meter I'm sure it's going to be (88:24 - 88:29)
exactly the same as what do we we don't (88:26 - 88:30)
know that yet though do we are people (88:29 - 88:32)
just assuming that oh I'm assuming it's (88:30 - 88:35)
going to be the same as the hoen event (88:32 - 88:37)
last year where it was it was very (88:35 - 88:41)
obvious that the world shine EES was not (88:37 - 88:44)
as turned up as like inperson Vegas but (88:41 - 88:46)
this is like a debate every year of like (88:44 - 88:48)
this go Fest didn't feel as good as the (88:46 - 88:50)
last go Fest or we think Niantic Nerf (88:48 - 88:53)
shiny is this go Fest where like every (88:50 - 88:54)
time I've talked to Niantic after a go (88:53 - 88:56)
Fest they're like nope it's the same as (88:54 - 88:58)
last year we don't talk about shiny odds (88:56 - 89:00)
but like we didn't it's it's the same (88:58 - 89:02)
it's the same percentage or whatever (89:00 - 89:04)
like they're like we don't change it but (89:02 - 89:07)
they also didn't say (89:04 - 89:07)
like is the Vegas La the same as of go (89:07 - 89:15)
Fest or is it a little bit less or is it (89:13 - 89:17)
a little bit more and what is that (89:15 - 89:19)
compared to a safari zone is that a (89:17 - 89:20)
little bit less or that's a little bit (89:19 - 89:24)
more um because I I mean I've I've like (89:20 - 89:27)
this event I had 75 I remember (89:24 - 89:32)
the third go Fest which was in Chicago I (89:27 - 89:34)
went like the first four hours and got (89:32 - 89:35)
like one shiny and then somebody had the (89:34 - 89:37)
audacity to look at me and they're like (89:35 - 89:38)
why are you tapping and running away (89:37 - 89:40)
like yeah yes I know how to play this (89:38 - 89:44)
game do you know how RNG works I can see (89:40 - 89:47)
you getting so mad about (89:44 - 89:49)
that yeah I think it's important to (89:47 - 89:52)
remember that RNG has no loyalty right (89:49 - 89:56)
to anybody for sure um but like at the (89:52 - 89:58)
at the same time though you know game (89:56 - 90:00)
feel is an important thing to take into (89:58 - 90:03)
account right so um the conversation (90:00 - 90:05)
around it is fine I think it is just up (90:03 - 90:08)
to us as the consumer to uh you know (90:05 - 90:12)
really exercise our responsibility to (90:08 - 90:14)
keep our expectations in check and (90:12 - 90:15)
understand how the mechanics work (90:14 - 90:18)
instead of just inventing things to make (90:15 - 90:20)
us feel a little bit better and drag (90:18 - 90:22)
other people down right and that's just (90:20 - 90:24)
people on the internet man you (90:22 - 90:27)
know yeah like (90:24 - 90:29)
uh the tone who we were playing with (90:27 - 90:33)
they got four perfect Dio Pia I think (90:29 - 90:34)
they got two perfect Diga and two (90:33 - 90:37)
perfect Pia I didn't get any hundreds (90:34 - 90:40)
the entire weekend but also not a single (90:37 - 90:43)
one but also in that um they didn't get (90:40 - 90:47)
a single shiny diaa so it's like four (90:43 - 90:51)
perfect ones no shiny ones yeah and I (90:47 - 90:53)
have a bunch of shinies but literally no (90:51 - 90:56)
perfects like it it's whatever and I (90:53 - 90:58)
also I think I think it's important to (90:56 - 91:02)
say do not like there are cheaper ways (90:58 - 91:03)
to get (91:02 - 91:06)
shinies than going to an in-person go (91:03 - 91:09)
event right like yeah sure you can get a (91:06 - 91:11)
lot of shinies probably by going into (91:09 - 91:13)
the inperson event but that's very (91:11 - 91:16)
expensive and it's fun but if you go (91:13 - 91:18)
purely for shinies you might be (91:16 - 91:20)
disappointed but if you go for the (91:18 - 91:22)
experience and for the fun (91:20 - 91:25)
that you can't be disappointed then well (91:22 - 91:27)
you probably can but yeah sure sure sure (91:25 - 91:30)
sure you're unlikely to (91:27 - 91:34)
be yeah I had a good time at this event (91:30 - 91:36)
yeah yeah I mean even without comparing (91:34 - 91:38)
it to Vegas I think this was a stellar (91:36 - 91:41)
event it it was great yeah I mean the (91:38 - 91:43)
complaints are basically just it took a (91:41 - 91:45)
while to get in that's the main (91:43 - 91:47)
complaint that people had about the (91:45 - 91:50)
event and I think they more than made up (91:47 - 91:51)
for (91:50 - 91:52)
that (91:51 - 91:54)
yeah I think the (91:52 - 91:58)
extra I think adding on a Friday before (91:54 - 92:01)
was worth it and I think adding the (91:58 - 92:03)
option for the Sunday after was worth it (92:01 - 92:06)
and then it made the like oh we're going (92:03 - 92:07)
to be in the car for two and a half (92:06 - 92:11)
hours not feel like a panic attack like (92:07 - 92:13)
we have all weekend it's okay that we're (92:11 - 92:15)
in the car like we we got to go to (92:13 - 92:17)
Disney eventually we're just biting the (92:15 - 92:20)
bullet and going to Disney now yeah I (92:17 - 92:24)
think it feels I'm not a huge fan of the (92:20 - 92:25)
fact that you have to pay for the city (92:24 - 92:26)
experience (92:25 - 92:29)
personally um I think it feels a little (92:26 - 92:31)
bit money grabby to me it's like you've (92:29 - 92:33)
paid to get there you've paid for the (92:31 - 92:35)
event you've even maybe even paid for (92:33 - 92:39)
your your raid and your egg pass um but (92:35 - 92:41)
if you want to actually get more of the (92:39 - 92:43)
event while you're there you have it (92:41 - 92:46)
felt a little bit not great having said (92:43 - 92:49)
that I paid for both days because I (92:46 - 92:52)
wanted to experience that um and it's (92:49 - 92:54)
not a ridiculous amount of money Cons (92:52 - 92:56)
considering everything that I like it's (92:54 - 92:58)
basically a rounding error in what I (92:56 - 92:59)
what I paid for the weekend (92:58 - 93:02)
right but there's just something about (92:59 - 93:07)
it that rubs me the wrong way just in (93:02 - 93:09)
principle yeah I don't I don't really go (93:07 - 93:11)
to music festivals like outdoor music (93:09 - 93:12)
festivals and stuff but I know those (93:11 - 93:14)
tickets are pretty expensive and I like (93:12 - 93:16)
to people that don't play Pokemon go (93:14 - 93:18)
that I run into and they ask how these (93:16 - 93:21)
events are like I always compare them to (93:18 - 93:24)
like a laao or something like that right (93:21 - 93:26)
um where it's a lot of people outside (93:24 - 93:28)
sharing something that they enjoy and so (93:26 - 93:30)
I suppose the cost out of pocket if (93:28 - 93:31)
you're really going to pay for all of it (93:30 - 93:34)
is pretty similar by the end of the day (93:31 - 93:35)
um in order to attend those sorts of (93:34 - 93:37)
events but but yeah I think the nickel (93:35 - 93:40)
and diing and the like the like the line (93:37 - 93:41)
items for everything that you want to do (93:40 - 93:43)
like oh here's for hatching better (93:41 - 93:44)
here's for raiding better here's for (93:43 - 93:47)
another day like that just wears on you (93:44 - 93:52)
you know again it's another Optics thing (93:47 - 93:54)
yeah that's not new I suppose what we're (93:52 - 93:55)
talking wait until ntic starts charging (93:54 - 93:57)
for the premium bathrooms like those (93:55 - 94:01)
music festivals do oh gosh that's (93:57 - 94:03)
right charge a little bit more for the (94:01 - 94:07)
fancier bathroom yeah uh okay well I (94:03 - 94:09)
think that's our show um by the time (94:07 - 94:13)
this goes up on Monday the Pokemon day (94:09 - 94:16)
will be the next day (94:13 - 94:19)
uh if anything I feel like I uh this (94:16 - 94:22)
this program maybe compared to other (94:19 - 94:24)
programs out there have really set (94:22 - 94:27)
expectations in (94:24 - 94:27)
check I feel like some parts of the (94:27 - 94:31)
internet thinks that Pokemon day is (94:29 - 94:33)
about to announce like 14 brand new (94:31 - 94:36)

something comment whether you've gone to (95:17 - 95:22)
any of these events or if you would go (95:20 - 95:24)
to a future event or what it would take (95:22 - 95:27)
for you to go to an event that'd be cool (95:24 - 95:29)
