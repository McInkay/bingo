go Community day today and I probably am (0:31 - 0:35)
not going to go outside for it because (0:33 - 0:37)
the 3DS online shuts down and I have (0:35 - 0:40)
some things I need to finish up before (0:37 - 0:43)
then it is also repeat commun day that (0:40 - 0:48)
too uh Bobby also here hey I uh didn&#39;t (0:43 - 0:50)
sleep as well as I should have this week (0:48 - 0:53)
so uh Pokemon sleep not helping the way (0:50 - 0:55)
it&#39;s supposed (0:53 - 0:55)
to it&#39;s a game that inspires good Habs I (0:56 - 1:04)
am hoping that this will help me sleep (1:00 - 1:06)
and it is not doing it the way I thought (1:04 - 1:08)
it would that&#39;s okay though I still like (1:06 - 1:10)
okay we can&#39;t spend an hour on Pokemon (1:08 - 1:13)
sleep this (1:10 - 1:17)
week but this was the second week of REO (1:13 - 1:20)
so um well it sounds like Bobby you&#39;re (1:17 - 1:22)
still playing let&#39;s we&#39;ll talk about we (1:20 - 1:23)
we&#39;ll start with our normal Pokemon (1:22 - 1:25)
sleep we have some other Pokemon news (1:23 - 1:29)
not any crazy breaking news this week um (1:25 - 1:31)
but just just some new new stuff getting (1:29 - 1:34)
posted uh but B Bobby how was how was (1:31 - 1:37)
week two of raicho slwe three of you (1:34 - 1:38)
think you (1:37 - 1:41)
playing yeah so this is week three of me (1:38 - 1:44)
playing it was it&#39;s fine I the only (1:41 - 1:47)
thing is last night I fell asleep like (1:44 - 1:48)
on like like I fell asleep on the couch (1:47 - 1:50)
while I was watching a movie something (1:48 - 1:54)
and so I woke up and it was 5 o&#39;l in the (1:50 - 1:58)
morning and I was like oh no I didn&#39;t (1:54 - 2:01)
actually like do the thing before 4: (1:58 - 2:04)
a.m. so I guess now like when I did it (2:01 - 2:06)
was it recorded as like Sunday right and (2:04 - 2:08)
I didn&#39;t get anything recorded for (2:06 - 2:11)
Saturday so that was a bit of a bummer (2:08 - 2:13)
that you can&#39;t go back in because you (2:11 - 2:14)
can&#39;t go back in and like and say like (2:13 - 2:16)
well I actually fell asleep at this time (2:14 - 2:19)
to you can but it&#39;s just to record it (2:16 - 2:21)
right it doesn&#39;t actually like it (2:19 - 2:23)
wouldn&#39;t backtrack and be like oh well (2:21 - 2:24)
now you&#39;re getting (2:23 - 2:26)
Saturday I don&#39;t think it backtracks you (2:24 - 2:29)
can add sleep if you&#39;re on the premium (2:26 - 2:31)
but I don&#39;t think you can just it you (2:29 - 2:35)
cannot add sleep before a you cannot add (2:31 - 2:39)
sleep prior to a recorded sleep session (2:35 - 2:41)
it doesn&#39;t do that and they they did (2:39 - 2:44)
that because people were not me but (2:41 - 2:47)
other people were time traveling uhuh (2:44 - 2:49)
I&#39;m sure not me at (2:47 - 2:52)
all and Bobby you have yet to find out (2:49 - 2:54)
the real cost of that happening which is (2:52 - 2:57)
tomorrow you won&#39;t get a bonus (2:54 - 3:00)
biscuit right because I will go to sleep (2:57 - 3:03)
before 3:00 or four o&#39;clock hopefully (3:00 - 3:05)
and it will be that will be my second (3:03 - 3:07)
sleep of the day right and so then there (3:05 - 3:09)
won&#39;t be a bonus biscuit for that yep (3:07 - 3:11)
there won&#39;t be a bonus biscuit and you (3:09 - 3:14)
might mess up your (3:11 - 3:16)
energy consumption disappointing I am (3:14 - 3:19)
disappointed in this game now let me (3:16 - 3:24)
tell you cuz I did the same thing uh I I (3:19 - 3:28)
my tax guy messaged me and or no I (3:24 - 3:29)
messaged them cuz I was like oh I have a (3:28 - 3:32)
question before I submit my taxes to you (3:29 - 3:34)
and they were like here&#39;s the answer to (3:32 - 3:35)
that and I was like okay I should get it (3:34 - 3:37)
to you this weekend and they were like (3:35 - 3:39)
that&#39;s cutting it close and I was like (3:37 - 3:42)
fine I will drop everything I am doing I (3:39 - 3:43)
will get it done (3:42 - 3:46)
tonight uh which I for my tax guy I just (3:43 - 3:48)
have to like export all my but the the (3:46 - 3:50)
thing I have to do well he&#39;ll do it for (3:48 - 3:52)
me but he charges per hour so it&#39;s just (3:50 - 3:55)
way easier for me to do it is uh I have (3:52 - 3:57)
to just get like all my expenses of like (3:55 - 3:59)
what was this trip for what did you buy (3:57 - 4:03)
at the pokon set like that kind of stuff (3:59 - 4:06)
so I was like organizing all of that and (4:03 - 4:11)
I finished at 400 (4:06 - 4:13)
a.m. and I and then I looked at the (4:11 - 4:14)
clock cuz I wasn&#39;t looking at the clock (4:13 - 4:17)
and I was like oh no it&#39;s 4:00 a.m. and (4:14 - 4:20)
I like ran into my bedroom to like start (4:17 - 4:23)
the Pokeball plus but it it was too late (4:20 - 4:25)
it was already 4:00 a.m. it was already (4:23 - 4:27)
I needed to hit it at (4:25 - 4:29)
359 cuz I was like oh I&#39;m on track of (4:27 - 4:33)
getting done before 4: whatever and so I (4:29 - 4:37)
hit it at like 4 a.m. and so it tracked (4:33 - 4:40)
Thursday instead of Wednesday and then (4:37 - 4:44)
it it&#39;s I got like a 98% sleep that day (4:40 - 4:46)
but on Thursday so that means when I (4:44 - 4:49)
went to bed to Thursday to Friday it (4:46 - 4:52)
only it only goes up to 100 fun fact (4:49 - 4:56)
like so my next sleep session was only (4:52 - 5:00)
2% yeah and so if you&#39;re if you&#39;re (4:56 - 5:02)
Pokemon are already like low on energy (5:00 - 5:04)
there&#39;s no way to get them more energy (5:02 - 5:06)
at that point without (5:04 - 5:09)
waiting the next day you could give them (5:06 - 5:11)
pillows yeah you have the pillows the (5:09 - 5:13)
items you always say that have no (5:11 - 5:16)
purpose that has a purpose the scam (5:13 - 5:19)
though they charge you for that just (5:16 - 5:20)
build up a collection from all the free (5:19 - 5:24)
ones yeah I use my free pillows but like (5:20 - 5:27)
if you&#39;re if you&#39;re truly a free-to-play (5:24 - 5:29)
player and you don&#39;t have like the (5:27 - 5:31)
pillows or even if you&#39;re in Bobby (5:29 - 5:32)
situation where they probably don&#39;t have (5:31 - 5:35)
like I&#39;m assuming Bobby doesn&#39;t have 14 (5:32 - 5:39)
pillows I have a lot of them I think (5:35 - 5:41)
really I didn&#39;t buy them or anything (5:39 - 5:43)
they just give that many pillows at the (5:41 - 5:45)
start they do let me look I haven&#39;t used (5:43 - 5:47)
any of them yet that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing (5:45 - 5:49)
that&#39;s why you would use the pillows but (5:47 - 5:50)
even okay so here&#39;s the thing too even (5:49 - 5:53)
if you&#39;re like 2% energy you can&#39;t get (5:50 - 5:55)
away using a recovery cu the recovery (5:53 - 5:57)
just doubles the two so all you&#39;re (5:55 - 6:01)
getting is four the next day (5:57 - 6:03)
it&#39;s really (6:01 - 6:03)
bad check I the worst part wasn&#39;t even (6:05 - 6:09)
like (6:07 - 6:11)
missing like the 4:00 a.m. even though (6:09 - 6:15)
that was like not encouraging good sleep (6:11 - 6:17)
habits because I was stressed that I (6:15 - 6:21)
missed my time the worst part was like (6:17 - 6:24)
that was like 70 raicho Mains I probably (6:21 - 6:29)
missed out yeah yep and now I&#39;m like (6:24 - 6:32)
literally like 30 Mains short before the (6:29 - 6:35)
store closes to get another incense and (6:32 - 6:38)
I&#39;m thinking and the only options in the (6:35 - 6:42)
store is like a 25 or like a 50 50 and (6:38 - 6:45)
the 50 is like 600 and the 25 I think (6:42 - 6:48)
was like 200 Gems or something 250 I was (6:45 - 6:51)
looking at them this (6:48 - 6:53)
morning um so I went this whole event (6:51 - 6:54)
without (6:53 - 6:58)
buying any raicho stuff and now I think (6:54 - 7:00)
I have to buy one of them cuz I just I (6:58 - 7:02)
want another incense (7:00 - 7:05)
for the possibility of like the last (7:02 - 7:07)
raicho sleep style that I&#39;m (7:05 - 7:09)
missing right so did you get a you got a (7:07 - 7:14)
main skill seed though right oh (7:09 - 7:14)
yeah that was the best it of there I got (7:14 - 7:19)
one too I got one too don&#39;t worry oh you (7:17 - 7:21)
got made okay so you&#39;re okay freeto play (7:19 - 7:24)
Bobby three weeks old you caught a Rao (7:21 - 7:28)
and you got the main skill seed without (7:24 - 7:30)
spendo I got well I used the m Master (7:28 - 7:31)
biskuit right for the first one so (7:30 - 7:34)
there&#39;s that I caught two REO I got a (7:31 - 7:37)
main skill seed I got I used another REO (7:34 - 7:41)
incense last night or this morning um (7:37 - 7:44)
and then I still (7:41 - 7:48)
have 200 Romain and I haven&#39;t spent any (7:44 - 7:49)
diamonds on any of the bundles or (7:48 - 7:51)
anything like that so that&#39;s all just (7:49 - 7:53)
from playing the game over the last two (7:51 - 7:57)
weeks uh and I only got I only got two (7:53 - 7:59)
raicho main from friends over that two (7:57 - 8:02)

Stuart from the (8:05 - 8:08)
slack that&#39;s (8:06 - 8:11)
it gosh I got so much from friends I was (8:08 - 8:13)
getting like two that&#39;s that&#39;s wild I (8:11 - 8:17)
would only get three or four a night I (8:13 - 8:21)
got two total when I when I missed that (8:17 - 8:23)
Wednesday and then it messed up my (8:21 - 8:25)
Thursday and then I like finally fixed (8:23 - 8:29)
it Friday those like that like 72 hours (8:25 - 8:31)
I felt like I didn&#39;t get any from (8:29 - 8:34)
Friends okay I guess it&#39;s multiple per (8:31 - 8:36)
per friend but I get at most three or (8:34 - 8:40)
four friends per night with rumain by (8:36 - 8:42)
the way I have 10 energy pillows and (8:40 - 8:44)
that&#39;s I haven&#39;t done anything (8:42 - 8:46)
to go out on my way to get energy (8:44 - 8:49)
pillows I think like there&#39;s like tasks (8:46 - 8:50)
at the beginning it&#39;s been so it&#39;s been (8:49 - 8:52)
like eight months but it&#39;s like you (8:50 - 8:54)
probably like saw 10 bug Pokemon here&#39;s (8:52 - 8:58)
a pillow saw caught yes so actually I (8:54 - 9:00)
have one right now there&#39;s you you (8:58 - 9:02)
raised 10 Pokemon to a specified level (9:00 - 9:04)
you studied five ground Pokemon you (9:02 - 9:06)
studied Five Ghost type Pokemon or (9:04 - 9:08)
that&#39;s just what I got this morning like (9:06 - 9:11)
right now and for that I got 3,900 dream (9:08 - 9:13)
shards an ice stone and two poke (9:11 - 9:15)
biscuits and that was just like oh yeah (9:13 - 9:17)
because I think I think there&#39;s like two (9:15 - 9:19)
guaranteed free thunderstones at a (9:17 - 9:21)
certain point too I have a leaf stone (9:19 - 9:23)
that I got somewhere I have no idea (9:21 - 9:24)
where I yeah leaf stone is like the very (9:23 - 9:27)
one of the very first ones you get okay (9:24 - 9:28)
yeah Hannah did you get your main skill (9:27 - 9:31)
seed I did get my main skill seed and I (9:28 - 9:33)
had aicho show up without an incense (9:31 - 9:35)
this morning oh and I was able to catch (9:33 - 9:38)
it so I got my second Raichu right (9:35 - 9:43)
before the end I have almost enough M (9:38 - 9:47)
left to get the Thunderstone which I was (9:43 - 9:49)
really kind of angling for because I (9:47 - 9:51)
would like to get it in the main shop (9:49 - 9:55)
instead of in the main shop (9:51 - 10:00)
um spelled differently there nice um (9:55 - 10:04)
but I I&#39;m missing about (10:00 - 10:04)
eight so we&#39;ll see if I go for the1 to (10:07 - 10:12)
get that (10:10 - 10:15)
pun really really delayed this (10:12 - 10:18)
[Laughter] (10:15 - 10:21)
morning yeah so I I may end up getting (10:18 - 10:27)
the $1 um box or the the the cheapest of (10:21 - 10:30)
the boxes that I would only need to yeah (10:27 - 10:32)
ultimately more than $1 but I have some (10:30 - 10:35)
diamonds that I can combine with (10:32 - 10:39)
$1 yeah I spent my free diamonds on the (10:35 - 10:43)
den box which is like 1,500 (10:39 - 10:46)
back and I&#39;m I worked my way back up to (10:43 - 10:47)
a thousand free diamonds this game is (10:46 - 10:50)
very generous with (10:47 - 10:52)
diamonds but I don&#39;t know if I I didn&#39;t (10:50 - 10:54)
want to spend it on (10:52 - 10:58)
raicho but I yeah I want one more (10:54 - 11:00)
incense (10:58 - 11:02)
I haven&#39;t spent anything yet so I so (11:00 - 11:04)
sorry I spent I did spend money on the (11:02 - 11:06)
the master biscuit or not money the (11:04 - 11:09)
points or whatever not but I haven&#39;t (11:06 - 11:13)
spent any diamonds yet so I have 2,300 (11:09 - 11:17)
diamonds right now oh nice I have like (11:13 - 11:20)
6,000 sleep points or whatever but I (11:17 - 11:22)
don&#39;t know like I just haven&#39;t really (11:20 - 11:24)
looked into like okay because I was (11:22 - 11:25)
thinking I was going to spend diamonds (11:24 - 11:28)
on the REO bundles like a REO bundle at (11:25 - 11:29)
the beginning of this event thinking it (11:28 - 11:32)
was going to be tougher to get one to (11:29 - 11:34)
show up and that clearly has not been (11:32 - 11:37)
the case so now I&#39;m like oh well now I (11:34 - 11:38)
have all these diamonds that I didn&#39;t (11:37 - 11:40)
end up spending um and I just haven&#39;t (11:38 - 11:42)
looked at like what you know what to (11:40 - 11:46)
spend them on so well the news here is (11:42 - 11:49)
they announced that ente and suun are (11:46 - 11:51)
coming that not that (11:49 - 11:54)
that&#39;s news because they definitely (11:51 - 11:56)
announced that on Pokemon day that all (11:54 - 11:59)
three were coming but they they were but (11:56 - 12:01)
they then (11:59 - 12:03)
said yeah they showed all three in the (12:01 - 12:06)
Pokemon day okay cuz the the initial (12:03 - 12:09)
thing was like raicho sleeping in the in (12:06 - 12:12)
the room with the kid or not the kid it (12:09 - 12:13)
was like an (12:12 - 12:16)
adult and then at the end it shows all (12:13 - 12:18)
three of them and then the like phone (12:16 - 12:21)
and then it&#39;s like coming soon and then (12:18 - 12:23)
this like two days ago on Twitter they (12:21 - 12:25)
were like oh ente and raicho are coming (12:23 - 12:28)
soon I would assume that suun would be (12:25 - 12:30)
on the (12:28 - 12:33)
beach and then raicho would be on the (12:30 - 12:39)
volcano that&#39;s water and fire topalo (12:33 - 12:40)
gosh not the (12:39 - 12:43)
volcano that I just got I just unlocked (12:40 - 12:46)
that area this morning what do you think (12:43 - 12:47)
I guess you haven&#39;t been there I haven&#39;t (12:46 - 12:49)
been there yet do I go there should I (12:47 - 12:51)
only been on green grass right yeah (12:49 - 12:53)
whatever the first island is cyan I (12:51 - 12:54)
think is the first one that they make (12:53 - 12:56)
you like when you play the first week (12:54 - 12:57)
they make you green grass is the first (12:56 - 13:01)
one and then Canan Beach Canan Beach is (12:57 - 13:03)
the second one when I played the first (13:01 - 13:05)
week I wasn&#39;t on green grass before the (13:03 - 13:07)
raicho event I wasn&#39;t on green grass I (13:05 - 13:09)
was playing some other place that they (13:07 - 13:10)
made you (13:09 - 13:13)
play I didn&#39;t get to choose the first (13:10 - 13:15)
location when I started the game three (13:13 - 13:16)
we I think you were still on green grass (13:15 - 13:19)
it was just not the REO changed green (13:16 - 13:20)
grass a little bit looks a little (13:19 - 13:23)
different okay so green grass is the (13:20 - 13:24)
first location that you like are forced (13:23 - 13:26)
to play on when you first play the game (13:24 - 13:27)
mhm okay well then I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m (13:26 - 13:30)
talking about but uh so green grass (13:27 - 13:31)
changes they&#39;ll like put holiday stuff (13:30 - 13:33)
there or spooky stuff yeah well it (13:31 - 13:34)
probably they haven&#39;t done that to any (13:33 - 13:36)
other Island yet there was like there&#39;s (13:34 - 13:38)
like lightning and stuff yeah yeah (13:36 - 13:39)
that&#39;s just green grass but with (13:38 - 13:45)
lightning yeah okay so so I yeah so I (13:39 - 13:46)

listening to if I&#39;m listening to stuff I (14:18 - 14:21)
don&#39;t I want to make it louder so I&#39;ll (14:19 - 14:22)
put airpods in so I can just hear it (14:21 - 14:24)
that way and then I&#39;ll go open up (14:22 - 14:26)
Pokemon sleep for something and it will (14:24 - 14:28)
pause everything on my TV to be like no (14:26 - 14:31)
now you&#39;re playing Pokemon sleep Pokemon (14:28 - 14:34)
sleep&#39;s audio is so weird (14:31 - 14:38)
like like this level of priority of like (14:34 - 14:41)
we it is our time now you&#39;ve opened this (14:38 - 14:43)
app (14:41 - 14:47)
yep so uh that&#39;s when I hear the (14:43 - 14:51)
music I would be disappointed if they (14:47 - 14:54)
did suun and ente on green grass but I (14:51 - 14:58)
understand why they would do it they (14:54 - 15:01)
haven&#39;t when they they haven&#39;t done a (14:58 - 15:04)
single event per a single Island they (15:01 - 15:05)
have done events where it&#39;s like this (15:04 - 15:07)
event can be on multiple islands and you (15:05 - 15:08)
get to (15:07 - 15:11)
choose but they H if if it&#39;s a single (15:08 - 15:13)
targeted event they force you to go to (15:11 - 15:15)
green grass which makes sense because (15:13 - 15:17)
like what (15:15 - 15:20)
if suun is on the beach and then (15:17 - 15:22)
somebody just started playing the day (15:20 - 15:24)
before and now they don&#39;t have the beach (15:22 - 15:26)
but they would have green grass like I (15:24 - 15:31)
get it um but suun being water in the (15:26 - 15:33)
beach always having the water thing (15:31 - 15:35)
would make sense there were some people (15:33 - 15:36)
that were like oh suun is going to be in (15:35 - 15:39)
lapis but like why would that make sense (15:36 - 15:41)
su&#39;s like suun doesn&#39;t have a secondary (15:39 - 15:44)
type it&#39;s just water like yeah maybe (15:41 - 15:46)
like thematically visually thematically (15:44 - 15:49)
it Vis yeah visually and thematically is (15:46 - 15:50)
lapis like (15:49 - 15:55)
a what is lapis okay so uh green grass (15:50 - 15:58)
has random berries every week okay yep (15:55 - 15:59)
but when you get to this the other (15:58 - 16:02)
Islands they have forced berries so lap (15:59 - 16:05)
or so so the beach will always have an (16:02 - 16:06)
Oran Berry and I can&#39;t remember the (16:05 - 16:09)
other two but Oran is the water Berry so (16:06 - 16:10)
it&#39;s like the berry that Squirtle has (16:09 - 16:13)
it&#39;s the berry that like Psyduck has (16:10 - 16:14)
because they&#39;re water Pokemon because (16:13 - 16:16)
everything in this game is single type (16:14 - 16:18)
and then when you get to to Apollo (16:16 - 16:22)
that&#39;s um that&#39;s Rock because geodude&#39;s (16:18 - 16:25)
there um and I I don&#39;t even remember the (16:22 - 16:26)
other ones it&#39;s like rock and something (16:25 - 16:29)
else any but when you get to lapis (16:26 - 16:32)
lapis is like the final Island the the (16:29 - 16:33)
First new island they introduced since (16:32 - 16:38)
the game came out um lapis is like it&#39;s (16:33 - 16:40)
fighting because I know like Stuffle is (16:38 - 16:43)
there and then it&#39;s is it (16:40 - 16:45)
psychic because Ral is there right I (16:43 - 16:48)
know rson is (16:45 - 16:51)
there but but like you have to have (16:48 - 16:53)
specific teams for those (16:51 - 16:56)
islands um whereas like green grass (16:53 - 16:58)
you&#39;re changing your team based on like (16:56 - 17:01)
the berri that generate mhm it&#39;s just (16:58 - 17:03)
the one Barry the electric Barry was (17:01 - 17:05)
locked to green grass for the last two (17:03 - 17:07)
weeks that&#39;s why people just did (17:05 - 17:09)
electric type Pokemon there is no island (17:07 - 17:11)
with an electric type Berry (17:09 - 17:16)
yet so got it um that&#39;s why like raicho (17:11 - 17:19)
is not good like it&#39;s been two weeks (17:16 - 17:20)
raicho is like not good to put on your (17:19 - 17:23)
team at this point we will see I&#39;m gonna (17:20 - 17:26)
keep going with my all electric team and (17:23 - 17:28)
see how it holds up when it&#39;s not during (17:26 - 17:31)
this event because I really like my all (17:28 - 17:33)
electric team that I&#39;ve built for this (17:31 - 17:35)
event and raicho is on (17:33 - 17:37)
there it would make sense though if they (17:35 - 17:39)
ended up doing another one of those (17:37 - 17:40)
events for ente and (17:39 - 17:44)
suun individually where for suun they (17:40 - 17:47)
did both the beach and green (17:44 - 17:49)
grass oh where you could pick that would (17:47 - 17:53)
be cool yeah yeah that would be I would (17:49 - 17:54)
have liked to not be on green grass (17:53 - 17:57)
again this week since I&#39;ve only like (17:54 - 17:58)
three weeks in this game and you&#39;re like (17:57 - 18:01)
already sick get green grass (17:58 - 18:03)
yeah so I would have liked to be able to (18:01 - 18:05)
choose something else uh and I guess I (18:03 - 18:08)
could have but I still wanted (18:05 - 18:11)
to you know go with get the REO stuff (18:08 - 18:13)
and all that and do that stuff so yeah I (18:11 - 18:15)
don&#39;t know my hair is out of control (18:13 - 18:17)
today I don&#39;t know where look I went to (18:15 - 18:19)
a concert last (18:17 - 18:22)
night EXC my hair is not (18:19 - 18:24)
cooperating um I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m (18:22 - 18:26)
going to go I guess I&#39;m like I&#39;m pretty (18:24 - 18:29)
close to finishing the beach so maybe I (18:26 - 18:30)
maybe I just finish off the beach so (18:29 - 18:35)
then if suun is on the beach I&#39;m at the (18:30 - 18:39)
55% going in so maybe I just do that or (18:35 - 18:42)
I could try topalo again and be angry (18:39 - 18:44)
for a full week just turn on the music (18:42 - 18:47)
and you won&#39;t be Ang as angry be angry (18:44 - 18:51)
because I won&#39;t get the onx um uh so one (18:47 - 18:52)
thing that was interesting about this (18:51 - 18:55)
week was they started us all at Ultra 4 (18:52 - 18:57)
which we had talked about potentially (18:55 - 18:59)
happening last week we said like we were (18:57 - 19:01)
saying it might happen has that happened (18:59 - 19:03)
before in the game or is this the first (19:01 - 19:05)
time that they have done (19:03 - 19:07)
that this is the first time they&#39;ve done (19:05 - 19:09)
that this is the first time they&#39;ve done (19:07 - 19:12)
anything like that I think I I&#39;m pretty (19:09 - 19:14)
sure there&#39;s never been a chance for (19:12 - 19:16)
anyone to start out at a higher level (19:14 - 19:22)
than base Pokeball one okay at any point (19:16 - 19:26)
we were all master rank something right (19:22 - 19:30)
and then it dropped us all four mhm yeah (19:26 - 19:33)
Master ranks two or three maybe nice (19:30 - 19:35)
yeah I&#39;m just (19:33 - 19:39)
curious if you were let&#39;s just say you (19:35 - 19:41)
were Ultra 3 and the week started over (19:39 - 19:44)
did they bump you to ultra four I have (19:41 - 19:46)
no clue because everyone I&#39;ve talked to (19:44 - 19:48)
was master rank yeah that&#39;s the thing if (19:46 - 19:50)
even Bobby who started out the week (19:48 - 19:52)
before was able to get to master rank in (19:50 - 19:55)
that first week of this event yeah yeah (19:52 - 19:58)
so yeah I don&#39;t know I it made it seem (19:55 - 20:01)
like it was going to be ultra 4 was (19:58 - 20:03)
going to be the lowest maybe it was (20:01 - 20:06)
something I saw online or talking to (20:03 - 20:08)
someone but it seemed like that was (20:06 - 20:10)
where they were starting everybody was (20:08 - 20:12)
Ultra 4 but I I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know (20:10 - 20:14)
if to find someone who didn&#39;t get to (20:12 - 20:16)
ultra four the week before the week (20:14 - 20:18)
before yeah or maybe didn&#39;t play but (20:16 - 20:20)
then picked it up the second (20:18 - 20:23)
week uh last question before we move on (20:20 - 20:26)
uh Bobby do you regret using your master (20:23 - 20:30)
ball uh no I I have not come across (20:26 - 20:32)
anything else that I feel like I would (20:30 - 20:35)
want to use it on at this point and I (20:32 - 20:37)
now have plenty of sleep points to get (20:35 - 20:41)
another one since it&#39;s April now so yeah (20:37 - 20:44)
I it&#39;s fine I&#39;m happy with the (20:41 - 20:46)
experience of using a master ball on a (20:44 - 20:49)
raicho because that just (20:46 - 20:52)
feels nostalgic I&#39;ve done that before no (20:49 - 20:54)
no shade to anyone but the amount of (20:52 - 20:56)
players I know that use their master (20:54 - 20:59)
ball in a Shiny Pokemon is very (20:56 - 21:02)
high and I think a lot of those people (20:59 - 21:04)
were very bummed to find out that you (21:02 - 21:06)
just needed to use just a Pokeball and (21:04 - 21:09)
it would have caught so they probably (21:06 - 21:11)
regret using their Master Ball in (21:09 - 21:14)
Pokemon sleep yeah people figured that (21:11 - 21:16)
out real quick though all right oh all (21:14 - 21:20)
the time like I I know I (21:16 - 21:24)
know five people in the slack that once (21:20 - 21:26)
they found out that you could just use a (21:24 - 21:28)
Pokeball they were all like oh I I (21:26 - 21:31)
wasted my m all yeah I think because I (21:28 - 21:33)
knew that and I wouldn&#39;t have if it (21:31 - 21:36)
wasn&#39;t for talking to both of you but (21:33 - 21:38)
because uh because I knew that that (21:36 - 21:39)
would be the only other thing that I (21:38 - 21:42)
would really at this point was you know (21:39 - 21:44)
was thinking about that I would want to (21:42 - 21:45)
use something like a master ball on and (21:44 - 21:49)
so when it was uh revealed to me that (21:45 - 21:52)
you didn&#39;t need to then I thought okay (21:49 - 21:55)
I&#39;ll just use it on (21:52 - 21:55)
REO I I wonder with like suun and ente (21:55 - 22:02)
like for raicho we got extra lucky I (21:58 - 22:04)
guess because they gave us a free (22:02 - 22:07)
incense right and they gave us two free (22:04 - 22:09)
biscuits (22:07 - 22:12)
mhh and like even we all said like we (22:09 - 22:15)
all got main skill seed we all got two (22:12 - 22:17)
Ros I probably could have got a third (22:15 - 22:19)
raicho pretty easily if I didn&#39;t miss a (22:17 - 22:22)
day you know (22:19 - 22:26)
um so I think I think still just as easy (22:22 - 22:28)
to get suun and (22:26 - 22:31)
ente (22:28 - 22:31)
but again like like an incense and two (22:32 - 22:39)
biscuits is like what like at least 250 (22:35 - 22:42)
main yeah well the second week they made (22:39 - 22:43)
the in they gave us some incense and (22:42 - 22:45)
biscuits that were a little bit cheaper (22:43 - 22:47)
so yeah was like one incense and two (22:45 - 22:49)
biscuits were slightly cheaper yeah I (22:47 - 22:50)
think you can get one incense and two (22:49 - 22:55)
biscuits for 170 main um the second week (22:50 - 22:57)
cuz it was 50 for two 50 for each (22:55 - 22:59)
biscuit and 70 for (22:57 - 23:03)
sense um so yeah I mean and if you&#39;re (22:59 - 23:06)
like this morning when I woke up and um (23:03 - 23:09)
my raicho that showed up was hungry but (23:06 - 23:11)
I didn&#39;t have I didn&#39;t have any raicho (23:09 - 23:13)
biscuits at the moment like and I was (23:11 - 23:14)
like oh do I want to go in and spend I (23:13 - 23:16)
already have two raicho and I was just (23:14 - 23:17)
like you know what never mind like it&#39;s (23:16 - 23:19)
I&#39;m good we&#39;re good (23:17 - 23:23)
like I&#39;m done with this raicho event now (23:19 - 23:26)
move on to the next thing none of my Ros (23:23 - 23:27)
were hungry (23:26 - 23:33)
ever sad I&#39;m sorry that you had wellfed (23:27 - 23:36)
Reiko (23:33 - 23:38)
yeah (23:36 - 23:41)
uh this was just announced before we (23:38 - 23:45)
started recording uh Pokemon worlds (23:41 - 23:47)
finally has a (23:45 - 23:50)
date uh (23:47 - 23:53)
which I think the real question is why (23:50 - 23:55)
did it take them so (23:53 - 24:00)
long was euic the last big International (23:55 - 24:01)
have the others all happened at this (24:00 - 24:06)
point uh no the um euic or euic just (24:01 - 24:10)
happened and then NAIC is right right (24:06 - 24:13)
right right NAIC is in July or August (24:10 - 24:15)
yeah (24:13 - 24:17)
June it&#39;s in June because (24:15 - 24:21)
um it&#39;s a it&#39;s the (24:17 - 24:24)
week (24:21 - 24:26)
after (24:24 - 24:29)
Sendai and it&#39;s the week before for (24:26 - 24:32)
Madrid so it&#39;s Sendai (24:29 - 24:37)
NAIC Madrid and it&#39;s in Ohio right niic (24:32 - 24:41)
it&#39;s it&#39;s usually in Ohio or Indian (24:37 - 24:45)
Indianapolis this time it&#39;s in uh new (24:41 - 24:48)
orle yeah that&#39;s right that&#39;s right (24:45 - 24:50)
that&#39;s a that&#39;d be that&#39;s fun be a fun (24:48 - 24:53)
one for sure yeah people people seemed (24:50 - 24:56)
really excited about it (24:53 - 24:59)
um uh (24:56 - 25:01)
it&#39;s going to be in Honolulu Hawaii (24:59 - 25:04)
August 16th through (25:01 - 25:06)
18th (25:04 - 25:09)
um because we know that they already (25:06 - 25:13)
booked the 2026 location not to not to (25:09 - 25:16)
be confused with the 20125 location next (25:13 - 25:18)
year we don&#39;t know where that is but (25:16 - 25:20)
shout out to that poor soul who worked (25:18 - 25:22)
at the (25:20 - 25:25)
the San Francisco venue to then say yeah (25:22 - 25:28)
we&#39;re hosting the Pokemon thing in 2026 (25:25 - 25:29)
that guy probably doesn&#39;t work there (25:28 - 25:32)
anymore (25:29 - 25:35)
um they they clearly book these things (25:32 - 25:39)
two plus years in advanced uh so yeah (25:35 - 25:40)
that (25:39 - 25:43)
makes I just I whether or not you&#39;re (25:40 - 25:46)
happy or upset or excited or frustrated (25:43 - 25:48)
that it&#39;s going to Hawaii I don&#39;t (25:46 - 25:50)
understand why they&#39;re they waited so (25:48 - 25:52)
long for these dates because I&#39;m pretty (25:50 - 25:55)
sure last year for Japan they announced (25:52 - 25:58)
the dates like around Pokemon day or (25:55 - 26:01)
like shortly after like it was pretty (25:58 - 26:05)
early in the year maybe it has to do (26:01 - 26:08)
with maybe they maybe they didn&#39;t have (26:05 - 26:11)
the dates fully firmed up with there&#39;s (26:08 - 26:13)
no yeah (26:11 - 26:16)
no I don&#39;t know why that&#39;s how that (26:13 - 26:17)
works I don&#39;t know why they would wait (26:16 - 26:19)
so long the only thing I could think of (26:17 - 26:20)
is (26:19 - 26:24)
doing uh making it more in advanced (26:20 - 26:26)
because a lot of the people that may be (26:24 - 26:29)
going when it was Japan would have to (26:26 - 26:32)
get to Japan and maybe they&#39;re like (26:29 - 26:34)
we&#39;re giving people and then with Hawaii (26:32 - 26:37)
still not an easy trip but maybe there&#39;s (26:34 - 26:38)
some difference there something about (26:37 - 26:41)
International versus National for a lot (26:38 - 26:42)
of the people that are going to be there (26:41 - 26:44)
CU I would imagine and maybe I&#39;m wrong I (26:42 - 26:46)
would imagine though that most of the (26:44 - 26:48)
people going to the worlds is are most (26:46 - 26:51)
of the people from North America or most (26:48 - 26:53)
of the people from Asia or Europe (26:51 - 26:55)
usually like do do you do we know the (26:53 - 26:59)
numbers on where people areer Japan have (26:55 - 27:01)
the mo and Japanese have the (26:59 - 27:05)
most right uh pres presents yeah that&#39;s (27:01 - 27:06)
the (27:05 - 27:08)
word that&#39;s weird I don&#39;t know that&#39;s (27:06 - 27:10)
that&#39;s really short timeline now if (27:08 - 27:11)
people are going to be buying tickets (27:10 - 27:14)
and things to get to Honolulu that&#39;s (27:11 - 27:17)
also just like a side note the reason (27:14 - 27:19)
they do pick Hawaii is because their two (27:17 - 27:21)
biggest audiences are America and Japan (27:19 - 27:22)
and Hawaii is literally in between those (27:21 - 27:25)
two countries so that that&#39;s (27:22 - 27:28)
like location wise it makes the most (27:25 - 27:31)
sense for it&#39;s a tourist destination for (27:28 - 27:35)
both of the countries yeah Japan like (27:31 - 27:39)
like I think Hawaii is one of Japan&#39;s (27:35 - 27:41)
top tourist locations like Hawaii and (27:39 - 27:44)
Japan are very (27:41 - 27:49)
close uh when it comes to culture and (27:44 - 27:51)
stuff (27:49 - 27:54)
I yeah we we&#39;ll we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how this (27:51 - 27:56)
turns out what I want I do want to talk (27:54 - 27:59)
about is the world&#39;s p is up the (27:56 - 28:03)
graphics are up and they did they did (27:59 - 28:05)
kill it with the graphics I think the (28:03 - 28:07)
the (28:05 - 28:10)
theme looks great uh it it&#39;s very (28:07 - 28:12)
colorful Pikachu and a little little (28:10 - 28:15)
little swimsuit little flippers (28:12 - 28:17)
uh they got they got some frillish they (28:15 - 28:20)
got some Riolu they got some quackley (28:17 - 28:21)
they got some gimme (28:20 - 28:25)
ghoul uh I like the way it (28:21 - 28:25)
looks little wishy-washy (28:26 - 28:30)
[Laughter] (28:28 - 28:33)
uh yeah I mean obviously if you know me (28:30 - 28:36)
at all alola I love alola I love (28:33 - 28:37)
everything around that so anything (28:36 - 28:41)
that&#39;s themed like beach alola or just (28:37 - 28:43)
Hawaii like all of that theming I love (28:41 - 28:44)
so I think they did a really good job on (28:43 - 28:48)
that as well um so good job Pokemon (28:44 - 28:50)
company he did great on the on the on (28:48 - 28:54)
the theming of this whole thing this is (28:50 - 28:55)
maybe a (28:54 - 28:57)
stretch do we think James Turner did (28:55 - 29:00)
this art before he (28:57 - 29:00)
left it&#39;s in a (29:01 - 29:04)
style it (29:05 - 29:11)
is and just realizing it is in his (29:07 - 29:16)
style it is 100% in his (29:11 - 29:16)
style I (29:17 - 29:23)
mean considering how far out they book (29:20 - 29:25)
these things that&#39;s very (29:23 - 29:30)
possible yeah cuz he was still he did (29:25 - 29:34)
like even though he left before scarlet (29:30 - 29:36)
and violet came out like he&#39;s gone on (29:34 - 29:39)
record saying like he did some Pokemon (29:36 - 29:40)
he did some graphics he did all the like (29:39 - 29:43)
the sandwich stuff like if when you go (29:40 - 29:47)
into one of the the the shops which is (29:43 - 29:49)
opening up a menu not actually going (29:47 - 29:50)
into the store and you look at the (29:49 - 29:52)
background of that stuff that&#39;s his (29:50 - 29:55)
artwork he did the professors he did (29:52 - 30:00)
design both Professor um both both (29:55 - 30:00)
professors but I&#39;m like I&#39;m looking (30:00 - 30:07)
at like the Pikachu and the Gimme goul (30:04 - 30:10)
and the steeny and it&#39;s all like (30:07 - 30:12)
everything here is like literally in his (30:10 - 30:13)
art style and I don&#39;t know anyone else (30:12 - 30:17)
at game freak that does the um not (30:13 - 30:19)
connected lines I will say like he (30:17 - 30:21)
didn&#39;t invent that art style there&#39;s (30:19 - 30:22)
other artists that don&#39;t connect their (30:21 - 30:27)
lines it&#39;s not like exclusive to him (30:22 - 30:33)
but anytime there&#39;s been nonconnected (30:27 - 30:36)
lines it&#39;s always been him so unless (30:33 - 30:38)
like there&#39;s a new artist that was like (30:36 - 30:40)
where I&#39;m I&#39;m going to copy which is (30:38 - 30:41)
possible there it&#39;s definitely possible (30:40 - 30:44)
for an artist to be like I want to to (30:41 - 30:47)
pay homage or I want to copy or take (30:44 - 30:49)
inspiration from his art (30:47 - 30:52)
style but this looks (30:49 - 30:56)
like this looks like his art style maybe (30:52 - 30:57)
I will say like I&#39;m not looking at like (30:56 - 31:00)
really close at the details of this and (30:57 - 31:02)
for one the two frillish with the little (31:00 - 31:04)
love disc right above them is really (31:02 - 31:06)
cute cuz it&#39;s like a little heart it&#39;s (31:04 - 31:08)
like the way it&#39;s going down it&#39;s like (31:06 - 31:09)
you know little heart right above the (31:08 - 31:12)
fish but the Riolu snorkeling while (31:09 - 31:15)
taking a picture of gamig might be my (31:12 - 31:18)
favorite like part of this and anything (31:15 - 31:21)
that Pokemon has done this year I love (31:18 - 31:23)
how you can still recognize it&#39;s a rolu (31:21 - 31:25)
even though it&#39;s hidden behind the (31:23 - 31:28)
camera and the snorkel and the flippers (31:25 - 31:31)
on its feet you can barely tell unless (31:28 - 31:36)
you know riola it&#39;s so good it&#39;s so (31:31 - 31:38)
good yeah this is great (31:36 - 31:42)
artwork could be James Turner I guess I (31:38 - 31:44)
I think the colors definitely help as (31:42 - 31:45)
well those are definitely colors that (31:44 - 31:47)
we&#39;ve seen James Turner like to work in (31:45 - 31:50)
even in kind of personal artworks he (31:47 - 31:53)
loves pink and blue so much great colors (31:50 - 31:56)
great (31:53 - 31:56)
colors I I think this is a (31:56 - 32:02)
start I can see it I I mean I I don&#39;t (31:59 - 32:04)
know all of the (32:02 - 32:06)
different differences between the (32:04 - 32:09)
Pokemon artists I&#39;ve only seen (32:06 - 32:11)
infographics on those a couple of times (32:09 - 32:13)
and I definitely haven&#39;t memorized them (32:11 - 32:15)
um but even I can see some of the (32:13 - 32:18)
similarities (32:15 - 32:18)
here well I (32:19 - 32:25)
guess we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see going forward if (32:21 - 32:29)
they&#39;re going to announce events or (32:25 - 32:31)
what the Pokemon Center would look like (32:29 - 32:34)
or what the merch is going to be um all (32:31 - 32:36)
that stuff going (32:34 - 32:39)
forward it&#39;s going to happen whether I (32:36 - 32:41)
mean it&#39;s it&#39;s happening regardless (32:39 - 32:42)
right again I know there&#39;s frustrations (32:41 - 32:43)
around Hawaii I know there&#39;s people that (32:42 - 32:45)
are very excited about Hawaii I know (32:43 - 32:48)
there&#39;s all that that all that stuff but (32:45 - 32:51)
we&#39;ll we&#39;ll keep reporting on if you are (32:48 - 32:54)
going because you are a competitor or (32:51 - 32:55)
because you&#39;re traveling with a (32:54 - 32:58)
competitor or you just happen to (32:55 - 33:03)
be in in Hawaii in (32:58 - 33:05)
August uh we&#39;ll see what events are (33:03 - 33:08)
related to it and if if it&#39;s going to be (33:05 - 33:10)
like the same impact of Japan because (33:08 - 33:13)
like when I talked about last year there (33:10 - 33:16)
were so many much going on right like (33:13 - 33:18)
there was just so much I missed because (33:16 - 33:20)
like there was just so much happening (33:18 - 33:23)
that it was very easy to miss stuff I (33:20 - 33:25)
cannot imagine that there&#39;s going to be (33:23 - 33:28)
so much here but there should be some (33:25 - 33:31)
stuff here yeah it&#39;ll be a good way to (33:28 - 33:33)
tell whether them going so all out last (33:31 - 33:36)
year was primarily because it was Japan (33:33 - 33:38)
or because they&#39;re really continuing to (33:36 - 33:41)
try and ramp up what worlds is because (33:38 - 33:43)
there has been a ramp up it has become a (33:41 - 33:45)
bigger and more involved event over the (33:43 - 33:48)
years well they definitely have a lot to (33:45 - 33:50)
follow up on because two years ago in (33:48 - 33:53)
London it was the first one back right (33:50 - 33:55)
so there was a kind it was a pretty big (33:53 - 33:57)
deal a lot of people were really excited (33:55 - 33:58)
about that and then you have the next (33:57 - 34:00)
year was in Japan which obviously they (33:58 - 34:03)
were going all out for so yeah to your (34:00 - 34:04)
point is that going to stay are they (34:03 - 34:06)
going to stay with that coming into (34:04 - 34:09)
Hawaii and kind of keep that energy (34:06 - 34:12)
going and keep that um that push or you (34:09 - 34:15)
know is it going to kind of cool back (34:12 - 34:18)
down a little bit but I would love it if (34:15 - 34:21)
they kept if they kept it ramped up um I (34:18 - 34:22)
I think that would be great I think that (34:21 - 34:23)
would be great if that&#39;s kind of what (34:22 - 34:25)
they&#39;re they&#39;re doing now um although I (34:23 - 34:27)
guess if you&#39;re there it might feel like (34:25 - 34:29)
you might miss out on things and you&#39;re (34:27 - 34:31)
already there but I I don&#39;t I think it (34:29 - 34:33)
would be cool to keep it keep the energy (34:31 - 34:35)
High keep it where it&#39;s at keep it (34:33 - 34:37)
ramped up there hasn&#39;t been any news of (34:35 - 34:39)
any Lottery systems (34:37 - 34:42)
yet (34:39 - 34:45)
right not yet well I&#39;m sure I&#39;m sure (34:42 - 34:47)
there&#39;ll be a Pokemon go event I&#39;m sure (34:45 - 34:49)
they&#39;ll probably also boost the amount (34:47 - 34:52)
of comet spawning for people to then get (34:49 - 34:56)
those to then come back and trade um but (34:52 - 34:57)
speaking of Pokémon go we have a little (34:56 - 34:59)
bit of Pokemon go news we actually have (34:57 - 35:00)
some scarlet and violet news this week (34:59 - 35:02)
so uh we&#39;re going to take a quick break (35:00 - 35:04)
and we come back we&#39;re going to talk (35:02 - 35:07)
about those two things so we will be (35:04 - 35:10)
right back and we are back from our (35:07 - 35:15)
break uh okay so pokemon.com published (35:10 - 35:18)
an article on April 3rd how to catch (35:15 - 35:21)
shiny Pokemon in Pokemon scarlet and (35:18 - 35:24)
violet uh there&#39;s not anything (35:21 - 35:26)
particularly new (35:24 - 35:29)
here uh they this is not the first time (35:26 - 35:31)
they&#39;ve published a shiny article they (35:29 - 35:33)
did one for sword and shield that no one (35:31 - 35:36)
believed uh and then that one ended up (35:33 - 35:38)
being correct uh and then they did one (35:36 - 35:40)
for let&#39;s go Pikachu let&#39;s go Eevee that (35:38 - 35:43)
also no one believed and that ended up (35:40 - 35:45)
being correct as well I want to stress (35:43 - 35:46)
that (35:45 - 35:49)
because people for both those games (35:46 - 35:52)
thought shiny hunting was broken or at (35:49 - 35:55)
least in let go they thought oh I just (35:52 - 35:56)
knock out 30 and then get on my (35:55 - 35:58)
Charizard and then wait (35:56 - 36:00)
and then why aren&#39;t I getting Shiny (35:58 - 36:02)
Pokemon (36:00 - 36:05)
um SB was wrong on both of those games (36:02 - 36:08)
for three plus years each (36:05 - 36:10)
that&#39;s every every site was wrong to be (36:08 - 36:13)
fair not other than (36:10 - 36:15)
pokemon.com other than pokemon.com was (36:13 - 36:18)
the right site we now know that (36:15 - 36:20)
pokemon.com was right and then let&#39;s go (36:18 - 36:22)
in order to actually shiny hunt you have (36:20 - 36:26)
to keep catching over and over I believe (36:22 - 36:27)
the title of that article if you&#39;re (36:26 - 36:30)
looking for for it is keep that catch (36:27 - 36:33)
combo going that that should if you pop (36:30 - 36:36)
that into Google that&#39;ll pop up but (36:33 - 36:38)
still on pokemon.com still explains how (36:36 - 36:41)
to do it um and then the same thing with (36:38 - 36:44)
scarlet and VI or sorry sword and shield (36:41 - 36:46)
which was uh talking about brilliant (36:44 - 36:49)
Pokemon and you know three years later (36:46 - 36:51)
after sarabe and everyone else said that (36:49 - 36:53)
brilliant Pokemon didn&#39;t do anything (36:51 - 36:56)
brilliant Pokemon did have an extra (36:53 - 36:59)
shiny role to them (36:56 - 37:02)
and that would be permanently increased (36:59 - 37:04)
based on how many you either caught or (37:02 - 37:07)
knocked out which was all on pokemon.com (37:04 - 37:08)
that people (37:07 - 37:12)
just did not believe they believed SB be (37:08 - 37:14)
over that or Bulbapedia over that and (37:12 - 37:16)
and those those sites were wrong and (37:14 - 37:18)
then you know we wouldn&#39;t be talking (37:16 - 37:19)
about this without (37:18 - 37:22)
Anubis who (37:19 - 37:26)
she tested these theories and and proved (37:22 - 37:29)
that pokemon.com was right on both of (37:26 - 37:32)
those games uh and then I think since (37:29 - 37:34)
then Sarah B Bulbapedia everyone else (37:32 - 37:37)
has updated to the to Right Stuff um so (37:34 - 37:39)
the title of this is how to catch shiny (37:37 - 37:41)
Pokemon in scarlet and violet the weird (37:39 - 37:44)
thing here is both the the letco article (37:41 - 37:46)
and the sword and shield article came (37:44 - 37:49)
out within a month of the games coming (37:46 - 37:52)
out they they came out super short much (37:49 - 37:54)
quicker and this has been well over a (37:52 - 37:57)
year obviously and now they published an (37:54 - 37:59)
article if (37:57 - 38:02)
well it&#39;s a lot more direct ing (37:59 - 38:06)
game in scarland there are actually (38:02 - 38:08)
things like sparkling power on screen (38:06 - 38:10)
that you can (38:08 - 38:10)
see yeah that that&#39;s that&#39;s very true um (38:11 - 38:17)
and it does seem that the The Twist here (38:14 - 38:19)
is and I just didn&#39;t like set up like (38:17 - 38:21)
the let&#39;s go to be like and once again (38:19 - 38:24)
Sarah is wrong no it seems like what is (38:21 - 38:28)
in this article is whatever everyone has (38:24 - 38:32)
been doing the entire time uh tells you (38:28 - 38:34)
how to get your shiny (38:32 - 38:36)
charm um and then it drops down to mass (38:34 - 38:38)
outbreaks so it says the easiest way to (38:36 - 38:40)
find a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon scarlet (38:38 - 38:42)
and violet is through mass outbreaks uh (38:40 - 38:44)
it&#39;s when the same species appear in one (38:42 - 38:46)
location as you battle and catch the (38:44 - 38:48)
Pokemon appearing your chances of (38:46 - 38:49)
encountering a Shiny Pokemon will (38:48 - 38:52)
increase three different messages will (38:49 - 38:55)
appear during the outbreak um the number (38:52 - 38:57)
of Pokemon is starting to go down the (38:55 - 38:59)
number of Pokemon in an outbreak is (38:57 - 39:01)
definitely getting lower and the N there (38:59 - 39:03)
are not many Pokemon left in the (39:01 - 39:05)
original outbreak you have the highest (39:03 - 39:07)
chance of encountering a shiny when you (39:05 - 39:09)
receive the message that says not there (39:07 - 39:11)
are not that many Pokemon left in the (39:09 - 39:13)
original outbreak at this point it is (39:11 - 39:15)
best to avoid catching or defeating and (39:13 - 39:17)
keep your eyes peeled for a Shiny (39:15 - 39:19)
Pokemon if you&#39;re looking to find one if (39:17 - 39:21)
you wander to a new location or set up a (39:19 - 39:23)
picnic and return to the m Mass outbreak (39:21 - 39:26)
you may find a new group of the same (39:23 - 39:29)
species has appeared and that these new (39:26 - 39:31)
encounters don&#39;t cause the Pokemon to (39:29 - 39:34)
disappear from the mass outbreak easiest (39:31 - 39:35)
way (39:34 - 39:37)
to easiest way to battle and defeat the (39:35 - 39:41)
mass outbreak is through Auto Battle uh (39:37 - 39:42)
it&#39;s best to consider the terrain for (39:41 - 39:45)
example if it&#39;s over a body of water (39:42 - 39:46)
you&#39;ll want a Pokemon that can swim and (39:45 - 39:49)
fly for Pokemon on for outbreaks on land (39:46 - 39:51)
use Pokemon that move quickly such as (39:49 - 39:54)
galade or suru Edge that&#39;s true suru (39:51 - 39:56)
Edge is very very (39:54 - 39:58)
quick even if if you&#39;re not lucky enough (39:56 - 40:00)
to find a shiny Pokemon mass outbreaks (39:58 - 40:02)
are still a great way to C collect (40:00 - 40:05)
Pokemon materials that can be made into (40:02 - 40:08)
TMS exchang for leak points and used at (40:05 - 40:10)
the item printer in blueberry Academy (40:08 - 40:13)
keep in mind you can only hold 999 999 (40:10 - 40:16)
of at a given type and new mass (40:13 - 40:19)
outbreaks appear daily at midnight local (40:16 - 40:22)
time in Pala kakami and (40:19 - 40:22)
blueberry and then they have an even (40:23 - 40:29)
more long longer section of this that (40:26 - 40:33)
breaks down sparkling (40:29 - 40:33)
power and they talk about how you can (40:33 - 40:37)
get urbom mystica through five and six (40:36 - 40:39)
star (40:37 - 40:42)
raids uh now recently Seven Star raids (40:39 - 40:45)
actually seems like the last four seven (40:42 - 40:48)
star raids have all dropped Hera (40:45 - 40:52)
mystica um you can mix and match (40:48 - 40:53)
although you need at least two herb (40:52 - 40:56)
mystica for sparkling (40:53 - 40:58)
power I&#39;m not going to go through all (40:56 - 41:00)
the sparkling power for for that lists (40:58 - 41:02)
all of them well it lists one (41:00 - 41:05)
combination for each of the (41:02 - 41:08)
types (41:05 - 41:10)
yeah uh they also do say that you can go (41:08 - 41:12)
to Blueberry Academy spend 150 blueberry (41:10 - 41:16)
points for activating all Sparkle power (41:12 - 41:18)
all types it&#39;s not as potent as a (41:16 - 41:20)
sandwich made in picnic it is a level (41:18 - 41:22)
one instead of a level three but (41:20 - 41:24)
increases your chance of finding a shiny (41:22 - 41:27)
Pokemon for all 18 types at once a great (41:24 - 41:28)
meal if if you were just walking (41:27 - 41:31)
[Music] (41:28 - 41:34)
around uh and then at the very (41:31 - 41:37)
end if you need to catch Pokemon you can (41:34 - 41:41)
use the moves Spore and false (41:37 - 41:41)
swipe it they specifically say a Brum (41:41 - 41:46)
that knows the moves Spore and false (41:45 - 41:49)
Swip because they know that that&#39;s the (41:46 - 41:51)
Pokemon were they listening to the (41:49 - 41:53)
podcast last week when I said I&#39;m so (41:51 - 41:56)
sick of using Spore and false swipe for (41:53 - 41:59)
every (41:56 - 41:59)
uh I will say I&#39;ve done quite a bit I (41:59 - 42:04)
mean I&#39;ve done some shiny hunting in (42:02 - 42:07)
scarlet and violet I have yet to use any (42:04 - 42:10)
Urban mystica to actually shiny hunt (42:07 - 42:12)
really because I&#39;m a real shiny Hunter I (42:10 - 42:14)
don&#39;t want to have the increased chances (42:12 - 42:15)
no I&#39;m just kidding (42:14 - 42:19)
um I just I just haven&#39;t I haven&#39;t used (42:15 - 42:22)
any of urban mystica because I I do (42:19 - 42:26)
typically um I do typically do the (42:22 - 42:28)
method of just I get the m out breaks (42:26 - 42:29)
down (42:28 - 42:31)
to uh typically in between those two (42:29 - 42:33)
messages but I think the best way to (42:31 - 42:34)
just solidify it is if you get it down (42:33 - 42:37)
to that last that third message right (42:34 - 42:40)
and then just set up picnic and restart (42:37 - 42:42)
and honestly I&#39;ve been pretty I guess (42:40 - 42:44)
maybe just been pretty lucky with how (42:42 - 42:46)
often the shiny does pop up fairly (42:44 - 42:51)
quickly when doing that uh but I yeah I (42:46 - 42:53)
and then on top of that they&#39;ve had a (42:51 - 42:57)
few events where the shiny are boosted (42:53 - 42:59)
the shin is boosted and it&#39;s not even (42:57 - 43:01)
worth making a sandwich for some for (42:59 - 43:05)
those sometimes so that has been um My (43:01 - 43:08)
Method so far so I actually have some (43:05 - 43:10)
urb Mystic all saved up because I just (43:08 - 43:14)
go into it without actually uh making a (43:10 - 43:16)
sandwich you&#39;re going to be that guy (43:14 - 43:18)
Bobby that has like 40 Urban mystica the (43:16 - 43:19)
new game&#39;s going to come out and you (43:18 - 43:24)
haven&#39;t used any yeah yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s (43:19 - 43:26)
what happened with uh Ultra Sun Ultra (43:24 - 43:29)
Moon I have whatever currency that just (43:26 - 43:30)
didn&#39;t move with that it&#39;s all just (43:29 - 43:32)
sitting there and I have like nothing to (43:30 - 43:35)
use it on at this point (43:32 - 43:35)
so um the one thing that they didn&#39;t (43:38 - 43:43)
mention in this article (43:41 - 43:46)
that is not surprising (43:43 - 43:50)
and is that the I guess people maybe (43:46 - 43:52)
don&#39;t know this if you may maybe if (43:50 - 43:53)
you&#39;re listening to a Pokemon podcast (43:52 - 43:56)
you probably do know this but um the (43:53 - 43:58)
when the outbreak is starting to down (43:56 - 43:59)
outbreak is definitely getting lower not (43:58 - 44:01)
many Pokemon from the original outbreak (43:59 - 44:05)
those are not like at set intervals (44:01 - 44:07)
they&#39;re they&#39;re like kind of they&#39;re (44:05 - 44:11)
like slightly randomized so what (44:07 - 44:16)
Anubis said is that your shiny chance (44:11 - 44:20)
goes up at 30 and then it goes up again (44:16 - 44:24)
at 60 so you can get plus two to your um (44:20 - 44:26)
chant which is the same as a shiny charm (44:24 - 44:28)
so you know if you don&#39;t have the shiny (44:26 - 44:30)
charm and you knock out 60 technically (44:28 - 44:33)
the shiny charm is now on for you but if (44:30 - 44:34)
you do have the shiny charm instead of (44:33 - 44:36)
being a plus two it&#39;ll be a plus4 and (44:34 - 44:39)
then if you have the sparkling power (44:36 - 44:40)
that&#39;s I don&#39;t even know what that is a (44:39 - 44:43)
plus three or something another plus two (44:40 - 44:43)
I can&#39;t (44:43 - 44:47)
remember um so that that all goes in (44:43 - 44:49)
effect of like making increasing your (44:47 - 44:52)
chance for a Shiny Pokemon but if you (44:49 - 44:53)
actually (44:52 - 44:55)
count and you&#39;re looking for the the (44:53 - 44:57)
message to pop up like the outbreak is (44:55 - 44:59)
definitely starting to go down I&#39;ve had (44:57 - 45:01)
that appear (44:59 - 45:05)
at um like 25 I&#39;ve had it appear at like (45:01 - 45:07)
26 I&#39;ve had it appear at 27 it doesn&#39;t (45:05 - 45:10)
always appear exactly at like 25 (45:07 - 45:15)
Knockouts so it it is slightly (45:10 - 45:19)
randomized of when it appears so from my (45:15 - 45:21)
understanding it was (45:19 - 45:24)
never worth trusting those (45:21 - 45:26)
messages because like if you got like (45:24 - 45:28)
not many left from the original outbreak (45:26 - 45:29)
you might be at (45:28 - 45:32)
58 I&#39;m and like technically you haven&#39;t (45:29 - 45:36)
that the not many left comes after 60 (45:32 - 45:38)
regardless just the third message does (45:36 - 45:40)
which is yeah the third message does (45:38 - 45:42)
come which the outbreak definitely (45:40 - 45:45)
getting lower would be the yeah is the (45:42 - 45:47)
but if you&#39;re waiting for the third (45:45 - 45:49)
message I think you&#39;re good yes but you (45:47 - 45:51)
will have more Pokemon in the outbreak (45:49 - 45:54)
left to potentially be shiny if you&#39;re (45:51 - 45:57)
counting right so yeah cuz at a certain (45:54 - 45:59)
point outbreak feels like it gets (45:57 - 46:05)
thinner mhm so 60 is between the two the (45:59 - 46:06)
last two messages you&#39;re going to you&#39;re (46:05 - 46:08)
going to get the first message before 60 (46:06 - 46:10)
but you&#39;re going to get the last message (46:08 - 46:13)
after 60 so in this article they&#39;re (46:10 - 46:14)
saying you know the last message (46:13 - 46:16)
solidifies that you&#39;ve at least knocked (46:14 - 46:18)
out 60 but it&#39;s not saying that the (46:16 - 46:22)
message is at 60 so well maybe maybe I (46:18 - 46:24)
do like that method better cuz I hate (46:22 - 46:27)
counting I also hate paying attention (46:24 - 46:28)
and watching for the messages even more (46:27 - 46:30)
because if I&#39;m looking away in the very (46:28 - 46:32)
moment that the message comes up and I (46:30 - 46:34)
totally miss it then counting is more (46:32 - 46:37)
reliable so right but I&#39;m counting and (46:34 - 46:39)
then I then I get distracted with (46:37 - 46:40)
something and then I&#39;m like ah where did (46:39 - 46:42)
I leave off was it 20 or 22 the problem (46:40 - 46:44)
with counting to is that you it has to (46:42 - 46:46)
be the Pokemon from the mass outbreak so (46:44 - 46:48)
if you happen to be in a place where (46:46 - 46:50)
like that Pokemon also just (46:48 - 46:52)
spawns that spawned Pokemon that isn&#39;t (46:50 - 46:55)
part of the mass outbreak won&#39;t count so (46:52 - 46:58)
it&#39;s just you know the message is is (46:55 - 46:59)
what solidifies it the thing for me is (46:58 - 47:01)
that by the time you get to that third (46:59 - 47:03)
message the mass outbreak has thinned (47:01 - 47:07)
out like considerably more than when (47:03 - 47:09)
you&#39;re in between the two messages and (47:07 - 47:10)
so then when you&#39;re resetting you&#39;re (47:09 - 47:13)
resetting and only seeing four or five (47:10 - 47:16)
or six or whatever Pokemon versus like (47:13 - 47:17)
before the message you might have 12 or (47:16 - 47:20)
13 popping up and so but then you don&#39;t (47:17 - 47:21)
know when you&#39;ve actually if you&#39;re not (47:20 - 47:22)
counting you don&#39;t know when you&#39;ve (47:21 - 47:23)
actually hit that 60 Mark so you don&#39;t (47:22 - 47:26)
exactly know when you&#39;re over it or not (47:23 - 47:28)
yeah see I had thought that the messages (47:26 - 47:30)
did come at a set time like at a set (47:28 - 47:32)
number of Pokemon you had knocked out (47:30 - 47:35)
and I thought that maybe there was uh 15 (47:32 - 47:37)
Pokemon after the second message or (47:35 - 47:39)
something like that is when you get to (47:37 - 47:41)
60 that the messages can kind of help (47:39 - 47:43)
reset your counter because they do come (47:41 - 47:45)
at a set time but if you&#39;re certain they (47:43 - 47:48)
don&#39;t then maybe not well the the (47:45 - 47:52)
outbreaks are not the same (47:48 - 47:55)
number uh so when an outbreak spawns in (47:52 - 47:56)
it&#39;s not (47:55 - 47:59)
like Like A watral outbreak isn&#39;t like a (47:56 - 48:01)
100 Pokemon and then like a well A (47:59 - 48:03)
watral outbreak could be 100 Pokemon but (48:01 - 48:06)
then a tin ofon outbreak could be 120 (48:03 - 48:09)
Pokemon so like the the actual outbreak (48:06 - 48:11)
itself is not like a set number of (48:09 - 48:12)
Pokemon every time they have like a (48:11 - 48:15)
range where they can be in um and then (48:12 - 48:18)
the messages are probably a percentage (48:15 - 48:19)
there&#39;s no way no out percentage of that (48:18 - 48:21)
none of the outbreaks have that many (48:19 - 48:22)
Pokemon though for sure right there&#39;s no (48:21 - 48:24)
way there&#39;s like 60 Pokemon left once (48:22 - 48:26)
that third message pops up or whatever (48:24 - 48:30)
it&#39;s like yeah or five or seven or (48:26 - 48:34)
something but what I was doing for when (48:30 - 48:37)
when milser and F Bay were up I was only (48:34 - 48:40)
going to 30 I was like I&#39;m not going to (48:37 - 48:42)
reach twitch chat no one distract me I&#39;m (48:40 - 48:44)
going to do exactly 30 because I know at (48:42 - 48:47)
30 you get the Plus One MH and they were (48:44 - 48:49)
already boosted both of those Pokemon (48:47 - 48:51)
are already boosted and I had shiny (48:49 - 48:53)
charm and then I used sparkling power (48:51 - 48:55)
but I used sparkling power with humongo (48:53 - 48:58)
so they were easier to see um and I felt (48:55 - 49:03)
like I got way more shinies doing that (48:58 - 49:05)
most I it I will say it felt like (49:03 - 49:09)
Placebo uh but I but part of it was I do (49:05 - 49:12)
feel like they thin out to the point (49:09 - 49:14)
where you&#39;re seeing (49:12 - 49:17)
less when you get up to like that 60 oh (49:14 - 49:19)
yeah and like when you first get there (49:17 - 49:21)
it feels like there&#39;s so (49:19 - 49:23)
many so I was like well if I&#39;m only (49:21 - 49:24)
going to plus one and everything else is (49:23 - 49:27)
boosted I&#39;m still seeing so many (49:24 - 49:31)
versus adding another plus one but then (49:27 - 49:33)
seeing like half the amount yeah I&#39;m (49:31 - 49:36)
seeing that makes sense I would always (49:33 - 49:39)
position two that are next to each other (49:36 - 49:40)
so I would like just bike between the (49:39 - 49:43)
two cuz they would refresh and then it (49:40 - 49:46)
just felt like I was just seeing so many (49:43 - 49:46)
and people were like why aren&#39;t you (49:46 - 49:48)
going to 60 and I was like look at how (49:46 - 49:51)
many there are I&#39;m at a plus one (49:48 - 49:53)
like we&#39;re (49:51 - 49:55)
good but again maybe that was just (49:53 - 49:58)
Placebo for me no that makes sense yeah (49:55 - 50:00)
just mathematically that does make sense (49:58 - 50:02)
I mean you have to find that like (50:00 - 50:05)
balance where you have so many more but (50:02 - 50:09)
with lower odds versus like how cuz like (50:05 - 50:10)
I said sometimes you get up to that 60 (50:09 - 50:12)
or you don&#39;t know like you unless you&#39;re (50:10 - 50:14)
like really counting and then don&#39;t miss (50:12 - 50:16)
any or anything you know sometimes all (50:14 - 50:18)
of a sudden you realize like oh well now (50:16 - 50:21)
there&#39;s only like six and so I&#39;m (50:18 - 50:23)
resetting and it&#39;s like there are six (50:21 - 50:26)
you know and it&#39;s and so slow and it&#39;s (50:23 - 50:28)
just going away from the the outbreak (50:26 - 50:30)
and going back to the outbreak over and (50:28 - 50:33)
over and over again mhm yeah yeah I (50:30 - 50:35)
think Legends had that as well though (50:33 - 50:38)
where like Legends had um what were they (50:35 - 50:41)
called in Legends the not the (50:38 - 50:44)
hordes I wasn&#39;t a legend (50:41 - 50:46)
Hunter were were they also called (50:44 - 50:47)
outbreaks in Legends but like some (50:46 - 50:50)
outbreaks felt like in Legends they (50:47 - 50:52)
would they would disappear way quicker (50:50 - 50:54)
than other outbreaks yeah yeah of like (50:52 - 50:56)
oh I only knocked out 16 and now it&#39;s (50:54 - 50:58)
like already over where it&#39;s like oh I (50:56 - 51:00)
knocked out 25 and there&#39;s still a ton (50:58 - 51:01)
left and yeah they were outbreaks (51:00 - 51:03)
because there were the massive mass (51:01 - 51:04)
outbreaks that (51:03 - 51:09)
broke but they yeah the Legends was (51:04 - 51:11)
interesting cuz sometimes you would (51:09 - 51:14)
knock out the it was called something (51:11 - 51:15)
though like the batch of them in the (51:14 - 51:17)
outbreak was called something because (51:15 - 51:19)
then it would say like a new it wasn&#39;t a (51:17 - 51:20)
new outbreak it was a new something has (51:19 - 51:22)
formed and then you&#39;d have like six more (51:20 - 51:23)
that would pop up once you&#39;ve knocked (51:22 - 51:25)
out all of them you get like a second (51:23 - 51:28)
stage of whatever it was (51:25 - 51:30)
called the real Pokemon fans remember (51:28 - 51:33)
the black and white (51:30 - 51:33)
outbreaks that&#39;s the real thing it was (51:34 - 51:36)
it (51:36 - 51:40)
[Laughter] (51:36 - 51:42)
was I don&#39;t think the the black and (51:40 - 51:45)
white ones did not have increas sh yet (51:42 - 51:49)
no they definitely did (51:45 - 51:49)
not uh uh (51:49 - 51:56)
they released a sevenstar raid (51:53 - 51:58)
immediately after we started recording (51:56 - 52:01)
last week classic uh they ended up going (51:58 - 52:03)
with Meganium (52:01 - 52:05)
which uh makes sense that they would not (52:03 - 52:08)
do primarina septile next because you (52:05 - 52:10)
don&#39;t want you have when you&#39;re (52:08 - 52:12)
announcing something on April 1st you (52:10 - 52:14)
got to look at who&#39;s the biggest joke in (52:12 - 52:18)
the Pokedex megia this makes sense no oh (52:14 - 52:23)
no oh no no the megia made sense of we (52:18 - 52:26)
uh because uh cherry (52:23 - 52:27)
blossoms (52:26 - 52:29)
it was it was a cherry blossom week and (52:27 - 52:31)
it&#39;s the big dinosaur with a giant pink (52:29 - 52:33)
flower around (52:31 - 52:37)
it I guess that Mak sense sure I I&#39;ll go (52:33 - 52:39)
with (52:37 - 52:42)
that and it was April 1 gotta you (52:39 - 52:44)
gota (52:42 - 52:48)
they I can only take what I see online (52:44 - 52:51)
whether that&#39;s YouTube Twitter twitch (52:48 - 52:54)
Reddit our slack Community our Discord (52:51 - 52:57)
Etc and (52:54 - 52:59)
it seems (52:57 - 53:02)
that when people don&#39;t want to grind out (52:59 - 53:04)
a (53:02 - 53:07)
raid or when a YouTube video does better (53:04 - 53:10)
than past YouTube videos to me that (53:07 - 53:13)
those two signs and those three signs (53:10 - 53:16)
what people say a YouTube video doing (53:13 - 53:18)
significantly better than past and that (53:16 - 53:20)
people not want to grind it out it seems (53:18 - 53:25)
that people were not having fun with (53:20 - 53:28)
Meganium I mean your first video wasn&#39;t (53:25 - 53:32)
even uh approaching it you you guessed (53:28 - 53:35)
wrong I did yeah yeah yeah well I was I (53:32 - 53:38)
was right about the screens yeah which I (53:35 - 53:40)
built teams that were to deal with the (53:38 - 53:45)
screens um but I did not think a grass (53:40 - 53:47)
psychic focused (53:45 - 53:50)
Pokemon would be dominant with a (53:47 - 53:51)
fighting type (53:50 - 53:55)
move I I I think a lot of people would (53:51 - 53:57)
argue that a body press Pokemon would (53:55 - 54:00)
have been maybe saved for a different (53:57 - 54:04)
gimmick and yet this is what they did (54:00 - 54:05)
you probably weren&#39;t the only one who (54:04 - 54:10)
guessed wrong April 1 April 1 uh I I (54:05 - 54:15)
liked this raid um obviously I I went (54:10 - 54:16)
all in on like dark (54:15 - 54:19)
Pokemon because the only fighting type (54:16 - 54:22)
move it would have gotten was body press (54:19 - 54:27)
and boy did they did they I (54:22 - 54:29)
this is like the fourth Pokemon that has (54:27 - 54:31)
done that which is also kind of shocking (54:29 - 54:33)
or maybe they decided to lean into this (54:31 - 54:36)
but the first Pokemon that that&#39;s that&#39;s (54:33 - 54:38)
not 100% true there&#39;s there&#39;s like a (54:36 - 54:40)
there&#39;s like a five star Dragonite or a (54:38 - 54:42)
six-star Dragonite I can&#39;t remember that (54:40 - 54:44)
will that will go to like Max stats (54:42 - 54:47)
pretty quickly um but I (54:44 - 54:51)
think a lot of people&#39;s (54:47 - 54:53)
first uh what&#39;s the word a lot of (54:51 - 54:54)
people&#39;s first experience with that was (54:53 - 54:57)
Mewtwo where Mewtwo would bring it up (54:54 - 55:01)
very quickly and I have no problem with (54:57 - 55:03)
that like I think that&#39;s fine they (55:01 - 55:06)
already have like eight moves you know (55:03 - 55:09)
whatever right I my problem with that (55:06 - 55:12)
isn&#39;t it&#39;s my problem with that is (55:09 - 55:15)
there&#39;s no communication for (55:12 - 55:18)
that so if you don&#39;t know to check with (55:15 - 55:20)
the Y (55:18 - 55:23)
button and go in you would be like why (55:20 - 55:26)
did this get so strong or why am I doing (55:23 - 55:27)
so little damage I do think it&#39;s (55:26 - 55:30)
frustrating to a player to like it it&#39;ll (55:27 - 55:33)
show like oh it used bulk up or it used (55:30 - 55:36)
Amia or it used call mind or (55:33 - 55:38)
whatever and in a normal gameplay (55:36 - 55:39)
setting you&#39;re like okay cool it&#39;s it&#39;s (55:38 - 55:41)
like it&#39;s used call mind twice it&#39;s a (55:39 - 55:44)
plus two okay I got a like lunge twice (55:41 - 55:47)
or whatever or chilling water or (55:44 - 55:50)
snarl but if you don&#39;t check it&#39;s like (55:47 - 55:53)
oh it&#39;s plus six M yeah that&#39;s not what (55:50 - 55:56)
you expect you you approach that so (55:53 - 55:59)
different certainly if even in like a (55:56 - 56:01)
standard competitive match if if (55:59 - 56:03)
something&#39;s uh neutral versus something (56:01 - 56:06)
a plus two you just change your approach (56:03 - 56:08)
of like oh it&#39;s plus two now like that&#39;s (56:06 - 56:10)
scary I got to do something different (56:08 - 56:12)
when you&#39;re going from zero to plus six (56:10 - 56:14)
which doesn&#39;t happen in normal gamepl (56:12 - 56:17)
you would change your approach so you (56:14 - 56:19)
eventually like after you get like (56:17 - 56:21)
Smoked by it you&#39;re like oh I didn&#39;t but (56:19 - 56:23)
even then like let&#39;s say you just get (56:21 - 56:24)
smoked by it but you never thought to (56:23 - 56:25)
press the Y button you&#39;re probably like (56:24 - 56:27)
oh maybe I brought the wrong Pokemon or (56:25 - 56:28)
something went wrong or like I don&#39;t (56:27 - 56:29)
know what my teammates are doing because (56:28 - 56:31)
like this game is really bad at (56:29 - 56:34)
communicating so again I have no problem (56:31 - 56:36)
with going to plus six I just think like (56:34 - 56:39)
the game should clearly communicate (56:36 - 56:42)
because that&#39;s an important thing in a (56:39 - 56:47)
Pokemon situation to like (56:42 - 56:47)
communicate so again when I went into (56:48 - 56:53)
Meganium and I was like oh cool it used (56:50 - 56:55)
body press or Not body press it used (56:53 - 56:57)
curse (56:55 - 56:59)
I&#39;m like okay cool well uh we (56:57 - 57:02)
intimidated twice it cursed so it should (56:59 - 57:06)
be at1 because now it&#39;s plus one for (57:02 - 57:07)
attack and you&#39;re like you&#39;re you&#39;re (57:06 - 57:09)
like trying to do your math in math in (57:07 - 57:12)
the on the spot and then when you get (57:09 - 57:14)
one shot you&#39;re like what happened hold (57:12 - 57:18)
on yeah I calculated for this (57:14 - 57:22)
beforehand that shouldn&#39;t have happened (57:18 - 57:27)
um so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s fine like (57:22 - 57:28)
we saw a move (57:27 - 57:33)
set made made five six new Pokemon and (57:28 - 57:36)
they all work great (57:33 - 57:38)
um and that&#39;s that&#39;s cool I think like I (57:36 - 57:42)
love the building part of the (57:38 - 57:44)
raids and I think a lot of people like (57:42 - 57:46)
building part you see a lot of people (57:44 - 57:47)
even before they get into competitive (57:46 - 57:49)
they spend weeks building a team and (57:47 - 57:51)
they love that and then they get to the (57:49 - 57:52)
competitive part and they get smoked and (57:51 - 57:54)
then they&#39;re like ah I spent all this (57:52 - 57:57)
work but I do genuinely enjoy the work (57:54 - 58:00)
of like thinking theory crafting I mean (57:57 - 58:02)
like this is not exclusive to Pokemon (58:00 - 58:03)
right you see so many like sports (58:02 - 58:05)
commentators or or whatnot like they (58:03 - 58:07)
speculate or like this is what could (58:05 - 58:09)
happen this is what will happen like (58:07 - 58:11)
it&#39;s just human nature to be (58:09 - 58:14)
like how can we plan around a a scenario (58:11 - 58:17)
that hasn&#39;t existed yet it&#39;s fun um and (58:14 - 58:19)
then sometimes it it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t (58:17 - 58:22)
work but I I do I do think there is like (58:19 - 58:24)
a a level of balance of like same thing (58:22 - 58:27)
with Mewtwo is it too hard is it it too (58:24 - 58:30)
easy what is considered easy what is (58:27 - 58:32)
considered (58:30 - 58:32)
hard I think the biggest obstacle isn&#39;t (58:32 - 58:37)
actually the raid itself it&#39;s always (58:35 - 58:39)
been the people standing next to you (58:37 - 58:42)
yeah that continues to be a thing yeah (58:39 - 58:44)
definitely I will say as someone who (58:42 - 58:46)
doesn&#39;t play competitive the raids have (58:44 - 58:50)
been a nice way to build Pokemon like (58:46 - 58:52)
because I do like that but I don&#39;t play (58:50 - 58:54)
competitive so I&#39;m not building teams (58:52 - 58:56)
for competitive play and those brought (58:54 - 59:00)
out another reason to put a team or not (58:56 - 59:01)
put like put Pokemon together build a (59:00 - 59:03)
Pokemon and then you know few months (59:01 - 59:05)
down the line you realize oh now I have (59:03 - 59:07)
like all these Pokemon powered up I have (59:05 - 59:09)
these strong Pokemon that before I would (59:07 - 59:11)
have just had all this as as I do I (59:09 - 59:13)
would have just been hoarding all these (59:11 - 59:15)
items and not knowing what to really do (59:13 - 59:18)
with it because like story mode has been (59:15 - 59:19)
beaten and I don&#39;t have and then all of (59:18 - 59:21)
a sudden there&#39;s you have all this stuff (59:19 - 59:22)
and you&#39;re like I don&#39;t know really what (59:21 - 59:24)
to use it on or where to put it but then (59:22 - 59:26)
this gives like some direction of oh (59:24 - 59:28)
I&#39;ll power this up this week I&#39;ll power (59:26 - 59:30)
that up I&#39;ll do that and then six months (59:28 - 59:32)
on the line you&#39;re like oh great I have (59:30 - 59:34)
all these have all these powerful (59:32 - 59:35)
Pokemon that I can like switch between (59:34 - 59:38)
or or use in some way especially in a (59:35 - 59:40)
game where it&#39;s so easy to build a (59:38 - 59:42)
Pokemon compared to previous Pokemon (59:40 - 59:45)
games as I have been building Pokemon in (59:42 - 59:50)
X and Y and in ORS and in alola it&#39;s so (59:45 - 59:54)
much easier in scarlet and (59:50 - 59:59)
violet absolutely oh yeah the days of (59:54 - 60:02)
breeding breeding six I poke or doing (59:59 - 60:04)
the best to breed 6 I Pokemon and you (60:02 - 60:05)
know breeding like all you know doing (60:04 - 60:07)
all the the egg hatching and everything (60:05 - 60:10)
to get that one that&#39;s there and now (60:07 - 60:13)
it&#39;s those days are mostly gone yeah (60:10 - 60:16)
absolutely unless you need zero ID zero (60:13 - 60:19)
IV in one particular stat yeah they (60:16 - 60:21)
never they&#39;ve never given us that (60:19 - 60:23)
they&#39;ve never made that easier they did (60:21 - 60:25)
have the ditto event they had a ditto (60:23 - 60:27)
event in scarlet and violet early on (60:25 - 60:29)
that had yeah they did two particular (60:27 - 60:31)
ditto with zero IVs in the stat you (60:29 - 60:34)
would want for different strategies so (60:31 - 60:35)
they made that a little easier if you (60:34 - 60:38)
were playing right when that happened (60:35 - 60:39)
right yeah that was the only time they (60:38 - 60:41)
only did it once though didn&#39;t they yeah (60:39 - 60:44)
yeah that was that was very early on if (60:41 - 60:45)
I remember correctly it was pretty early (60:44 - 60:48)
on too yeah that was before I understood (60:45 - 60:50)
raids for (60:48 - 60:52)
sure (60:50 - 60:54)
yeah yeah (60:52 - 60:59)
I look at my boxes in scarlet and violet (60:54 - 61:03)
and I think wow I have over 60 level 100 (60:59 - 61:06)
fully built Pokemon specifically just (61:03 - 61:09)
for raids and it&#39;s really cool like I (61:06 - 61:11)
can go back to X and (61:09 - 61:13)
Y and (61:11 - 61:16)
just nothing is level 100 nothing is (61:13 - 61:18)
eveve trained the things that are eveve (61:16 - 61:20)
trained are eveve trained because I went (61:18 - 61:22)
through the story and so the EES are (61:20 - 61:23)
like all over the place they&#39;re not (61:22 - 61:26)
really e trained they&#39;re just e maxed (61:23 - 61:30)
yeah they just have (61:26 - 61:34)
EES so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really cool to (61:30 - 61:37)
have all of these level 100 all of these (61:34 - 61:39)
eeve trained all of these bottle capped (61:37 - 61:43)
Pokemon that like served the purpose and (61:39 - 61:45)
it is also cool to see people get (61:43 - 61:47)
excited (61:45 - 61:50)
that they can use different Pokemon (61:47 - 61:52)
right there there might be there for (61:50 - 61:55)
sure is players that they built like (61:52 - 61:58)
three things they got like a maridon an (61:55 - 62:00)
iron hands and (61:58 - 62:02)
ayate and which one of these three will (62:00 - 62:04)
work for the Seven Star raid boss (62:02 - 62:07)
because I don&#39;t want to build another um (62:04 - 62:09)
but then there are people who play the (62:07 - 62:11)
game every day or a couple times a week (62:09 - 62:13)
or have been (62:11 - 62:16)
playing and when a raid comes out it&#39;s (62:13 - 62:20)
like cool what can I make this week MH (62:16 - 62:22)
like what I have all these (62:20 - 62:25)
resources oh I get to use a skele dirch (62:22 - 62:27)
for the first time or oh I get to use a (62:25 - 62:28)
cable for the first time like that&#39;s so (62:27 - 62:31)
cool I haven&#39;t used that yet uh and then (62:28 - 62:33)
you you really learn more about a (62:31 - 62:38)
specific Pokemon right like I have never (62:33 - 62:40)
really looked at clef A&#39;s move set I I (62:38 - 62:42)
don&#39;t know what it can learn or what it (62:40 - 62:45)
can&#39;t learn or um what its stat (62:42 - 62:48)
distribution is uh (62:45 - 62:52)
so I I still love Seven Star raids I (62:48 - 62:54)
still think they&#39;re so fun to prep for (62:52 - 62:58)
and to actually do and to they&#39;re just (62:54 - 63:01)
the playing with other people for me is (62:58 - 63:04)
just scratches a specific itch mhm uh (63:01 - 63:06)
that other games were scratching before (63:04 - 63:09)
I stopped playing those other games (63:06 - 63:14)
looking at you Final Fantasy 14 (63:09 - 63:14)
um but I the Seven Star raids get so (63:14 - 63:21)
held back from just the performance of (63:18 - 63:25)
scarlet and violet like they&#39;re still (63:21 - 63:27)
super laggy there was two Meganium raids (63:25 - 63:30)
where I joined and we just sat there (63:27 - 63:32)
looking at Meganium as the music played (63:30 - 63:34)
there was no timer there was no HP bar (63:32 - 63:36)
we&#39;re just (63:34 - 63:39)
like do we wait this out do we do we (63:36 - 63:40)
force (63:39 - 63:44)
quit what&#39;s happening did you wait it (63:40 - 63:46)
out well I waited probably six seven (63:44 - 63:49)
minutes and nothing happened it just the (63:46 - 63:51)
timer didn&#39;t even appear it just there (63:49 - 63:53)
was no yeah yeah wouldn&#39;t have given it (63:51 - 63:56)
that much time six or seven minutes of (63:53 - 63:57)
just waiting you&#39;re sit there (63:56 - 63:58)
chitchatting with (63:57 - 64:04)
people true maybe it&#39;ll start maybe it (63:58 - 64:04)
won&#39;t who (64:04 - 64:09)
knows yeah yeah the lack of stability in (64:06 - 64:12)
the raids and the lack of kind of gu (64:09 - 64:13)
lines that means people are still (64:12 - 64:17)
bringing in Pokemon that aren&#39;t level (64:13 - 64:17)
100h (64:18 - 64:23)
really back you know if if again we say (64:19 - 64:25)
this all the time but if if you were (64:23 - 64:27)
playing with random and you see somebody (64:25 - 64:29)
lock in a 75 (64:27 - 64:32)
Lucario you would probably be like you (64:29 - 64:33)
I&#39;m going to sit this right out good (64:32 - 64:35)
luck you can&#39;t you can&#39;t even see that (64:33 - 64:37)
you can&#39;t see the level until you enter (64:35 - 64:41)
the ring and at that point it&#39;s just we (64:37 - 64:43)
lost there&#39;s nothing we can do to win (64:41 - 64:45)
yeah well that&#39;s the unfortunate thing (64:43 - 64:48)
about I mean that kind of makes me uh (64:45 - 64:51)
think of go a little bit and you know (64:48 - 64:54)
when you go to a raid and you get to the (64:51 - 64:55)
you know raid and you hop in and then (64:54 - 64:56)
you (64:55 - 64:59)
see a bunch of people who are like level (64:56 - 65:00)
I mean this doesn&#39;t happen as much (64:59 - 65:01)
anymore but you see a bunch of people (65:00 - 65:02)
who are like level 20 or something or (65:01 - 65:04)
you see you know you&#39;re in there with (65:02 - 65:06)
like three people and it&#39;s a Lugia or (65:04 - 65:08)
something and there&#39;re everyone&#39;s level (65:06 - 65:10)
20 and you&#39;re level 40 and you&#39;re like (65:08 - 65:12)
okay this isn&#39;t going to work like this (65:10 - 65:14)
just it&#39;s like I would love to raid with (65:12 - 65:17)
you but this we&#39;re not going to win but (65:14 - 65:18)
you can see the levels there before the (65:17 - 65:21)
raid starts and you can out before your (65:18 - 65:22)
pass is that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying so then (65:21 - 65:23)
what ends up well so this is what I was (65:22 - 65:25)
going to get into so then what happens (65:23 - 65:27)
is you jump out and then the people that (65:25 - 65:29)
want to raid but that don&#39;t understand (65:27 - 65:30)
like oh it&#39;s not going to win but (65:29 - 65:32)
they&#39;re like oh well this person like (65:30 - 65:33)
just jumped out is it because we&#39;re (65:32 - 65:35)
lower level is it whatever I feel like (65:33 - 65:37)
that doesn&#39;t happen in scarlet and (65:35 - 65:38)
violet because no one knows that before (65:37 - 65:41)
you go into the raid so even though you (65:38 - 65:44)
thought bring in the right Pokemon are (65:41 - 65:45)
aware what&#39;s going to happen the people (65:44 - 65:47)
that bring in the lower level probably (65:45 - 65:50)
are not yeah and because they probably (65:47 - 65:52)
also don&#39;t understand how the timer (65:50 - 65:54)
works and that their Pokemon fainting is (65:52 - 65:57)
the reason yeah you lose but they will (65:54 - 65:58)
understand if everyone if they can ever (65:57 - 66:00)
battle with anyone and if they&#39;re just (65:58 - 66:02)
like abandoned every time I don&#39;t know (66:00 - 66:04)
what&#39;s worse I don&#39;t know if going in (66:02 - 66:06)
and losing but at least playing with (66:04 - 66:08)
other people and joining into something (66:06 - 66:11)
is worse or if like you can&#39;t get a raid (66:08 - 66:13)
because you&#39;re too low level and (66:11 - 66:14)
everyone would be able to see that and (66:13 - 66:16)
then would leave before you&#39;d actually (66:14 - 66:18)
be able to go do a raid in the first (66:16 - 66:20)
place I think that making everyone lose (66:18 - 66:22)
raids over and over again is worse I (66:20 - 66:23)
just mean for the person who has the (66:22 - 66:25)
lower level Pokemon yeah then they will (66:23 - 66:28)
Lear and they will use experience candy (66:25 - 66:31)
and they&#39;ll go in with a better Pokemon (66:28 - 66:33)
maybe hopefully I you know I don&#39;t know (66:31 - 66:36)
cuz like it it&#39;s a good question and (66:33 - 66:38)
when I&#39;m on when I&#39;m on Twitch obviously (66:36 - 66:40)
I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to help as many people (66:38 - 66:41)
get through as possible and there are (66:40 - 66:43)
people that come through and they&#39;re (66:41 - 66:45)
like this is my first seven star rate (66:43 - 66:47)
I&#39;ve ever completed like thank you so (66:45 - 66:51)
much right uh and we had we had a person (66:47 - 66:53)
that came in they were like all I have (66:51 - 66:56)
is a maridon and I was like okay cool I (66:53 - 66:57)
was like is that at least level 100 and (66:56 - 67:01)
they were like yeah and we were able to (66:57 - 67:03)
like get the Maron through just fine (67:01 - 67:05)
right like they didn&#39;t they didn&#39;t they (67:03 - 67:08)
didn&#39;t have they had like they had like (67:05 - 67:09)
it was like literally like thunder (67:08 - 67:12)
parabolic charge electr drift and like (67:09 - 67:13)
Thunderbolt right it was like four (67:12 - 67:14)
electric type moves none of these are (67:13 - 67:18)
super effective against Meganium but and (67:14 - 67:20)
nor do you need four electric type (67:18 - 67:23)
attacks it like flashbacks to how I was (67:20 - 67:25)
like 10 years old battling the Elite 4 (67:23 - 67:27)
with blast through a water type elite (67:25 - 67:30)
four person then that&#39;ll be fine yeah (67:27 - 67:34)
like you you have this water type gym (67:30 - 67:37)
leader on lock with this Maron he won&#39;t (67:34 - 67:40)
get past you but there was like basic (67:37 - 67:42)
communication right uh and this was like (67:40 - 67:44)
the same thing in like Destiny or (67:42 - 67:45)
something where somebody&#39;s like I&#39;ve (67:44 - 67:46)
never done this before and it&#39;s like (67:45 - 67:48)
okay you&#39;re just going to stand right (67:46 - 67:50)
here you&#39;re going to watch this door (67:48 - 67:52)
that&#39;s all you got to do we&#39;ll handle (67:50 - 67:54)
everything else here&#39;s your one task (67:52 - 67:56)
just do this (67:54 - 67:59)
and so like that works because (67:56 - 68:01)
like you can just talk to that person (67:59 - 68:04)
and be like what&#39;s up and then we I I (68:01 - 68:07)
did another raid and like a a level 100 (68:04 - 68:11)
smeargle joined in and I I have like I (68:07 - 68:13)
have like the the damage calculator (68:11 - 68:15)
already up for Meganium right I have (68:13 - 68:18)
Meganium up I have like plus six attack (68:15 - 68:21)
plus six defense body press seed bomb (68:18 - 68:23)
whatever it whatever it was and so I (68:21 - 68:25)
quickly like just changed the Pokemon to (68:23 - 68:28)
smear and it&#39;s like body press (68:25 - 68:31)
270 damage to like 300 damage I&#39;m like (68:28 - 68:32)
hey (68:31 - 68:36)
smeargle you&#39;re obviously here like (68:32 - 68:38)
you&#39;re somewhere in chat there&#39;s 300 (68:36 - 68:40)
people you&#39;re one of them because you&#39;re (68:38 - 68:43)
looking at my screen to join this raid (68:40 - 68:45)
can you like tell me what your smeargle (68:43 - 68:47)
is like supposed to do like because (68:45 - 68:49)
smeargle could like roleplay right they (68:47 - 68:52)
could roll play skadge is unaware they (68:49 - 68:55)
could they could um smeargle can do a (68:52 - 68:57)
lot of things they can do a lot of (68:55 - 68:58)
things right I think they can like I (68:57 - 69:00)
think there&#39;s a move to like copy the (68:58 - 69:02)
other person&#39;s typing so it could like (69:00 - 69:04)
copy the skele to become like fire ghost (69:02 - 69:05)
like there&#39;s a lot of things that (69:04 - 69:07)
smeargle could do I was like cool (69:05 - 69:08)
smeargle like what are you what are you (69:07 - 69:11)
doing nothing I was like three minute (69:08 - 69:13)
timer here before the raid starts like (69:11 - 69:15)
smeargle I would like to like help you (69:13 - 69:17)
do this (69:15 - 69:20)
raid what is your move set nothing and (69:17 - 69:23)
then like I I was like I can&#39;t I can&#39;t (69:20 - 69:25)
there&#39;s other people that need help like (69:23 - 69:28)
going to start this raid and like hope (69:25 - 69:29)
you know what you&#39;re doing when you (69:28 - 69:31)
won&#39;t even like type in chat what your (69:29 - 69:35)
move set is like I like just tell me (69:31 - 69:38)
what you&#39;re trying to do and I can (69:35 - 69:39)
adjust or help you or like pick a (69:38 - 69:42)
different Pokemon right yeah (69:39 - 69:45)
like uh and there&#39;s no communication (69:42 - 69:47)
there so like I&#39;m sorry smeargle if (69:45 - 69:49)
you&#39;re listening I I couldn&#39;t I couldn&#39;t (69:47 - 69:52)
help you cuz just just need you to say (69:49 - 69:54)
something communication is important (69:52 - 69:57)
yeah but it seems to be the theme of the (69:54 - 70:01)
podcast communication is (69:57 - 70:01)
important so anyways (70:01 - 70:07)
uh there&#39;s five new builds from megani (70:04 - 70:09)
up up on YouTube and wherever I put the (70:07 - 70:13)
graphics uh the first day for (70:09 - 70:16)
Meganium we were completing it in like (70:13 - 70:19)
eight or nine minutes which isn&#39;t ideal (70:16 - 70:21)
because the raids only last 10 minutes (70:19 - 70:23)
before they fail uh the second builds we (70:21 - 70:25)
were getting it done in like three (70:23 - 70:26)
minutes (70:25 - 70:29)
they&#39;re super quick super efficient the (70:26 - 70:30)
first bills were wrong though right or (70:29 - 70:32)
the first bills were like not as (70:30 - 70:34)
effective towards it as you thought they (70:32 - 70:36)
were going to be um the first builds (70:34 - 70:40)
were the pivot of like okay let&#39;s build (70:36 - 70:42)
something else and then when I ended (70:40 - 70:44)
stream and I didn&#39;t have like 300 people (70:42 - 70:46)
asking me what they should build yeah I (70:44 - 70:48)
like tweaked the numbers a little bit (70:46 - 70:50)
and then put out the YouTube video with (70:48 - 70:52)
like the updated that makes sense I mean (70:50 - 70:54)
those builds were still winning though (70:52 - 70:56)
so yeah they were still like even even (70:54 - 70:57)
the first builds there were people that (70:56 - 70:59)
were like oh your incinerar build work (70:57 - 71:02)
great I was like (70:59 - 71:02)
okay like if it works it works if it (71:02 - 71:07)
works for you there are so many people (71:06 - 71:10)
that like only do it one time right (71:07 - 71:11)
they&#39;ll like they&#39;ll only do it once (71:10 - 71:13)
they they&#39;ll come in they&#39;ll be like oh (71:11 - 71:14)
man that was so easy and then like they (71:13 - 71:16)
never do it again and I always just (71:14 - 71:17)
think of (71:16 - 71:21)
like who in The Raid actually carried (71:17 - 71:24)
you for you to come in to be like it was (71:21 - 71:26)
easy like what is your definition of (71:24 - 71:28)
[Laughter] (71:26 - 71:32)
easy I don&#39;t know (71:28 - 71:36)
um I think my mouse died oh no oh no oh (71:32 - 71:37)
no here we go okay I was like I got (71:36 - 71:40)
flipped to the last article uh I think (71:37 - 71:42)
that&#39;s it for scarlet and violet that&#39;s (71:40 - 71:43)
all we had yeah how to catch shiny (71:42 - 71:44)

Beedrill I did like Beav is it B barel (73:05 - 73:10)

Pokemon I did you absolutely did because (73:18 - 73:24)
I was like what is (73:22 - 73:26)

I went to a concert last night I&#39;m very (73:26 - 73:33)
tired the Beedrill Cleaver mashup (73:30 - 73:36)
Pokemon we did not know we needed here&#39;s (73:33 - 73:39)
a collection (73:36 - 73:39)
challenge there&#39;s new Avatar items which (73:41 - 73:48)
they&#39;re nice Avatar items is this the (73:45 - 73:51)
first time they&#39;ve done new (73:48 - 73:54)
earrings they&#39;ve done a couple mhm I (73:51 - 73:57)
know there are had earrings right that (73:54 - 73:58)
would make sense I think (73:57 - 74:00)
so I (73:58 - 74:02)
don&#39;t you know a lot of things make (74:00 - 74:04)
sense but n kind of drops the ball (74:02 - 74:06)
[Laughter] (74:04 - 74:09)
regardless uh let&#39;s see I think where (74:06 - 74:12)
even are they are they in hats they&#39;re (74:09 - 74:15)
in oh are they yeah there are meltan (74:12 - 74:17)
earrings there are pearl earrings like (74:15 - 74:19)
the ones your buddy finds for you and I (74:17 - 74:22)
I think that&#39;s it there&#39;s meltan (74:19 - 74:26)
earrings there are yep are they cool (74:22 - 74:29)
I mean they look like melon like it&#39;s (74:26 - 74:32)
like it&#39;s head and eye oh I see what (74:29 - 74:35)
you&#39;re saying I guess that Mak sense I (74:32 - 74:37)
think that&#39;s it it looks like that&#39;s all (74:35 - 74:39)
the earrings up till this point when we (74:37 - 74:43)
are getting uh all of the Burmy (74:39 - 74:46)
earrings is it me or looking at this (74:43 - 74:49)
graphic the comi backpack and the (74:46 - 74:53)
earrings look really good they look like (74:49 - 74:55)
art they don&#39;t look like the actual (74:53 - 74:57)
model in game yeah they look like (74:55 - 75:00)
they&#39;re drawn on there but I guess the (74:57 - 75:02)
reason I point that out is that what (75:00 - 75:05)
they&#39;re supposed to look like with the (75:02 - 75:08)
new character graphical update wait let (75:05 - 75:10)
me see cuz I have the new character (75:08 - 75:12)
update I don&#39;t but the new character (75:10 - 75:13)
update looks (75:12 - 75:17)
terrible you don&#39;t even have it yet I&#39;ve (75:13 - 75:19)
seen pictures dep you don&#39;t even have it (75:17 - 75:22)
yet is it do you have it is it bad no I (75:19 - 75:25)
also don&#39;t have it yet I&#39;m waiting to (75:22 - 75:27)
have it judgment on it until I actually (75:25 - 75:29)
have the character update I was waiting (75:27 - 75:31)
to have a judgment on it too and then I (75:29 - 75:33)
saw Zoe post the side by side of her (75:31 - 75:36)
character before and after and I was (75:33 - 75:38)
instantly like unsold I was like I&#39;m I&#39;m (75:36 - 75:41)
not I&#39;m judging right now we&#39;re judging (75:38 - 75:43)
today as someone who has it this is what (75:41 - 75:45)
I&#39;ll say I have put a hat on and a mask (75:43 - 75:47)
on and I&#39;ve never worn a hat or a mask (75:45 - 75:50)
in the game before so I was like my (75:47 - 75:52)
character just looks better in this like (75:50 - 75:54)
I just found a I found stuff that made (75:52 - 75:56)
the thing look better I think overall (75:54 - 75:58)
it&#39;s the the whole idea of it the (75:56 - 76:00)
concept of it the all of that is very (75:58 - 76:02)
cool I like it I think there are some (76:00 - 76:04)
things they they could maybe tweak a (76:02 - 76:05)
little bit some things they could work (76:04 - 76:07)
out a little bit um and I do think they (76:05 - 76:10)
do need to add there&#39;s still a little (76:07 - 76:12)
bit more they should actually add to it (76:10 - 76:15)
um not all of it is some parts are full (76:12 - 76:17)
are more customizable than other parts (76:15 - 76:19)
and I think there could be something to (76:17 - 76:22)
maybe having a little more customization (76:19 - 76:27)
um on maybe more of the options like the (76:22 - 76:32)
facial features and hair um but it&#39;s the (76:27 - 76:34)
concept of it is very good but yeah I (76:32 - 76:36)
don&#39;t know I&#39;m looking at the zo&#39;s side (76:34 - 76:37)
by side right now and that&#39;s not even (76:36 - 76:38)
the same (76:37 - 76:41)
outfit those the items aren&#39;t the same (76:38 - 76:42)
items on her character that&#39;s going to (76:41 - 76:45)
make the character look worse I I was (76:42 - 76:47)
just mostly looking at like the face (76:45 - 76:50)
doesn&#39;t look great I don&#39;t know like (76:47 - 76:52)
Bobby said a mask might help I always (76:50 - 76:55)
have a mask on my character anyways so (76:52 - 76:57)
I&#39;m probably going to be fine with (76:55 - 77:02)
it it&#39;s just like there (76:57 - 77:05)
is there is like (77:02 - 77:07)
uh when you see the (77:05 - 77:11)
Pokemon go trainer you know that it&#39;s (77:07 - 77:14)
Pokemon go right cuz you&#39;re just so used (77:11 - 77:15)
to looking at it cuz it&#39;s been the same (77:14 - 77:17)
thing for eight years yeah totally (77:15 - 77:20)
totally and now that they&#39;re changing it (77:17 - 77:23)
which is fine like very happy that (77:20 - 77:25)
they&#39;re changing it adding more size is (77:23 - 77:26)
models (77:25 - 77:30)
Heights skin color although I heard that (77:26 - 77:32)
there should be more skin tone (77:30 - 77:35)
adjustments yeah you would just think (77:32 - 77:37)
that like it would be (77:35 - 77:40)
better and it doesn&#39;t seem I don&#39;t think (77:37 - 77:42)
it looks worse I just think it looks (77:40 - 77:45)
different it just looks like a different (77:42 - 77:48)
game I could imagine seeing this model (77:45 - 77:49)
in a different game and not being (77:48 - 77:51)
surprised that that exists and not (77:49 - 77:53)
thinking it looks (77:51 - 77:57)
horrible I think that that they on the (77:53 - 78:00)
um body style they definitely have um (77:57 - 78:02)
the like there&#39;s like five or six (78:00 - 78:03)
different options and then there is like (78:02 - 78:06)
a customize option and then in there (78:03 - 78:09)
there are sliders where you can change (78:06 - 78:12)
uh different things uh of it and then (78:09 - 78:14)
you can kind of do your own (78:12 - 78:16)
customization and obviously I know that (78:14 - 78:19)
that is a lot harder on other things (78:16 - 78:21)
like facial stuff but I feel like there (78:19 - 78:22)
if they could add something like that it (78:21 - 78:24)
would be a huge Improvement I know they (78:22 - 78:26)
do that in other games this is not like (78:24 - 78:27)
you know and I get this is like di (78:26 - 78:29)
Antics uh first time doing going and (78:27 - 78:31)
doing something like this in Pokemon go (78:29 - 78:34)
but I do think there would be benefits (78:31 - 78:36)
to I think it&#39;s a good start but I do (78:34 - 78:37)
think that it would be good to have a (78:36 - 78:39)
little bit more customization not saying (78:37 - 78:41)
that they&#39;re going to they probably like (78:39 - 78:42)
put it out like this and they&#39;re like (78:41 - 78:44)
this is it but also not everyone has it (78:42 - 78:47)
so clearly they&#39;re like looking at (78:44 - 78:48)
smaller groups have it and I&#39;m sure (78:47 - 78:50)
they&#39;re like looking at feedback from (78:48 - 78:51)
those smaller groups and just hearing (78:50 - 78:54)
what people have to say about it and (78:51 - 78:55)
maybe there&#39;ll be some difference is (78:54 - 78:57)
because even with like the encounter (78:55 - 78:59)
backgrounds just another thing that has (78:57 - 79:01)
a small test group having it right now a (78:59 - 79:03)
smaller group The Encounter backgrounds (79:01 - 79:05)
have been changing I&#39;ve had them for (79:03 - 79:07)
quite a bit and they have definitely (79:05 - 79:09)
changed and they have made tweaks and (79:07 - 79:12)
improvements to the encounter screens (79:09 - 79:16)
over the last two months so I mean they (79:12 - 79:18)
could still be making different a few (79:16 - 79:21)
different changes and things to this but (79:18 - 79:23)
um I think the concept is great I think (79:21 - 79:25)
there could be a few adjustments they (79:23 - 79:28)
could make but that&#39;s what I&#39;m the (79:25 - 79:31)
clothes like all your clothes come back (79:28 - 79:35)
right yeah yeah like it&#39;s not like oh (79:31 - 79:37)
you&#39;ve updated your character and now (79:35 - 79:39)
you can&#39;t have this access the clothes (79:37 - 79:41)
you bought you can definitely access the (79:39 - 79:43)
clothes you bought uh I believe when (79:41 - 79:46)
they change it it changes your like so (79:43 - 79:48)
the clothes that I&#39;ve saved like the (79:46 - 79:50)
outfits that I&#39;ve saved are no longer (79:48 - 79:52)
saved but the I can go back and pick (79:50 - 79:54)
them again if I&#39;ve purchased them or if (79:52 - 79:56)
they&#39;re free if they were free I can go (79:54 - 79:58)
back all that Stu again but it does seem (79:56 - 80:01)
like they took the saved stuff out so (79:58 - 80:04)
you do have to resave stuff resave (80:01 - 80:07)
outfits so my question is like are the (80:04 - 80:10)
clothes different or lay different or (80:07 - 80:12)
feel different in the sense of if I put (80:10 - 80:15)
on the baggy jeans with the chain wallet (80:12 - 80:17)
and then the hiking boots are they going (80:15 - 80:18)
to like clip through each other like (80:17 - 80:21)
they always do like no matter what body (80:18 - 80:24)
style you choose and stuff yeah or do (80:21 - 80:26)
they like like do the actually like lay (80:24 - 80:30)
properly I guess is the question um I (80:26 - 80:31)
mean I can only I&#39;m just going through (80:30 - 80:33)
the different like bodies that I&#39;m just (80:31 - 80:34)
clicking through the different body (80:33 - 80:36)
styles on what I have on no I would just (80:34 - 80:39)
be clicking like do the (80:36 - 80:41)
clothes BG jeans and then click through (80:39 - 80:44)
the shoes and see if they clip yeah I (80:41 - 80:47)
see what you&#39;re saying um because I (80:44 - 80:49)
think that was my biggest problem with (80:47 - 80:52)
the current models is and I gave Niantic (80:49 - 80:54)
this feedback directly cuz there was (80:52 - 80:55)
like at one point Niantic like pulled a (80:54 - 80:56)
bunch of people together and was like (80:55 - 80:58)
what would you like to see in clothing (80:56 - 81:02)
and that was like like a decade ago um (80:58 - 81:03)
that&#39;s not true that the game&#39;s not been (81:02 - 81:08)
out for a a long time ago though but uh (81:03 - 81:11)
I told I one of my feedback besides like (81:08 - 81:12)
you should have different sizes and (81:11 - 81:14)
different heights and different weights (81:12 - 81:15)
and like different skin colors and I (81:14 - 81:16)
should be able to wear any clothes I (81:15 - 81:20)
want um but one of the biggest gripes I (81:16 - 81:22)
had is like it sucks buying a pair of (81:20 - 81:25)
pants for like $3 and then it not works (81:22 - 81:26)
with your like favorite pair of shoes (81:25 - 81:28)
that you bought for like $2 like that (81:26 - 81:31)
just feels terrible like I actively want (81:28 - 81:34)
to like I want to give you money Niantic (81:31 - 81:35)
because I want my character to look a (81:34 - 81:37)
certain way and I just gave you $5 and (81:35 - 81:40)
the thing I bought like doesn&#39;t actually (81:37 - 81:42)
look good at all well I can tell you (81:40 - 81:45)
this just from a quick going through (81:42 - 81:47)
this so I&#39;m wearing like I have I just (81:45 - 81:50)
put on like a pair of the pants and then (81:47 - 81:53)
shoes like that are I don&#39;t even know (81:50 - 81:53)
what kinds of shoes these are but (81:53 - 81:55)
they&#39;re clipping through the pants (81:53 - 81:58)
and as I change the body style they&#39;re (81:55 - 81:59)
still clipping but like it&#39;s less and (81:58 - 82:02)
more depending on which body style I&#39;m (81:59 - 82:07)
using so it is changing what how it&#39;s (82:02 - 82:09)
actually acting um based on like body (82:07 - 82:11)
style that is changing but it&#39;s still (82:09 - 82:12)
like it still doesn&#39;t look good because (82:11 - 82:14)
it&#39;s still clipping through the it (82:12 - 82:18)
doesn&#39;t ever go away um but there are (82:14 - 82:19)
certain body styles where like there&#39;s (82:18 - 82:21)
more clipping happening and then there (82:19 - 82:27)
are certain where is less happening so (82:21 - 82:27)
so no they didn&#39;t F okay got it so the (82:27 - 82:32)
flipping still (82:30 - 82:35)
happens yeah so we got to the bottom of (82:32 - 82:39)
that case yeah uh again small groups (82:35 - 82:42)
seem to have this not everyone has it so (82:39 - 82:43)
I don&#39;t know I think there still could (82:42 - 82:47)
be um potentially some adjustments made (82:43 - 82:51)
but we&#39;ll have to wait and (82:47 - 82:51)
see all right um (82:52 - 82:57)
well (82:55 - 83:01)
Mega Heracross will be making its debut (82:57 - 83:05)
this weekend not to be confused with (83:01 - 83:05)
Beaver not to be confused with mega (83:07 - 83:12)
Beaver correct Mega Beaver not in the (83:09 - 83:17)
game yet no it it is if it&#39;s Beedrill it (83:12 - 83:20)
is it&#39;s been in the game the whole the (83:17 - 83:22)
whole time megas have (83:20 - 83:22)
existed hey oh I&#39;ll be at the Orlando (83:23 - 83:30)
regional tournament this (83:27 - 83:34)
weekend I&#39;ll be there Friday and (83:30 - 83:39)
Sunday uh Saturday I&#39;m going to Disney (83:34 - 83:42)
right if we have uh if you (83:39 - 83:46)
are going to Orlando regionals (83:42 - 83:46)
on Friday or Saturday um sorry Friday (83:47 - 83:53)
Saturday Sunday and you see me feel free (83:51 - 83:55)
to stop me and say hi (83:53 - 83:58)
um and if you&#39;re in the slack or the (83:55 - 84:00)
Discord I&#39;ll probably post maybe we&#39;ll (83:58 - 84:02)
do like a a Meetup like I said at the (84:00 - 84:04)
free part at Disney Disney Springs I (84:02 - 84:06)
think it&#39;s called on like Saturday or (84:04 - 84:10)
something but I&#39;ll be in the area and (84:06 - 84:13)
then there should be a Heracross raid (84:10 - 84:17)
hour I believe on Saturday right there&#39;s (84:13 - 84:20)
so there&#39;s it&#39;s three hour from 2:00 to (84:17 - 84:25)
5:00 local is the raid day so (84:20 - 84:28)
um and you can uh you can buy well (84:25 - 84:30)
there&#39;s like an event ticket obviously (84:28 - 84:33)
that if you want to I think it&#39;s $5 for (84:30 - 84:38)
that ticket or at least $5 um USD uh and (84:33 - 84:40)
then uh looks like you&#39;ll get some just (84:38 - 84:42)
like any other raid day you&#39;ll get um (84:40 - 84:44)
just for free you&#39;ll get up to five (84:42 - 84:46)
additional um raid passes for spinning (84:44 - 84:49)
disc photo discs uh and then you have an (84:46 - 84:52)
increased chance at encountering shiny (84:49 - 84:55)
Heracross so that usually like one and (84:52 - 84:58)
10 so yeah they usually like one and 10 (84:55 - 85:02)
so um I don&#39;t have one from when was it (84:58 - 85:04)
was at go fest last year where they had (85:02 - 85:07)
was they had Heracross spawning I did (85:04 - 85:09)
not get a shiny one then (85:07 - 85:11)
so U but yeah otherwise just a regular (85:09 - 85:13)
raid day are either of you excited for (85:11 - 85:16)
this one do you want to raid Heracross (85:13 - 85:19)
or yeah I like Heracross it&#39;s a new Mega (85:16 - 85:20)
so I&#39;m definitely going to be at least (85:19 - 85:24)
getting that yeah yeah for sure did we (85:20 - 85:25)
don&#39;t know how much energy it&#39;s going to (85:24 - 85:27)
cost or has that put sometimes they put (85:25 - 85:29)
that in the game early like they (85:27 - 85:31)
probably been Daya (85:29 - 85:33)
mind sometimes like it is in the game (85:31 - 85:37)
it&#39;s 200 Mega Energy 200 that&#39;s not (85:33 - 85:39)
bad yeah so you probably have to do (85:37 - 85:43)
three three raids to get it yeah if you (85:39 - 85:46)
have a good team yeah you aren&#39;t going (85:43 - 85:49)
solo yeah (85:46 - 85:52)
yeah uh Heracross has been in raids (85:49 - 85:54)
before yeah yeah three it&#39;s usually a (85:52 - 85:57)
three star raid when it&#39;s been it was (85:54 - 86:00)
the jto tour it was in raids I think for (85:57 - 86:02)
everyone right right yeah couldn&#39;t have (86:00 - 86:04)
him just spawn the J toor had to put him (86:02 - 86:07)
in raids had to put him in raids (86:04 - 86:09)
yeah look Niantic Niantic needs their (86:07 - 86:11)
bills paid they don&#39;t make enough money (86:09 - 86:13)
as it (86:11 - 86:13)
is uh we will be back next week although (86:14 - 86:19)
I will have to record the episode a (86:17 - 86:21)
little bit early so I I have to figure (86:19 - 86:23)
that out but (86:21 - 86:25)
um if (86:23 - 86:27)
if if the episode comes out on Sunday (86:25 - 86:30)
and uh next sorry next Monday and you&#39;re (86:27 - 86:31)
like why didn&#39;t we talk about this it&#39;s (86:30 - 86:33)
because I probably recorded it before I (86:31 - 86:34)
left for (86:33 - 86:36)
Florida uh although I don&#39;t expect (86:34 - 86:39)
anything exciting to happen at regionals (86:36 - 86:41)
and we already know Meganium is coming (86:39 - 86:44)
back this weekend if you haven&#39;t done it (86:41 - 86:47)
Blissey will also return with Meganium (86:44 - 86:49)
so if you need if you&#39;re one of those (86:47 - 86:51)
players that are like I want to do more (86:49 - 86:53)
seven or six star raids and I don&#39;t have (86:51 - 86:54)
a lot of level 100 Pokemon right don&#39;t (86:53 - 86:57)
have a lot of resources Blissey is a (86:54 - 87:00)
great way to get that to get those (86:57 - 87:02)
resources literally if you did like an (87:00 - 87:04)
hour of Blissey you could probably make (87:02 - 87:07)
like 10 level 100 Pokemon like (87:04 - 87:09)
instantly yeah now that we have the item (87:07 - 87:12)
printer it&#39;s not as useful but the (87:09 - 87:15)
blisses are still very good raids to do (87:12 - 87:16)
yeah yeah yeah totally and they&#39;re (87:15 - 87:19)
they&#39;re fairly quick which is nice so (87:16 - 87:22)
