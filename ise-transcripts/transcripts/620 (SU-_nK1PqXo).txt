sleep yeah you&#39;re going back to bed (0:35 - 0:39)

yeah it&#39;s just early over here because (0:39 - 0:43)
it&#39;s late in (0:42 - 0:48)
Japan it is yeah Bobby also here also (0:43 - 0:52)
tired it is I don&#39;t typically wake up (0:48 - 0:57)
this early so (0:52 - 1:02)
yeah perfect good great episode so far (0:57 - 1:05)
well surprise I&#39;m in Japan I&#39;ve been in (1:02 - 1:09)
Japan for 2 weeks uh I did the four days (1:05 - 1:13)
of go Fest well technically like three (1:09 - 1:15)
cuz I didn&#39;t really play today but that (1:13 - 1:19)
happened and I rode on the Pikachu train (1:15 - 1:23)
so that&#39;s cool and the reason I&#39;m (1:19 - 1:27)
leaving Fukushima early tomorrow is to (1:23 - 1:29)
go to the Pokemon cafe which I&#39;ve been (1:27 - 1:31)
but (1:29 - 1:33)
they have a new (1:31 - 1:33)
menu it&#39;s a new (1:35 - 1:40)
experience right uh also I&#39;m like (1:37 - 1:42)
Whispering because it&#39;s like 1:00 a.m. (1:40 - 1:47)
here and I just don&#39;t want to be rude to (1:42 - 1:49)
other Hotel people I don&#39;t know how a (1:47 - 1:51)
lot I&#39;m (1:49 - 1:53)
talking if you haven&#39;t been able to hear (1:51 - 1:56)
your neighbors at all they probably (1:53 - 1:58)
won&#39;t be able to hear you that much MH (1:56 - 2:01)
that&#39;s always my good measurement there (1:58 - 2:05)
yeah no I I haven&#39;t heard anyone at all (2:01 - 2:08)
so I don&#39;t know that&#39;s good maybe now (2:05 - 2:09)
you can (2:08 - 2:12)
yell probably not that perfect well (2:09 - 2:16)
let&#39;s yell about Pokemon sleep Bobby (2:12 - 2:18)
let&#39;s start with you how was your (2:16 - 2:21)
ente two (2:18 - 2:24)
weeks uh it&#39;s been really good actually (2:21 - 2:28)
so uh I think I was looking at this (2:24 - 2:31)
yesterday I think I got within this last (2:28 - 2:34)
two weeks I&#39;ve gotten like 40 almost 40 (2:31 - 2:37)
new sleep Styles like something like (2:34 - 2:40)
that yeah cuz going into it I was like I (2:37 - 2:43)
think I had like 110 and now I&#39;m just (2:40 - 2:48)
about to the 150 Mark nice so yeah um so (2:43 - 2:51)
that&#39;s been really good and uh I caught (2:48 - 2:53)
an ente I caught I only caught one this (2:51 - 2:57)
time I didn&#39;t try for another one um but (2:53 - 2:59)
then that left me with a ton of ente (2:57 - 3:01)
main to to spend (2:59 - 3:04)
on everything else that&#39;s everything (3:01 - 3:08)
else that&#39;s in that uh ente exchange so (3:04 - 3:10)
yeah it&#39;s been good it&#39;s been much (3:08 - 3:11)
better than the Reiko week for me since (3:10 - 3:13)
I had just like just started when that (3:11 - 3:17)
one when that one was uh was here so (3:13 - 3:18)
it&#39;s been (3:17 - 3:22)
good Hannah what about you I haven&#39;t (3:18 - 3:25)
caught any particularly exciting Pokémon (3:22 - 3:27)
but I have finished every single one of (3:25 - 3:29)
the missions and I&#39;m very proud of that (3:27 - 3:32)
I went to bed on time for exactly three (3:29 - 3:35)
nights in this (3:32 - 3:35)
event and that managed to get me the (3:35 - 3:40)
three nights from both of the weeks so (3:37 - 3:43)
completed all of the missions there also (3:40 - 3:46)
only caught one ente also have over 400 (3:43 - 3:50)
ente Main left for the main shop so I am (3:46 - 3:53)
looking forward to spending all of that (3:50 - 3:54)
probably after this podcast because (3:53 - 3:57)
otherwise I will (3:54 - 3:57)
forget did you guys need to summon (3:57 - 4:06)
multiple ente to catch one (4:03 - 4:10)
ente this time yeah yeah yeah I think (4:06 - 4:13)
like three (4:10 - 4:14)
times (4:13 - 4:17)
interesting I only needed to get it (4:14 - 4:18)
there (4:17 - 4:23)
twice so two incenses and biscuits all (4:18 - 4:24)
the way none of the biscuits ever (4:23 - 4:28)
critical hit yeah none of my biscuits (4:24 - 4:30)
ever critical hit my ante was not hungry (4:28 - 4:32)
any of the times even though I had every (4:30 - 4:34)
time I had a in ente incense I also used (4:32 - 4:35)
a friend (4:34 - 4:39)
incense yeahh and it never never was (4:35 - 4:42)
hungry and then the one of the times it (4:39 - 4:44)
only let me feed it (4:42 - 4:47)
twice and then it was full like after (4:44 - 4:49)
just like the second bis so I just I (4:47 - 4:51)
never got it took me yeah it took me (4:49 - 4:54)
three times it took me three (4:51 - 4:54)
times uh I think it was three times for (4:54 - 5:00)
me too I think it was like two biscuits (4:57 - 5:03)
full call it again two biscuits (5:00 - 5:09)
full call it again one more biscuit (5:03 - 5:13)
done yeah yeah that sounds right yeah (5:09 - 5:16)
and then I&#39;m uh calling one more tonight (5:13 - 5:19)
cuz I called another one and it gave let (5:16 - 5:22)
me do three biscuits and then it was (5:19 - 5:24)
full (5:22 - 5:28)
so sure will I bought the main skill (5:24 - 5:30)
seed the thing that mattered so mm I&#39;ll (5:28 - 5:33)
call one more well that was I was (5:30 - 5:35)
wondering about I was thinking about (5:33 - 5:38)
that um are you do you so you&#39;re not (5:35 - 5:42)
going to save an an ente incense for (5:38 - 5:48)
down the road I should have enough to (5:42 - 5:52)
buy one more incense after the rewards (5:48 - 5:54)
cash out in the morning (5:52 - 5:57)
oh okay yeah cuz but you can&#39;t hold two (5:54 - 6:00)
so I had to use it (5:57 - 6:03)
I see yeah yeah I was thinking about (6:00 - 6:05)
that too after after buying everything (6:03 - 6:06)
else that I was going to buy like all (6:05 - 6:08)
the candy and all the other things (6:06 - 6:11)
whether I wanted to if I have anything (6:08 - 6:13)
left then buy another incense just to (6:11 - 6:16)
hang on to it but (6:13 - 6:19)
um yeah I don&#39;t (6:16 - 6:19)
know I think you both have thoughts on (6:20 - 6:26)
the music I (6:23 - 6:30)
saw neither happy with the music I mean (6:26 - 6:35)
it&#39;s it&#39;s neat it&#39;s just not good at (6:30 - 6:38)
night it&#39;s a little high energy specific (6:35 - 6:41)
it&#39;s a littleg it&#39;s way too upbeat yeah (6:38 - 6:44)
I mean the title screen is already way (6:41 - 6:46)
too upbeat for when I&#39;m opening this app (6:44 - 6:49)
late at night and want to be getting (6:46 - 6:53)
into sleep mode but this new music just (6:49 - 6:54)
continues that and it means that I&#39;ve (6:53 - 6:58)
been keeping it on mute as much as (6:54 - 7:00)
possible yeah but (6:58 - 7:03)
it yeah I will say the the the intro (7:00 - 7:06)
music the uh or the title screen music (7:03 - 7:09)
the uh cooking music and they&#39;re they&#39;re (7:06 - 7:13)
both too upbeat when it&#39;s like 2 o&#39;l in (7:09 - 7:16)
the morning you know uh and this this (7:13 - 7:19)
music uh is is similar but during the (7:16 - 7:22)
middle of the day keep that phone uh (7:19 - 7:25)
that noise on and just let that music (7:22 - 7:26)
play it&#39;s (7:25 - 7:28)
great someday we&#39;re really going to need (7:26 - 7:31)
that album yeah (7:28 - 7:35)
yes did you both (7:31 - 7:39)
run good camp tickets both (7:35 - 7:43)
weeks I only ran one the first week but (7:39 - 7:44)
my flareon&#39;s been doing a pretty good (7:43 - 7:48)
job for the second week nice yeah I ran (7:44 - 7:52)
out I ran out both weeks for me did (7:48 - 7:54)
you yes (7:52 - 8:00)
I had enough free gems to buy (7:54 - 8:03)
a free ticket a free ticket I&#39;m air (8:00 - 8:05)
quoting didn&#39;t cost me anything I didn&#39;t (8:03 - 8:08)
spend any money (8:05 - 8:08)
but (8:08 - 8:11)
yes and now it&#39;s the first so I well I (8:12 - 8:20)
think the second is when I get rewards (8:18 - 8:22)
in the game so then I&#39;ll get another (8:20 - 8:26)
good camp ticket which I&#39;ll just save (8:22 - 8:28)
for some event both of you are on (8:26 - 8:30)
premium right (8:28 - 8:34)
yeah so I think mine rolls over on the (8:30 - 8:37)
9th so I&#39;ll get another good camp ticket (8:34 - 8:39)
on the 9th but I will say coming out of (8:37 - 8:40)
using a good camp ticket two weeks in a (8:39 - 8:42)
row I&#39;ll have to keep myself from trying (8:40 - 8:46)
to I I I do have enough Gems or diamonds (8:42 - 8:49)
to like get another one if I wanted to (8:46 - 8:51)
but like I definitely want to save them (8:49 - 8:55)
for like an event but uh yeah I don&#39;t (8:51 - 8:58)
want to I don&#39;t want to do that I I am (8:55 - 9:02)
trying to person who good camp tickets (8:58 - 9:04)
every week yeah just trying to spend a (9:02 - 9:08)
little money possible you could You&#39; be (9:04 - 9:11)
supporting this game very (9:08 - 9:14)
thoroughly somebody has (9:11 - 9:14)
to uh they the only like it&#39;s not even (9:15 - 9:23)
feedback or a complaint it&#39;s just they (9:20 - 9:25)
didn&#39;t communicate that we would start (9:23 - 9:28)
week two at Ultra (9:25 - 9:33)
4 mhm made it seem like the (9:28 - 9:38)
fire skill up bonuses were replacing (9:33 - 9:42)
that and I already committed to buying a (9:38 - 9:45)
camp ticket like a day or two (9:42 - 9:50)
before ohh so I I feel like I maybe (9:45 - 9:52)
wouldn&#39;t have in retrospect to be like (9:50 - 9:54)
Oh I&#39;m already level four everything&#39;s (9:52 - 9:57)
already (9:54 - 9:57)
boosted I don&#39;t know I&#39;m pretty sure (9:57 - 10:03)
they it&#39;s the (10:00 - 10:06)
same oh sorry what was that I&#39;m pretty (10:03 - 10:07)
sure they didn&#39;t communicate at the (10:06 - 10:09)
first time around with raicho either (10:07 - 10:12)
yeah yeah I didn&#39;t it&#39;s just a fun (10:09 - 10:16)
little surprise we we didn&#39;t have any (10:12 - 10:22)
electric uh skill boosts with the REO (10:16 - 10:22)
week otherwise did an would have been (10:22 - 10:29)
way too op ah right maybe that&#39;s why (10:25 - 10:31)
they&#39;re like oh no we broke to den we (10:29 - 10:34)
can&#39;t we can&#39;t give them (10:31 - 10:34)
anymore I think it&#39;s just me thinking of (10:34 - 10:39)
like I don&#39;t want to keep getting Camp (10:36 - 10:42)
tickets and a two-e event (10:39 - 10:48)
with a week prep event is a lot so like (10:42 - 10:51)
how can I be best optimize good camp (10:48 - 10:54)
tickets so when suun comes I think I (10:51 - 10:55)
will only stick to (10:54 - 10:58)
one yeah using the good camp ticket on (10:55 - 11:01)
the first week has ended up going pretty (10:58 - 11:05)
well so for me so far I&#39;m I think at the (11:01 - 11:07)
highest level I&#39;ve ever been on green (11:05 - 11:10)
grass which is Master 13 which I know is (11:07 - 11:13)
not as high as some people but I&#39;ve been (11:10 - 11:16)
kind of lazy with this game (11:13 - 11:21)
so how dare you be lazy with a sleep (11:16 - 11:21)
game I will say I missed at least like (11:22 - 11:28)
three meals this week which is like the (11:26 - 11:32)
first time in months like I would I (11:28 - 11:34)
think I missed breakfast twice because I (11:32 - 11:35)
was (11:34 - 11:39)
like out the door rushing to get to go (11:35 - 11:44)
Fest then playing go um so I think I (11:39 - 11:45)
missed breakfast twice and then I missed (11:44 - 11:47)
lunch (11:45 - 11:53)
once uh and that feels more bad when (11:47 - 11:55)
you&#39;re running a good camp (11:53 - 11:57)
ticket (11:55 - 12:00)
yeah yeah y (11:57 - 12:03)
it&#39;s fine still like Master rake 16 but (12:00 - 12:06)
like I could have been (12:03 - 12:08)
[Laughter] (12:06 - 12:11)
17 could have powered up my dream Curry (12:08 - 12:13)
more (12:11 - 12:16)
mhm that&#39;s (12:13 - 12:18)
uh I think that&#39;s it for Sleep there&#39;s (12:16 - 12:21)
like nothing on the horizon probably by (12:18 - 12:23)
the time this episode comes up there (12:21 - 12:27)
might be new Pokemon news event (12:23 - 12:30)
something but like we don&#39;t actually (12:27 - 12:34)
know what&#39;s coming in sleep as we record (12:30 - 12:38)
this yeah other than a good sleep day we (12:34 - 12:39)
can assume (12:38 - 12:43)
that right is are they typically on like (12:39 - 12:47)
a monthly schedule of releasing a new (12:43 - 12:47)
Pokemon not (12:47 - 12:53)
exactly it&#39;s when they feel like (12:50 - 12:57)
it I mean cuz we had we had Vulpix in (12:53 - 13:02)
May and we had k in April so I just (12:57 - 13:03)
wasn&#39;t sure if that was something that (13:02 - 13:05)
they are (13:03 - 13:09)
regularly pumping a little bit with the (13:05 - 13:12)
legendary beasts event events got it (13:09 - 13:15)
before that it was I think a little bit (13:12 - 13:18)
slower and more spread (13:15 - 13:18)
out did did Den come out before the (13:19 - 13:23)
Reich like right before the Reiko event (13:21 - 13:26)
like Vulpix did before the it wasn&#39;t the (13:23 - 13:28)
Vulpix (13:26 - 13:32)
of the vul Pi of electric (13:28 - 13:33)
Pokemon (13:32 - 13:37)
yeah yeah (13:33 - 13:37)
correct uh let&#39;s transition to go Fest (13:40 - 13:50)
which uh Japan had four days of go (13:45 - 13:54)
Fest uh Madrid will have three New York (13:50 - 13:57)
will have three I also think New York (13:54 - 14:01)
and Madrid start at 9: for for whatever (13:57 - 14:03)
reason Japan started at (14:01 - 14:07)
9:30 unsure why well the one time I&#39;m (14:03 - 14:09)
early to a go (14:07 - 14:13)
Fest but I thought it started at 9: so I (14:09 - 14:15)
was way too (14:13 - 14:19)
early let me isn&#39;t way too (14:15 - 14:22)
early well when the park has no spawns (14:19 - 14:24)
and no stops because you&#39;re waiting for (14:22 - 14:26)
Niantic to turn it on you&#39;re just like (14:24 - 14:29)
I&#39;m here (14:26 - 14:32)
oh look they&#39;re playing the same song (14:29 - 14:36)
they&#39;ve been playing for for seven (14:32 - 14:36)
[Music] (14:38 - 14:42)
years they breaking news they did add (14:43 - 14:52)
the ultra Beast no not the ultra Beast I (14:48 - 14:55)
think it was this soal lunala (14:52 - 14:58)
necrozma (14:55 - 15:00)
music I think they&#39;re all variations of (14:58 - 15:03)
each other so I&#39;m not exactly sure which (15:00 - 15:06)
one it was but they had (15:03 - 15:10)
that every now and then played every now (15:06 - 15:14)
and then that&#39;s better than just the one (15:10 - 15:16)
song on repeat because I can hear that (15:14 - 15:18)
song echoing in my head from when I went (15:16 - 15:21)
to go fest last (15:18 - 15:25)
year imagine going to every go Fest it&#39;s (15:21 - 15:28)
the same one (15:25 - 15:28)
um it wasn&#39;t (15:32 - 15:39)
111° like it was last year in Osaka it&#39;s (15:35 - 15:41)
good that was (15:39 - 15:46)
cool it did rain three out of the four (15:41 - 15:50)
days so that was not (15:46 - 15:55)
cool yeah not optimal for someone who (15:50 - 16:00)
streams uh everything outdoors (15:55 - 16:03)
yeah optimal for a computer in your (16:00 - 16:05)
backpack yeah (16:03 - 16:09)
correct which of the days (16:05 - 16:09)
disclosures the the day didn&#39;t rain was (16:10 - 16:15)
on it it didn&#39;t rain on Thursday which (16:13 - 16:18)
is like my Park day got it so I got (16:15 - 16:20)
lucky okay that&#39;s good but here are your (16:18 - 16:25)
disclosures Niantic did gift (16:20 - 16:30)
me a 4day pass to the event that was it (16:25 - 16:35)
Hotel flight all on me I bought the (16:30 - 16:38)
hoodie all on (16:35 - 16:40)
me I think that&#39;s all I bought I think (16:38 - 16:41)
that&#39;s all I gave (16:40 - 16:45)
him the $50 hoodie or whatever it was (16:41 - 16:46)
this is the first year they did hoodies (16:45 - 16:48)
so that was kind of (16:46 - 16:49)
cool (16:48 - 16:53)
um yeah uh that&#39;s it (16:49 - 16:55)
so (16:53 - 16:58)
the park experience was still four hours (16:55 - 17:01)
in the park and then 4 Hour 4 hours (16:58 - 17:05)
anywhere in Sendai there was like the 30 (17:01 - 17:08)
minute break in the park where no one (17:05 - 17:10)
could play but if you had the City (17:08 - 17:12)
ticket obviously as soon as you left the (17:10 - 17:16)
park spawns would pop back (17:12 - 17:19)
up (17:16 - 17:19)
and then you could play anywhere in (17:19 - 17:26)
Sendai um there was like an outdoor mall (17:21 - 17:29)
which was like covered and the only time (17:26 - 17:30)
it was n covered (17:29 - 17:32)
is I don&#39;t know how to explain an (17:30 - 17:34)
outdoor mall this is probably very (17:32 - 17:36)
common in California you&#39;ve been to (17:34 - 17:39)
Japan Bobby I have been to Japan but I&#39;m (17:36 - 17:41)
just what&#39;s an outdoor covered mall I (17:39 - 17:45)
mean it&#39;s like a giant hallway with (17:41 - 17:47)
stores on the sides and the hallway has (17:45 - 17:48)
a (17:47 - 17:52)
roof yeah oh I see what you&#39;re saying (17:48 - 17:55)
okay now about your your Twitch stream I (17:52 - 17:58)
think you were walking through it the (17:55 - 17:59)
other day when I was watching yeah (17:58 - 18:01)
walking around it okay the hallway is (17:59 - 18:05)
not like a building it just happens to (18:01 - 18:08)
have a roof right right like there (18:05 - 18:11)
aren&#39;t walls on the ends of this hallway (18:08 - 18:14)
it&#39;s like it&#39;s just it&#39;s like a tunnel (18:11 - 18:17)
almost but probably with like glass on (18:14 - 18:19)
the roof or something so it&#39;s lighter (18:17 - 18:20)
I&#39;m (18:19 - 18:24)
guessing yeah probably it was big I (18:20 - 18:26)
don&#39;t know I we don&#39;t have we don&#39;t need (18:24 - 18:30)
roofs on our malls our outdoor malls and (18:26 - 18:33)
Diego I think that&#39;s where they wanted (18:30 - 18:35)
us to play because that&#39;s where the (18:33 - 18:37)
stores were partnered with so some (18:35 - 18:40)
stores had posters and then if you got (18:37 - 18:42)
went inside and you bought something (18:40 - 18:44)
they would give you a (18:42 - 18:46)
surprise the (18:44 - 18:50)
surprise was a sticker that was it there (18:46 - 18:53)
you go just a sticker was it sticker (18:50 - 18:55)
from every (18:53 - 18:58)
store I&#39;m not sure I only bought from (18:55 - 19:02)
one okay but there was a QR code on the (18:58 - 19:03)
back of the sticker and I was like oh (19:02 - 19:05)
cool maybe you scan it you get like two (19:03 - 19:07)
lucky eggs and an incense or something (19:05 - 19:10)
that&#39;d be cool it was just an ad to take (19:07 - 19:12)
you (19:10 - 19:14)
to (19:12 - 19:17)
pokemongolive.com and then (19:14 - 19:19)
the (19:17 - 19:22)
surprise this is (19:19 - 19:26)
a hey it&#39;s marketing I mean it is (19:22 - 19:28)
marketing get it but yeah I think they (19:26 - 19:30)
wanted us to play in that mall because (19:28 - 19:32)
that is where the (19:30 - 19:36)
Lapras manhole cover was the Pokey lid (19:32 - 19:40)
mhm and they had like (19:36 - 19:43)
um an arch like they set up like little (19:40 - 19:45)
Lapras signs and stuff and then people (19:43 - 19:48)
would line up to take a picture of the (19:45 - 19:51)
Lapras cuz Japan loves lines so everyone (19:48 - 19:54)
was getting in line and then there was a (19:51 - 19:55)
huge (19:54 - 19:59)
blowup Lapras but that was near the (19:55 - 20:02)
river which was maybe like a 10-minute (19:59 - 20:05)
walk from that like Mall Park thing but (20:02 - 20:07)
it was (20:05 - 20:10)
raining so I was like ah maybe when it (20:07 - 20:12)
stops raining I&#39;ll walk over and then it (20:10 - 20:16)
never really did stop rainning yeah was (20:12 - 20:19)
it a blowup Lapras like the (20:16 - 20:21)
one it&#39;s been there&#39;s been a blowup (20:19 - 20:23)
Lapras at other go Fest events like the (20:21 - 20:26)
giant it was bigger really it was a new (20:23 - 20:30)
one oh no yeah it was even bigger (20:26 - 20:35)
wow and they had a Lapras Cafe but I (20:30 - 20:38)
didn&#39;t make it to that (20:35 - 20:41)
either because the one time we were (20:38 - 20:42)
going it started (20:41 - 20:45)
raining and then we were going to go (20:42 - 20:48)
again but it was it was like Saturday (20:45 - 20:50)
and I was like there&#39;s why even go (20:48 - 20:51)
there&#39;s the line&#39;s going to be so long (20:50 - 20:53)
it&#39;s Saturday we should have went (20:51 - 20:55)
yesterday but it&#39;s was raining (20:53 - 20:57)
yesterday (20:55 - 20:59)
so I don&#39;t know know what the Lapras (20:57 - 21:03)
Cafe had I do know stores (20:59 - 21:06)
had it was like a maybe Hannah knows (21:03 - 21:09)
with this is something they sell in (21:06 - 21:12)
Japan it&#39;s fish something that they (21:09 - 21:16)
press and Lapras was on the (21:12 - 21:19)
cover I think it was like fish paste (21:16 - 21:22)
yeah I don&#39;t know what that&#39;s called but (21:19 - 21:23)
I think you&#39;re right that that&#39;s what (21:22 - 21:24)
that (21:23 - 21:29)
is and I I like Lapras (21:24 - 21:33)
like fish paste so I didn&#39;t buy (21:29 - 21:38)
it that&#39;s fair they definitely had like (21:33 - 21:41)
it kind of looked like a booster pack (21:38 - 21:43)
and they did say something was (21:41 - 21:44)
randomized on the inside I&#39;m sure it was (21:43 - 21:45)
like a (21:44 - 21:50)
sticker more stickers but no go on the (21:45 - 21:53)
fish fish (21:50 - 21:53)
face trying new things you did get what (21:54 - 21:59)
was it Zapdos (21:57 - 22:02)
wipes like deodorizing hand wipes or (21:59 - 22:07)
something like that I found (22:02 - 22:07)
that that was not Echo Fest it was (22:07 - 22:13)
pretty good (22:11 - 22:13)
though uh shiny ratewise if I&#39;ve been to (22:15 - 22:23)
every go Fest except New (22:19 - 22:24)
York (22:23 - 22:28)
but every year I&#39;ve gone to a go Fest (22:24 - 22:30)
and I&#39;ve gone to to multiple go fests (22:28 - 22:32)
multip when they did have them in (22:30 - 22:34)
multiple years shiny rates felt exactly (22:32 - 22:35)
the (22:34 - 22:38)
same I know people are like are they (22:35 - 22:40)
boosting it is it it doesn&#39;t feel as (22:38 - 22:42)
good as last year it feels better they (22:40 - 22:44)
felt the same as I played all of them (22:42 - 22:48)
they felt the same (22:44 - 22:53)
on Saturday I got 13 shinies this is not (22:48 - 22:56)
to break this is just like played eight (22:53 - 22:59)
hours got 13 shinies on Thursday played (22:56 - 23:04)
8 hours got 20 shinies today played 1 (22:59 - 23:07)
hour seven (23:04 - 23:10)
shinies just it&#39;s just RNG that&#39;s all it (23:07 - 23:13)
is I didn&#39;t do anything different or (23:10 - 23:19)
special I just tapped on think that was (23:13 - 23:19)
it (23:19 - 23:25)
yeah everyone was in a good mood though (23:22 - 23:30)
like I the rain didn&#39;t seem to (23:25 - 23:33)
like upset any like I&#39;m sure people were (23:30 - 23:37)
upset obviously but like the general mve (23:33 - 23:41)
of the event mhm everyone seemed like (23:37 - 23:44)
they were having a good time good I was (23:41 - 23:47)
was it um was it super crowded or like (23:44 - 23:51)
it was the Park good (23:47 - 23:54)
for it being spread out I mean how did (23:51 - 23:58)
it feel as far as being in the event in (23:54 - 24:00)
the park I guess let&#39;s see I went to the (23:58 - 24:03)
park (24:00 - 24:03)
twice even though you could only play in (24:03 - 24:07)
the park once but I I had to go back to (24:05 - 24:11)
the park to pick up the hoodie mhm and (24:07 - 24:13)
so I still just like did a lap and just (24:11 - 24:15)
like walked around um but when I did (24:13 - 24:18)
play in the park it felt great like it (24:15 - 24:21)
wasn&#39;t too busy the park was smaller (24:18 - 24:23)
than (24:21 - 24:23)
Osaka but like not in a bad way like it (24:23 - 24:29)
it was like oh I can make it to the (24:28 - 24:31)
other end of the park without like (24:29 - 24:33)
breaking a (24:31 - 24:36)
sweat like the whole park felt good they (24:33 - 24:39)
did have some food trucks at the very (24:36 - 24:44)
front there was one Cafe in the park not (24:39 - 24:46)
enough bathrooms in the park that would (24:44 - 24:51)
be my complaint the Osaka Park had tons (24:46 - 24:54)
of bathrooms tons of restaurants in the (24:51 - 25:00)
76 Expo so it didn&#39;t feel like (24:54 - 25:01)
you were waiting long to go to the (25:00 - 25:03)
bathroom or to (25:01 - 25:05)
eat uh same with like (25:03 - 25:11)
Berlin plenty of food stalls bathrooms (25:05 - 25:13)
everything I could only think of like (25:11 - 25:15)
one (25:13 - 25:17)
bathroom that I went I know there were (25:15 - 25:20)
more on the map there are four but two (25:17 - 25:24)
of them are really out of the (25:20 - 25:24)
way I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a port (25:24 - 25:31)
poy in Japan I&#39;m sure they (25:28 - 25:34)
exist but (25:31 - 25:37)
like I remember seeing pictures of the (25:34 - 25:40)
London go Fest MH and I&#39;ve been to so (25:37 - 25:42)
many American go fests and it&#39;s just (25:40 - 25:46)
like a hallway the potties yeah that&#39;s (25:42 - 25:48)
what New York was (25:46 - 25:52)
yeah not (25:48 - 25:52)
here it sounds like maybe you could have (25:52 - 25:57)
used some though yeah yeah seriously it (25:54 - 25:59)
was (25:57 - 26:01)
like (25:59 - 26:04)
again not a bummer it&#39;s just like oh we (26:01 - 26:06)
have to like wait in line to go to the (26:04 - 26:08)
bathroom kind of wish there was more (26:06 - 26:10)
like last year but the park last year (26:08 - 26:13)
was like three times the size it was (26:10 - 26:16)
just so much bigger Park feel (26:13 - 26:18)
crowded no it didn&#39;t feel crowded it (26:16 - 26:22)
didn&#39;t uh it was not (26:18 - 26:25)
gated there was no one checking ticket (26:22 - 26:28)
or looking at your thing MH New York (26:25 - 26:30)
wasn&#39;t gated (26:28 - 26:32)
no but it was on an (26:30 - 26:38)
island which kind of like a natural gate (26:32 - 26:39)
yeah (26:38 - 26:43)
so C go tour was (26:39 - 26:45)
gated and (26:43 - 26:49)
then 76 Expo last year in Osaka was (26:45 - 26:53)
gated but they were like natural Gates (26:49 - 26:55)
they like Niantic didn&#39;t build them oh (26:53 - 26:59)
right right yeah well it they they they (26:55 - 27:01)
make it so that the spawns don&#39;t show up (26:59 - 27:05)
for any non-tick holders anyway right so (27:01 - 27:06)
if you&#39;re there yeah (27:05 - 27:08)
so yeah I went back to the park on (27:06 - 27:10)
Friday to pick up the (27:08 - 27:14)
hoodies I still had like I could still (27:10 - 27:16)
see spawns and get the everything cuz I (27:14 - 27:20)
had like a Creator ticket yeah (27:16 - 27:22)
um but (27:20 - 27:26)
like it&#39;s not as great as it seems just (27:22 - 27:30)
like I do think the city ex like it&#39;s (27:26 - 27:32)
not it&#39;s not to say the park experience (27:30 - 27:34)
is bad I think 4 hours in the park is (27:32 - 27:38)
absolutely fantastic mhm but I think (27:34 - 27:40)
having that flexibility of like I can (27:38 - 27:41)
play where I (27:40 - 27:44)
want um not all my friends have a ticket (27:41 - 27:46)
so they can play with me I can go (27:44 - 27:49)
shopping I can slow down I can there&#39;s (27:46 - 27:51)
way more food options I just think the (27:49 - 27:52)
city (27:51 - 27:57)
experience is a fantastic thing MH yeah (27:52 - 27:59)
if it&#39;s if it was anything like New York (27:57 - 28:01)
I think my opinion at this point is that (27:59 - 28:04)
the city experience is better but the P (28:01 - 28:07)
the park experience is necessary that (28:04 - 28:08)
the park experience is part of what (28:07 - 28:11)
makes it feel like a Pokemon go event is (28:08 - 28:13)
part of what makes it feel like a go (28:11 - 28:16)
Fest yeah but overall the city (28:13 - 28:19)
experience is more fun well they can (28:16 - 28:21)
control the Park event as well right so (28:19 - 28:22)
that&#39;s where you have a little bit more (28:21 - 28:24)
organization when it comes (28:22 - 28:29)
to Niantic related things versus just (28:24 - 28:31)
just playing the game and nothing else (28:29 - 28:34)
right so but so with the city part did (28:31 - 28:38)
uh anyone who ticket or non-tick people (28:34 - 28:40)
who were playing incendi saw like (28:38 - 28:42)
special spawns and stuff throughout the (28:40 - 28:45)
city or did you have to have a ticket (28:42 - 28:45)
still they would have to have a ticket (28:46 - 28:53)
they could still do raids though okay (28:49 - 28:54)
right but it but it worked on the days (28:53 - 28:57)
that weren&#39;t like your Park day like did (28:54 - 28:59)
you if so if you a ticket were you able (28:57 - 29:01)
to see City spawns like throughout the (28:59 - 29:03)
four days or it was only on your pay for (29:01 - 29:05)
separate City days those are add-ons and (29:03 - 29:07)
you paid you had to pay for each City so (29:05 - 29:08)
each one of the city days you would have (29:07 - 29:13)
to pay for MH okay got it so that&#39;s the (29:08 - 29:15)
part I didn&#39;t pay for because it was (29:13 - 29:21)
gifted but sure but a non you would (29:15 - 29:22)
would be paying for those like extra (29:21 - 29:24)
days yes I helped I helped my friend (29:22 - 29:27)
Julie buy her a ticket cuzz she normally (29:24 - 29:30)
pays cuz she lives here and she normally (29:27 - 29:32)
pays like (29:30 - 29:38)
sua cash or PayPal but niantic&#39;s website (29:32 - 29:40)
only takes like visa and (29:38 - 29:43)
MasterCard so I was like oh I&#39;ll help (29:40 - 29:44)
you buy your ticket and then you could (29:43 - 29:47)
just PayPal me because niantic&#39;s website (29:44 - 29:51)
doesn&#39;t take PayPal and I think when she (29:47 - 29:56)
did go Fest plus three cities plus egg (29:51 - 29:59)
plus raid pass (29:56 - 30:01)
it was (29:59 - 30:01)
$90 which is (30:02 - 30:08)
probably that was the city experience (30:05 - 30:11)
for all of the days all four days yeah (30:08 - 30:13)
yeah okay that makes sense well three (30:11 - 30:17)
Tech three add-on days yeah (30:13 - 30:20)
$90 I&#39;m trying to figure out if I think (30:17 - 30:23)
that&#39;s expensive or not like you know (30:20 - 30:24)
it&#39;s it&#39;s obviously that&#39;s obviously (30:23 - 30:30)
relative but I I mean (30:24 - 30:33)
H it kind of seems like a lot of money (30:30 - 30:35)
it is when you add all of the add-ons (30:33 - 30:40)
you can get it up to a very uh expensive (30:35 - 30:43)
price to go to these events but relative (30:40 - 30:45)
to the travel cost it&#39;s still pretty low (30:43 - 30:48)
which is why they&#39;re able to kind of (30:45 - 30:50)
make it make sense in people&#39;s (30:48 - 30:53)
minds right I just my thought is like if (30:50 - 30:55)
you&#39;re already paying those travel costs (30:53 - 30:58)
then having to Shell out another you (30:55 - 31:01)
know 100 some dollars potentially um (30:58 - 31:06)
seems like a lot I&#39;m on the go Fest uh (31:01 - 31:08)
what is it Madrid website right now and (31:06 - 31:10)
just choosing all of the add-ons and (31:08 - 31:13)
seeing how expensive I can make it you (31:10 - 31:15)
can make it almost (31:13 - 31:19)
$300 that&#39;s like with shirts and Hoodie (31:15 - 31:22)
yeah and tote (31:19 - 31:22)
yeah yeah I (31:22 - 31:28)
mean I get I I see both sides like cuz (31:25 - 31:29)
obviously like if you&#39;re going to go to (31:28 - 31:31)
an event you know it&#39;s possible that (31:29 - 31:33)
you&#39;re like okay this is where I&#39;m (31:31 - 31:35)
spending my money I&#39;m going to this like (31:33 - 31:37)
inperson event I want to be able to do (31:35 - 31:42)
all the things for that event um (31:37 - 31:45)
but yeah that&#39;s just a long ways from (31:42 - 31:49)
like oh go Fest $15 like it&#39;s like oh go (31:45 - 31:51)
Fest (31:49 - 31:56)
$300 it&#39;s not $15 (31:51 - 31:56)
anymore well here let&#39;s take a (31:56 - 32:03)
break and then we&#39;ll finish talking (32:00 - 32:05)
about go Fest and then I can tell you a (32:03 - 32:07)
different way that the Pokemon company (32:05 - 32:09)
will scam you for (32:07 - 32:14)
money which is way funnier in my opinion (32:09 - 32:17)
we&#39;ll be right (32:14 - 32:17)
back and we are back from our (32:18 - 32:25)
break uh I feel like we have to talk (32:21 - 32:29)
about Network (32:25 - 32:29)
the park did have a lot of cows cows are (32:29 - 32:37)
cellular on Wheels I think the two big (32:33 - 32:43)
providers in Japan are do and soft (32:37 - 32:45)
bank and they were there and then I (32:43 - 32:49)
think Japan uses Au which was there and (32:45 - 32:55)
then one more brand that I don&#39;t (32:49 - 32:59)
know there were (32:55 - 32:59)
dead spots for me in the Park oh no on (32:59 - 33:09)
it and I can&#39;t think of a go Fest that (33:05 - 33:12)
didn&#39;t have dead spots just a standard (33:09 - 33:14)
for (33:12 - 33:18)
ntic look I think I think (33:14 - 33:21)
connecting thousands of players yeah in (33:18 - 33:24)
an area with different I don&#39;t know how (33:21 - 33:26)
interference works or (33:24 - 33:29)
how like where&#39;s the best place to park (33:26 - 33:32)
this cow versus parking this cow and (33:29 - 33:34)
what is getting covered and what&#39;s not (33:32 - 33:37)
and trees and (33:34 - 33:37)
interference it was fine like the I was (33:38 - 33:44)
once you realized there was a dead spot (33:42 - 33:45)
you&#39;re just like okay I&#39;m going to walk (33:44 - 33:48)
through and not tap anything or I&#39;m just (33:45 - 33:50)
going to avoid that (33:48 - 33:52)
spot and it didn&#39;t seem like any (33:50 - 33:56)
singular cellular cell cellular provider (33:52 - 33:58)
just sort of tapped out and Stu working (33:56 - 34:00)
for any stretch of (33:58 - 34:03)
it no there was no like everyone&#39;s down (34:00 - 34:05)
for a reason there was no like Verizon&#39;s (34:03 - 34:08)
just randomly down for two hours yeah it (34:05 - 34:12)
was more than two hours but yeah (34:08 - 34:16)
cool I had three different four differ (34:12 - 34:19)
of cards I had SoftBank (34:16 - 34:22)
Doo (34:19 - 34:23)
Au (34:22 - 34:26)
and what&#39;s that Japanese flower called (34:23 - 34:29)
Sakura mhm wait why did you have four (34:26 - 34:30)
different did you have four (34:29 - 34:33)
devices (34:30 - 34:36)
no my backpack uses (34:33 - 34:40)
two oh and then they&#39;re bonded together (34:36 - 34:44)
so my backpack was using dok and soft (34:40 - 34:48)
bank and then my AT&amp;T number turned into (34:44 - 34:49)
an (34:48 - 34:55)
au got it and then (34:49 - 34:55)
Sakura I think is like (34:55 - 35:01)
how Boost Mobile or Cricket or mint (34:58 - 35:05)
mobile like they&#39;re using somebody else (35:01 - 35:08)
but I&#39;m not sure who they&#39;re (35:05 - 35:08)
using but (35:09 - 35:12)
I again I don&#39;t know who Sakura is using (35:13 - 35:20)
but it worked fantasttic I I&#39;ve used it (35:17 - 35:22)
three this is the third time I&#39;ve used (35:20 - 35:24)
used it it it&#39;s worked fantastic every (35:22 - 35:26)
time I come to (35:24 - 35:30)
Japan but this time (35:26 - 35:30)
it did get a little wonky in the park (35:31 - 35:38)
and oddly enough he look I worked I (35:35 - 35:40)
worked for Apple for five years I don&#39;t (35:38 - 35:42)
need any comments telling me how (35:40 - 35:46)
technology works I know that like the (35:42 - 35:49)
apps on iPhone are not supposed to be (35:46 - 35:51)
running they&#39;re supposed to be paused (35:49 - 35:53)
and you don&#39;t have to like force close (35:51 - 35:54)
them Bobby knows what I&#39;m talking about (35:53 - 35:59)
MH yes but for some reason maybe was cuz (35:54 - 36:03)
I was playing go and streaming go for my (35:59 - 36:07)
phone if I closed the apps it did make (36:03 - 36:10)
my phone run better oh (36:07 - 36:13)
no well and I know that&#39;s like not (36:10 - 36:15)
supposed to happen but I had four days (36:13 - 36:18)
to test (36:15 - 36:21)
this also I don&#39;t know on iPhone I do (36:18 - 36:23)
know again I don&#39;t need to TCH people (36:21 - 36:25)
I&#39;m just talking out loud there&#39;s a (36:23 - 36:26)
there&#39;s a little when you have two SIM (36:25 - 36:28)
cards cuz you can have two SIM cards (36:26 - 36:30)
rning on an iPhone at once and then you (36:28 - 36:33)
can set it to one being data and then (36:30 - 36:35)
one being I think it&#39;s like voice or (36:33 - 36:38)
something mhm or you could set them both (36:35 - 36:42)
to be the same there&#39;s a little button (36:38 - 36:46)
that says allow cellular (36:42 - 36:49)
switching and you could turn that (36:46 - 36:51)
on I think that just made things worse (36:49 - 36:54)
for me all (36:51 - 36:54)
weekend um (36:54 - 36:58)
but it&#39;s not like my backpack where it&#39;s (36:59 - 37:03)
not (37:02 - 37:08)
bonded where when you Bond two SIM (37:03 - 37:11)
cards it&#39;s actively switching and (37:08 - 37:15)
sharing the data to optimize it this on (37:11 - 37:18)
the iPhone I think it just literally (37:15 - 37:22)
switches networks so it takes I&#39;m (37:18 - 37:25)
assuming like a second or two to do that (37:22 - 37:27)
yeah so it&#39;s just constantly dropping as (37:25 - 37:28)
it&#39;s switching (37:27 - 37:33)
Yeah Yeah final thing about the SIM card (37:28 - 37:37)
stuff sandai station (37:33 - 37:40)
was so my hotel was right next to sandai (37:37 - 37:42)
station when you come into sandai (37:40 - 37:44)
station it&#39;s it&#39;s where the bullet train (37:42 - 37:47)
goes there&#39;s a Subway that took you to (37:44 - 37:49)
the park there&#39;s other trains there&#39;s a (37:47 - 37:52)
train line to the airport it&#39;s a it&#39;s (37:49 - 37:54)
not like Tokyo Station or shabuya or (37:52 - 37:56)
like it&#39;s it&#39;s a big station but not (37:54 - 38:01)
nearly as big MH and from the station to (37:56 - 38:03)
that mall I was talking about was (38:01 - 38:06)
probably a 6 s minute walk and then in (38:03 - 38:08)
between there is a different Mall which (38:06 - 38:11)
is where the Pokemon Center (38:08 - 38:14)
is that (38:11 - 38:17)
station where all the taxis and buses (38:14 - 38:21)
and was amazing on Wednesday night great (38:17 - 38:25)
to play Perfect everyone lured it up it (38:21 - 38:28)
was fantastic Thursday morning when the (38:25 - 38:32)
event started great fine perfect after (38:28 - 38:34)
that point never again it was a whole (38:32 - 38:38)
Dead Zone and people were (38:34 - 38:41)
actively on the bridges cuz there&#39;s like (38:38 - 38:43)
Bridges going over the streets so the (38:41 - 38:47)
buses go under just so many people (38:43 - 38:49)
playing on the bridges (38:47 - 38:52)
playing doing (38:49 - 38:56)
raids and me and literally everyone else (38:52 - 38:58)
I was with we were like we can&#39;t play (38:56 - 39:02)
here and Julie is from Japan she has a (38:58 - 39:04)
legit soft (39:02 - 39:08)
Bank uh account she has a dok like (39:04 - 39:10)
Hotpot she was like I have no service (39:08 - 39:13)
here I was like I have no service here (39:10 - 39:14)
other person I was playing with has no (39:13 - 39:16)
service here but literally as soon as we (39:14 - 39:19)
walked to that mall (39:16 - 39:22)
area perfect everything was fine the (39:19 - 39:26)
kicker the craziest part is if I turned (39:22 - 39:30)
LTE off and I switched to 3G (39:26 - 39:34)
3G worked perfect fine great I was (39:30 - 39:39)
loading the app faster on 3G than LTE or (39:34 - 39:43)
5G that that used to be the the move (39:39 - 39:46)
like when you back when like football (39:43 - 39:48)
stadiums or you go to like a football (39:46 - 39:49)
game or baseball game or somewhere where (39:48 - 39:51)
there&#39;s like a large crowd of people (39:49 - 39:52)
that all potentially are like using (39:51 - 39:56)
their phone right um you&#39;d switch to the (39:52 - 39:58)
to the one that isn&#39;t (39:56 - 40:00)
whatever the newest is right so if it&#39;s (39:58 - 40:03)
LT you switch down to 3G and yeah it&#39;s a (40:00 - 40:05)
little bit slower but it&#39;s working (40:03 - 40:08)
because a majority of the people are on (40:05 - 40:11)
the on the LTE or whatever the the later (40:08 - 40:14)
thing is and so they&#39;re not using up the (40:11 - 40:16)
and I don&#39;t know exact I&#39;m not a network (40:14 - 40:17)
person I don&#39;t know how that works and (40:16 - 40:20)
here another we don&#39;t need tech people (40:17 - 40:23)
in the comments but it&#39;s I do know that (40:20 - 40:25)
when you like would switch to you know (40:23 - 40:28)
to 3G it would uh you know it would (40:25 - 40:32)
become workable even if it was slower so (40:28 - 40:35)
you just played all of it on 3G then or (40:32 - 40:37)
no I just had to like switch to 3G when (40:35 - 40:39)
I was waiting for the (40:37 - 40:42)
train that was it cuz I wasn&#39;t playing (40:39 - 40:44)
at the station but I was (40:42 - 40:48)
like I was commuting into Sendai cuz I (40:44 - 40:51)
my fir my hotel was Wednesday and (40:48 - 40:53)
Wednesday and Thursday Thursday and (40:51 - 40:56)
Friday and then I checked out so I was (40:53 - 40:59)
it was cool to see Sendai (40:56 - 41:03)
before thousands of people came in mhm (40:59 - 41:07)
and Thursday was not nearly as busy like (41:03 - 41:10)
it was a lighter day and then even (41:07 - 41:12)
Friday (41:10 - 41:14)
felt I don&#39;t know (41:12 - 41:18)
light but interesting and Friday I was (41:14 - 41:21)
worried because I was like okay Friday (41:18 - 41:23)
it&#39;s raining everyone&#39;s going to go to (41:21 - 41:24)
the (41:23 - 41:28)
mall but it didn&#39;t feel any busier than (41:24 - 41:31)
Thursday when I went to the mall and it (41:28 - 41:32)
was gorgeous (41:31 - 41:35)
out and Saturday and (41:32 - 41:38)
Sunday just a nightmare of people just (41:35 - 41:41)
so many people because it was raining (41:38 - 41:43)
too so those go you couldn&#39;t spread them (41:41 - 41:45)
out more people wanted (41:43 - 41:49)
to get cover MH they sold a lot of (41:45 - 41:51)
umbrellas I&#39;ll tell you (41:49 - 41:54)
that that&#39;s the that&#39;s the move that&#39;s (41:51 - 41:58)
the umbrella sales um so you said you (41:54 - 42:00)
were in the park you went back to the (41:58 - 42:03)
park on Friday to pick up those hoodies (42:00 - 42:06)
yeah there was like a 2hour window where (42:03 - 42:08)
it didn&#39;t (42:06 - 42:11)
rain okay and would you say the park was (42:08 - 42:13)
more crowded so you didn&#39;t go to the (42:11 - 42:16)
park on Saturday or Sunday no I didn&#39;t (42:13 - 42:18)
I&#39;m okay was it more crowded on Friday (42:16 - 42:21)
or Thursday for you when you were there (42:18 - 42:23)
at the park they seemed equal but I (42:21 - 42:25)
can&#39;t imagine Saturday or Sunday would (42:23 - 42:27)
be more crowded because it was a 4 day (42:25 - 42:30)
event and the park would have an (42:27 - 42:32)
attendance (42:30 - 42:32)
cap I guess that&#39;s true sell out right (42:33 - 42:38)
see all the days sold out yeah (42:36 - 42:41)
yeah yeah that&#39;s (42:38 - 42:42)
true unless they had I mean they were (42:41 - 42:44)
running I mean they were running more (42:42 - 42:47)
trains (42:44 - 42:47)
available I don&#39;t think (42:47 - 42:51)
they yeah I don&#39;t know why they would (42:51 - 42:57)
like be like 5,000 people are allowed on (42:53 - 43:00)
Friday Friday and 6,000 are on Saturday (42:57 - 43:04)
when they could have sold six on (43:00 - 43:06)
Friday like (43:04 - 43:09)
every I I yeah that&#39;s true that&#39;s true (43:06 - 43:11)
but maybe they (43:09 - 43:14)
did I&#39;m not (43:11 - 43:18)
sure overall (43:14 - 43:20)
good (43:18 - 43:22)
the I thought the spawns and everything (43:20 - 43:23)
were (43:22 - 43:27)
great um the quest line was relatively (43:23 - 43:29)
easy (43:27 - 43:33)
no party play at all for any of the (43:29 - 43:36)
quests they did have like make one (43:33 - 43:40)
friend trade three (43:36 - 43:40)
times that was like maybe the hardest (43:40 - 43:46)
thing to do was make a friend and (43:43 - 43:48)
[Laughter] (43:46 - 43:52)
trade you know antisocial people any (43:48 - 43:54)
routes like did they uh utilize routes (43:52 - 43:55)
at (43:54 - 43:58)
all there was from my understanding an (43:55 - 44:00)
official route in the park and then (43:58 - 44:03)
around the park I forgot to do (44:00 - 44:06)
those so okay they weren no rewards (44:03 - 44:09)
linked to rout yeah there was like no (44:06 - 44:12)
Pokemon tied to the route okay okay I (44:09 - 44:19)
got every Pokemon Shiny that you could (44:12 - 44:22)
except for (44:19 - 44:22)
fanus random one that was it all right (44:23 - 44:29)
nice like nice cutie fly (44:26 - 44:34)
amoris Tyron Espeon Eevee Pikachu blais (44:29 - 44:37)
what what whatever the website (44:34 - 44:41)
says in each biome I got them all except (44:37 - 44:42)
for just (44:41 - 44:46)
fantis nice and like I said I didn&#39;t I (44:42 - 44:48)
only played an hour on (44:46 - 44:54)
Sunday and that&#39;s cuz I went more up (44:48 - 44:57)
north or more Japan is not north or (44:54 - 45:00)
south it&#39;s EAS or west so I want more (44:57 - 45:03)
East I guess it was (45:00 - 45:05)
North (45:03 - 45:08)
what North I don&#39;t think in Japan they (45:05 - 45:09)
say like up north I feel like there a (45:08 - 45:12)
very Wisconsin thing like I&#39;m going up (45:09 - 45:14)
north this weekend that is a very Wiscon (45:12 - 45:16)
I mean American thing but that doesn&#39;t (45:14 - 45:19)
mean that they don&#39;t have a North Japan (45:16 - 45:21)
yeah I&#39;m very (45:19 - 45:21)
confused yeah I mean the map in Japan is (45:22 - 45:28)
not broken into North and South it&#39;s (45:25 - 45:32)
broken into East and West so East (45:28 - 45:37)
is sua and then West (45:32 - 45:41)
is the Platypus I don&#39;t remember that (45:37 - 45:46)
name what is happening this a true (45:41 - 45:46)
thing I (45:49 - 45:53)
mean (45:52 - 45:56)
he I&#39;m not sure we have time to figure (45:53 - 45:59)
this out (45:56 - 45:59)
uh what are the differences between East (46:02 - 46:05)
and West (46:04 - 46:08)
Japan well no but like physically you (46:05 - 46:12)
went further north right your next (46:08 - 46:14)
location (46:12 - 46:19)
okay North does exist in Japan yes in my (46:14 - 46:24)
mind I went North and physically I went (46:19 - 46:29)
North emotionally I also went (46:24 - 46:32)
North so I went from (46:29 - 46:34)
Sendai I can&#39;t remember this I can&#39;t (46:32 - 46:37)
remember this (46:34 - 46:39)
stage it (46:37 - 46:42)
was it was 30 minutes on a bullet (46:39 - 46:45)
train so whatever that (46:42 - 46:49)
is that&#39;s 30 minutes north 30 minutes (46:45 - 46:51)
north (46:49 - 46:55)
yep and we got there to take the Pikachu (46:51 - 46:58)
train which is a ni train (46:55 - 47:01)
with Pikachu on it it&#39;s two (46:58 - 47:06)
cars the first car can only hold 40 (47:01 - 47:08)
people and then the second car is the (47:06 - 47:11)
called the play (47:08 - 47:11)
car okay and so when you get to the (47:11 - 47:17)
station you (47:15 - 47:20)
are no (47:17 - 47:23)
longer in I hate when people are like (47:20 - 47:25)
Japan is so in the future cuz it&#39;s not (47:23 - 47:27)
true cuz like if you break break your (47:25 - 47:29)
leg you got to like learn how to use a (47:27 - 47:31)
fax machine like some of their stuff is (47:29 - 47:32)
like so (47:31 - 47:35)
backwards but when you get to this (47:32 - 47:37)
station the future no longer (47:35 - 47:40)
exists you you got to hand you got to (47:37 - 47:42)
hand people your paper (47:40 - 47:46)
tickets there&#39;s no like tap to pay or (47:42 - 47:50)
whatever 7-Eleven doesn&#39;t exist you got (47:46 - 47:52)
you got to deal with new news day or (47:50 - 47:55)
whatever that Steve have you ever gone (47:52 - 47:58)
to to cities that aren&#39;t the major (47:55 - 47:59)
cities in Japan (47:58 - 48:03)
before yeah okay all right yeah I (47:59 - 48:05)
literally went to the fossil Museum I (48:03 - 48:08)
had to hike up a mountain for 45 minutes (48:05 - 48:10)
they gave me a wooden (48:08 - 48:13)
ticket and I didn&#39;t even get to keep (48:10 - 48:14)
[Laughter] (48:13 - 48:19)
it all right fair I&#39;m just saying there (48:14 - 48:24)
was no future here we were in the (48:19 - 48:26)
past you were on the past on the on a (48:24 - 48:28)
Pikachu train though I think that that&#39;s (48:26 - 48:31)
a Fair Trade Fair (48:28 - 48:35)
tradeoff yeah so they only sold 40 (48:31 - 48:40)
receipts I don&#39;t (48:35 - 48:40)
know how often the train runs like I (48:41 - 48:45)
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s like a weekend only (48:43 - 48:50)
train I think it is but when you get (48:45 - 48:52)
there you have to hand them your tickets (48:50 - 48:58)
no tap to pay and then (48:52 - 48:58)
they like cuz it was raining they had (48:58 - 49:04)
Pikachu umbrellas so I think it was only (49:01 - 49:06)
because it was raining we got that (49:04 - 49:08)
treatment but they like hold they like (49:06 - 49:10)
get out of the train like the conductor (49:08 - 49:16)
and like the what train assistant (49:10 - 49:18)
called the same as (49:16 - 49:21)
Airline attendance oh like like the (49:18 - 49:24)
attendance um they like held a huge (49:21 - 49:27)
Banner that was like welcome to the p (49:24 - 49:29)

ocean and it was an hour and 45 minutes (49:43 - 49:52)
mhm on this Pikachu train which sounds (49:47 - 49:54)
awesome and it (49:52 - 49:57)
was until you realize (49:54 - 49:59)
it takes an hour and 45 minutes to go (49:57 - 50:03)
back yeah was the way back also on the (49:59 - 50:06)
Pikachu train it was and I&#39;m very (50:03 - 50:09)

train it&#39;s yellow like the seats look (50:12 - 50:21)
like Pikachu so they&#39;re yellow and brown (50:16 - 50:23)
mhm and (50:21 - 50:28)
yellow doesn&#39;t hold up well over time (50:23 - 50:29)
right (50:28 - 50:32)
mhm and they definitely cleaned it when (50:29 - 50:34)
we got out like I watched like they (50:32 - 50:35)
closed the doors and you could see them (50:34 - 50:38)
wiping down things and I didn&#39;t see like (50:35 - 50:41)
a vacuum or anything like I didn&#39;t see a (50:38 - 50:43)
Dyson (50:41 - 50:46)
but it felt (50:43 - 50:50)
dirty yeah because (50:46 - 50:54)
like the yellow wasn&#39;t like bright (50:50 - 50:57)
yellow assuming it was Fabric and not (50:54 - 51:00)
plastic yeah it was a fabric seat it was (50:57 - 51:04)
like shiny Pikachu not regular (51:00 - 51:08)
Pikachu a shiny Pikachu color (51:04 - 51:08)
maybe so Japan&#39;s into stamps like most (51:11 - 51:21)
of the J Jr line there&#39;s stamps to and (51:16 - 51:22)
when you&#39;re talking stamps it&#39;s like (51:21 - 51:24)
stamping a thing in a stamp book not (51:22 - 51:27)
putting a stamp on a letter yes thank (51:24 - 51:30)
you Hannah so (51:27 - 51:32)
they there was a stamp right when you (51:30 - 51:33)
got to the (51:32 - 51:36)
station and they handed you a card with (51:33 - 51:38)
already that station stamp and then (51:36 - 51:39)
there was like three other stamps you (51:38 - 51:43)
could get and so the Pikachu train (51:39 - 51:45)
started there was a loudspeaker and (51:43 - 51:47)
Pikachu just like yelled at you in like (51:45 - 51:49)
pika pika (51:47 - 51:51)
voice and then as we approached the (51:49 - 51:53)
first stop they opened the door you got (51:51 - 51:56)
out and there was like nothing there (51:53 - 51:59)
like you literally just got out and was (51:56 - 52:02)
like we&#39;re in the middle of nowhere mhm (51:59 - 52:05)
there&#39;s there&#39;s one vending machine no (52:02 - 52:09)
bathroom no ST nothing to do here no (52:05 - 52:11)
pokey Lids a that&#39;s a that&#39;s a missed (52:09 - 52:14)
opportunity right there so we get back (52:11 - 52:16)
in hold on what was the stop (52:14 - 52:19)
four no nothing we just (52:16 - 52:25)
stopped but it was just like the next (52:19 - 52:28)
city are okay sorry let&#39;s back this it (52:25 - 52:31)
was a legitimate station that people (52:28 - 52:34)
could get on or off at okay but you (52:31 - 52:35)
can&#39;t get on the Pikachu train without (52:34 - 52:38)
the Pikachu ticket but do people like (52:35 - 52:39)
there are there is there anyone who (52:38 - 52:41)
takes the Pikachu train regularly like (52:39 - 52:43)
is that a train that oh no you don&#39;t (52:41 - 52:44)
know how often you said you don&#39;t know (52:43 - 52:46)
how often it actually runs right so no (52:44 - 52:48)
you have to buy a very special ticket (52:46 - 52:50)
for it so I don&#39;t think regular people (52:48 - 52:52)
are being like ah I got the Pikachu (52:50 - 52:55)
train this morning for work right I just (52:52 - 52:57)
so I just it (52:55 - 52:59)
it makes me wonder why they stopped (52:57 - 53:01)
unless they they have to like unless (52:59 - 53:02)
it&#39;s like just because it&#39;s the rules of (53:01 - 53:07)
the road or something yeah maybe oh (53:02 - 53:10)
maybe like timing for other trains like (53:07 - 53:13)
we have to stop yeah yeah so we get to (53:10 - 53:16)
the so after the first stop they then go (53:13 - 53:18)
on the announcement and they go like the (53:16 - 53:21)
playroom is (53:18 - 53:21)
opening and they open the playroom which (53:21 - 53:30)
imagine a train car with no seats but (53:25 - 53:37)
all fabric but that yellow fabric oh (53:30 - 53:41)
no and then imagine a bunch of pika (53:37 - 53:43)
pikachu (53:41 - 53:45)
plushes (53:43 - 53:48)
that maybe have been (53:45 - 53:52)
[Laughter] (53:48 - 53:52)
cleaned but proba but didn&#39;t look clean (53:52 - 53:58)
that sounds like an experience that was (53:59 - 54:05)
the that was the second train car and it (54:02 - 54:08)
kind of sucked it was just Pikachu (54:05 - 54:13)
plushes yeah how many Pikachu plushes a (54:08 - 54:15)
lot (54:13 - 54:19)
like I&#39;m so confused right now why this (54:15 - 54:25)
is so there was 40 people and like 300 (54:19 - 54:28)
Pikachu on this train (54:25 - 54:30)
uh if I was to count the plushes there (54:28 - 54:33)
was probably like 40 Pikachu plushes in (54:30 - 54:35)
this room (54:33 - 54:40)
one different sizes (54:35 - 54:40)
MH and there&#39;s like a little ball pit (54:41 - 54:46)
with just yellow (54:45 - 54:49)
balls was there a the van go (54:46 - 54:52)
plush these it was it was all the same (54:49 - 54:56)
Pikachu plush except for two of them one (54:52 - 54:57)
was like (54:56 - 54:59)
much (54:57 - 55:05)
bigger like $400 size picture bigger and (54:59 - 55:07)
then one was like really big where (55:05 - 55:09)
you&#39;re supposed to like sit on it like (55:07 - 55:12)
straddle Pikachu and then you get like a (55:09 - 55:16)
picture as you&#39;re like riding (55:12 - 55:20)
them there&#39;s maybe a picture of me (55:16 - 55:22)
straddling (55:20 - 55:24)
Pikachu but everyone did everyone got a (55:22 - 55:28)
turn on Pikachu (55:24 - 55:28)
it was the (55:29 - 55:33)
playroom yep it sure (55:30 - 55:35)
[Laughter] (55:33 - 55:40)
was I was hesitant to straddle Pikachu (55:35 - 55:44)
because he just seemed (55:40 - 55:44)
dirty like like I don&#39;t know how to this (55:44 - 55:51)
conversation I don&#39;t know how to express (55:48 - 55:55)
how a fabric room on a (55:51 - 56:00)
train Maybe not the most hygienic (55:55 - 56:00)
Rune the other Pokemon I&#39;ve seen (56:02 - 56:07)
pictures of are full of plastic Pokemon (56:05 - 56:10)
things that makes the fact that this is (56:07 - 56:12)
all fabric is a (56:10 - 56:14)
lot (56:12 - 56:18)
um so okay still trying to process that (56:14 - 56:20)
last minute and a half of conversation (56:18 - 56:24)
that just happened uh so okay so is this (56:20 - 56:27)
train (56:24 - 56:27)
anyway so let&#39;s clear this up right now (56:29 - 56:36)
is this train anyway um sponsored by the (56:32 - 56:37)
Pokemon company or connected is it the (56:36 - 56:40)
Pokemon company an official Pokemon (56:37 - 56:42)
train I&#39;m that&#39;s just so surprising that (56:40 - 56:43)
they (56:42 - 56:46)
wouldn&#39;t I mean maybe they do but like (56:43 - 56:48)
wouldn&#39;t switch out like the plushes and (56:46 - 56:51)
stuff more often if it was like I would (56:48 - 56:52)
imagine I would understand if it was (56:51 - 56:56)
some like local train that&#39;s not a 95 (56:52 - 56:59)
bill billion dollar like Revenue company (56:56 - 57:02)
overall like I I would get it but (56:59 - 57:04)
Pokemon I feel like they (57:02 - 57:07)
could switch out those plushes and maybe (57:04 - 57:12)
not have I mean what seems like old (57:07 - 57:14)
plushes in there that people are playing (57:12 - 57:17)
with I want to know how old it is it (57:14 - 57:22)
looks like it was updated in 2017 that&#39;s (57:17 - 57:25)
true very true yeah I&#39;m looking at (57:22 - 57:26)
pictures of it it looks like it was (57:25 - 57:29)
updated in (57:26 - 57:29)
2017 and first created in 2012 (57:29 - 57:36)
so they&#39;ve been they&#39;ve been working (57:33 - 57:37)
with the fame fabric (57:36 - 57:43)
for seven years there were (57:37 - 57:43)
no okay so when you looked at the (57:44 - 57:49)
ceiling there (57:46 - 57:51)
were there&#39;s not fabric on the ceiling (57:49 - 57:56)
there was like lights running along the (57:51 - 57:58)
ceiling mhm (57:56 - 58:03)
um and they had Silhouettes Of Legendary (57:58 - 58:05)
Pokemon or starter Pokemon so that was (58:03 - 58:08)
like Reggie gigas Rayquaza Mewtwo (58:05 - 58:11)
Greninja Del Fox Blastoise Squirtle Char (58:08 - 58:13)
Blastoise Charizard Venusaur there&#39;s (58:11 - 58:16)
nothing after Gen (58:13 - 58:21)
6 okay so there was no disi or instant (58:16 - 58:26)
AAR on the ceiling (58:21 - 58:26)
and okay here&#39;s the here&#39;s the scam (58:27 - 58:34)
part they they came through and offered (58:30 - 58:36)
ice cream that you could buy they had (58:34 - 58:39)
two flavors that&#39;s not that weird cuz if (58:36 - 58:41)
you&#39;ve ever ridden the bullet train (58:39 - 58:43)
they&#39;ll come through with like waffles (58:41 - 58:45)
or ice cream or whatever and sell it to (58:43 - 58:47)
you on their little credit card it&#39;s (58:45 - 58:49)
like an (58:47 - 58:49)
airplane the part that really like made (58:50 - 58:56)
me laugh out loud and I had to hold it (58:53 - 58:59)
in is the walk through with Pokemon (58:56 - 59:03)
merch not exclusive merch just like (58:59 - 59:05)
literally merch you can get like (59:03 - 59:07)
anywhere and they&#39;re like do you want to (59:05 - 59:11)
buy this Captain Pikachu (59:07 - 59:11)
plushy and they walk through multiple (59:11 - 59:16)
times with like you can buy Pokemon (59:14 - 59:19)
merch here not but nothing (59:16 - 59:22)
exclusive this sounds like a better (59:19 - 59:26)
thing for kids than for adults (59:22 - 59:26)
this whole (59:27 - 59:31)
experience the whole thing so because I (59:28 - 59:33)
could imagine being a kid and getting a (59:31 - 59:35)
plushy there and feeling really special (59:33 - 59:37)
about it because I got it on the Pikachu (59:35 - 59:39)
train experience but as an adult knowing (59:37 - 59:41)
that you can just get that at Pokemon (59:39 - 59:46)
Center y yeah yeah and I mean honestly (59:41 - 59:48)
like just being on a Pikachu train in (59:46 - 59:49)
the first place that seems much more (59:48 - 59:53)
like it might appeal to like (59:49 - 59:58)
it but what yeah but I feel like adults (59:53 - 60:00)
might get over that in a few minutes (59:58 - 60:03)
whereas um kids May that might be like (60:00 - 60:05)
something that they&#39;re super into like (60:03 - 60:07)
the entire as somebody with kids who (60:05 - 60:10)
likes train who like trains I like I (60:07 - 60:12)
could I could definitely imagine that (60:10 - 60:14)
they would like absolutely love that um (60:12 - 60:15)
I don&#39;t know how i&#39; feel about them with (60:14 - 60:16)
playing with all the (60:15 - 60:19)
plushies so like 40 other people are (60:16 - 60:21)
also playing with all the plushies but (60:19 - 60:25)
you know is what it is so our our ride (60:21 - 60:27)
there (60:25 - 60:33)
um there were other adults not with kids (60:27 - 60:36)
I would say I was an adult with no (60:33 - 60:39)
kids (60:36 - 60:39)
right and they seem to be having a good (60:40 - 60:44)
time except for (60:42 - 60:48)
one she was 100% American I&#39;m profiling (60:44 - 60:49)
her she could have been Canadian but she (60:48 - 60:51)
seemed way too rude to be Canadian so (60:49 - 60:54)
I&#39;m going to say she was American for (60:51 - 60:57)
sure she was not with anyone else cuz (60:54 - 61:00)
she was sitting by herself surrounded by (60:57 - 61:03)
Japanese people well like I went in a (61:00 - 61:05)
group of three so we had like one (61:03 - 61:08)
Japanese grandma that was assigned to us (61:05 - 61:10)
but that&#39;s because like they went in a (61:08 - 61:13)
group of five wait hold (61:10 - 61:17)
on you what so like it it was groups of (61:13 - 61:19)
four the seats were facing each other (61:17 - 61:23)
okay and every seat sold out got it so (61:19 - 61:27)
it was mom dad two kids grandma (61:23 - 61:30)
oh grandma got put with our group of (61:27 - 61:33)
three an actual Grandma I I see what (61:30 - 61:34)
you&#39;re saying (61:33 - 61:37)
like Grandma who was Northern grandma (61:34 - 61:39)
could have been an East Grandma possibly (61:37 - 61:43)
a West but in this case a northern (61:39 - 61:46)
grandma got (61:43 - 61:46)
it so there was (61:47 - 61:54)
another there&#39;s another group of three (61:50 - 61:58)
and then that American (61:54 - 61:58)
girl and she was probably close to my (61:58 - 62:02)
age like (62:01 - 62:06)
not early 20s again I&#39;m really profiling (62:02 - 62:09)
her but she looked like she was having a (62:06 - 62:12)
miserable time not because of the (62:09 - 62:15)
Pikachu train I think she was annoyed (62:12 - 62:18)
that everyone including myself was like (62:15 - 62:22)
filming and taking pictures and like it (62:18 - 62:24)
really gave like anytime I like pulled (62:22 - 62:26)
out my camera or my like (62:24 - 62:28)
my (62:26 - 62:31)
DJI like it was like eye rolling to her (62:28 - 62:35)
just judgy yeah (62:31 - 62:35)
yes (62:36 - 62:43)
um but she was there by herself there (62:39 - 62:45)
was no kids there was a lot of kids I (62:43 - 62:49)
would say out of the 40 people 20 were (62:45 - 62:52)
kids 20 were (62:49 - 62:56)
adults and half of those adults (62:52 - 63:00)
definitely fell asleep during said train (62:56 - 63:03)
ride of like send the kids into the (63:00 - 63:08)
playroom mhh we&#39;re going to (63:03 - 63:08)
sleep so we stopped like seven times (63:08 - 63:16)
whoa and cuz there was like Seven Cities (63:12 - 63:20)
it it was like the normal route sure (63:16 - 63:23)
and the F the second or third stop there (63:20 - 63:26)
was the stamp so we got out walk walked (63:23 - 63:28)
over to the station went in got the (63:26 - 63:31)
stamp they did (63:28 - 63:31)
have at one of the stations one of the (63:31 - 63:37)
stamp stations like somebody there with (63:34 - 63:42)
a huge camera with like a super big lens (63:37 - 63:43)
and as soon as we got off the train and (63:42 - 63:45)
we were walking they were like snapping (63:43 - 63:48)
a bunch of photos of us and I was like (63:45 - 63:49)
that&#39;s (63:48 - 63:53)
weird and then the people on the train (63:49 - 63:56)
were like chitchatting with him and I (63:53 - 63:58)
was like oh and then I saw he had like a (63:56 - 64:01)
Pikachu train sticker on his camera as I (63:58 - 64:05)
got closer and I was like oh you must be (64:01 - 64:08)
part part of the whole experience yeah (64:05 - 64:11)
yeah Y and so I wonder if they use those (64:08 - 64:14)
pictures to like advertise I&#39;m sure when (64:11 - 64:16)
we bought the tickets there was some (64:14 - 64:19)
like disclosure in (64:16 - 64:21)
Japanese well that woman must have hated (64:19 - 64:23)
that if she came off the train and had (64:21 - 64:27)
her picture had her picture potentially (64:23 - 64:28)
Tak (64:27 - 64:32)
so uh every station that had a stamp (64:28 - 64:33)
also had a (64:32 - 64:37)
huge acrylic statue of (64:33 - 64:41)
Pikachu and then some stations had no (64:37 - 64:44)
stamp but had different acrylics like (64:41 - 64:46)
there was a station that just had a (64:44 - 64:50)
giant acrylic CIO and it was really cool (64:46 - 64:53)
to like see a giant CIO and run out (64:50 - 64:55)
there and then there was another station (64:53 - 64:59)
that had had a like a hedge a bush that (64:55 - 65:02)
was like carved into Pikachu and then (64:59 - 65:03)
the other one was like (65:02 - 65:06)
Snivy it&#39;s just Pikachu and Snivy (65:03 - 65:12)
there&#39;s no aswat or t pig at all on just (65:06 - 65:15)
just Snivy yeah sounds like Snivy was (65:12 - 65:17)
that station&#39;s (65:15 - 65:21)
Pokemon yeah um so we would sometimes we (65:17 - 65:24)
would stop and there would be something (65:21 - 65:29)
to take a picture of like Snivy or CIO (65:24 - 65:31)
sometimes we would stop there would be (65:29 - 65:33)
nothing and then sometimes we would stop (65:31 - 65:34)
there would be the (65:33 - 65:37)
stamp um and then like all the signs the (65:34 - 65:40)
train signs had Pikachu on them being (65:37 - 65:45)
like Pikachu train runs here MH (65:40 - 65:47)
and before we got the last station they (65:45 - 65:49)
like closed the (65:47 - 65:53)
playroom and now imagine 20 kids on a (65:49 - 65:56)
plane sorry train (65:53 - 65:59)
and them being like playroom (65:56 - 66:01)
closed and it&#39;s going to take us 10 (65:59 - 66:04)
minutes to get to the next station and (66:01 - 66:08)
it&#39;s non-stop crying for 10 minutes (66:04 - 66:12)
mhm because they&#39;re all upset the play (66:08 - 66:14)
room is now (66:12 - 66:18)
closed yep yep that&#39;s I mean I get it (66:14 - 66:21)
you got to do it (66:18 - 66:21)
miserable cuz (66:22 - 66:27)
honestly like you go into the playroom (66:24 - 66:29)
it sucks cuz everyone wants to go to (66:27 - 66:32)
like see it cuz they close it off and (66:29 - 66:34)
then you get like your picture (66:32 - 66:36)
opportunities and you come back and then (66:34 - 66:39)
it&#39;s like a Scenic very like nice ride (66:36 - 66:41)
and you get off and you take pictures (66:39 - 66:44)
and you get back on and it&#39;s great and (66:41 - 66:49)
then you realize that your car is quiet (66:44 - 66:51)
cuz all of the children are in the other (66:49 - 66:54)
car MH and when they came back in you&#39;re (66:51 - 66:58)
just like let me off this (66:54 - 67:05)
ride it&#39;s been an hour and a half I won (66:58 - 67:05)
off so we get to the final (67:06 - 67:11)
station you get your final (67:09 - 67:14)
stamp um you have to like hand in your (67:11 - 67:17)
tickets they do at one point like stamp (67:14 - 67:19)
your tickets on the train and it&#39;s like (67:17 - 67:22)
a Pikachu stamp which is like really (67:19 - 67:25)
cute and there&#39;s like bonus stamp and (67:22 - 67:28)
then there&#39;s like a pamphlet being like (67:25 - 67:32)
there&#39;s more stamps in this town and the (67:28 - 67:34)
it shows you like a map of where to get (67:32 - 67:38)
them and our next train back wasn&#39;t for (67:34 - 67:40)
90 (67:38 - 67:43)
minutes and the other two adults that we (67:40 - 67:46)
kind of like semi-connected with cuz (67:43 - 67:48)
Julie can speak (67:46 - 67:52)
Japanese and Portuguese but not English (67:48 - 67:56)
so it was Julie speaking Japanese and (67:52 - 67:58)
then me translating Portuguese and then (67:56 - 68:00)
turning that into Portuguese and then (67:58 - 68:05)
talking to me it was a mess she&#39;s great (68:00 - 68:07)
though they were (68:05 - 68:11)
like there&#39;s a pokey lid and we&#39;re going (68:07 - 68:13)
to go to it and the thing okay so the (68:11 - 68:15)
thing we noticed when we got off the (68:13 - 68:18)
train is half the (68:15 - 68:20)
people got on bikes right away there&#39;s (68:18 - 68:23)
just a bunch of bikes there mhm with (68:20 - 68:24)
like in (68:23 - 68:28)
America usually you see the bike at like (68:24 - 68:30)
the bottom of a river because the (68:28 - 68:32)
Americans were like let&#39;s throw it off a (68:30 - 68:36)
bridge yep that&#39;s fun sound about right (68:32 - 68:39)
or but like you have to pay for (68:36 - 68:42)
it maybe they paid for it but a bunch of (68:39 - 68:44)
people just got on bikes and started (68:42 - 68:47)
going and I was like that&#39;s (68:44 - 68:50)
weird that&#39;s everyone&#39;s have like (68:47 - 68:53)
they&#39;re clearly the station&#39;s (68:50 - 68:56)
bikes and then the two (68:53 - 69:00)
girls were like we&#39;re going to get a at (68:56 - 69:01)
some point it was discussed that they&#39;re (69:00 - 69:04)
getting into a taxi to go to the Lapras (69:01 - 69:08)
Pokey lid mhm and we&#39;re like cool we&#39;re (69:04 - 69:10)
going to get in the taxi behind you and (69:08 - 69:12)
also go to the Pokey lid because it&#39;s (69:10 - 69:14)
only a th000 (69:12 - 69:18)
Yen and I don&#39;t want to get on a bike I (69:14 - 69:20)
don&#39;t (69:18 - 69:22)
know so we did (69:20 - 69:26)
that and it&#39;s like a really cute side (69:22 - 69:29)
Town it was the Lapras and Geodude Pokey (69:26 - 69:32)
lid and there was like four restaurants (69:29 - 69:35)
like right there and so we just like (69:32 - 69:37)
walked outside and checked the (69:35 - 69:39)
menu and was like okay well just go to (69:37 - 69:41)
this one and the one we ended up going (69:39 - 69:43)
to she could have been lying to us she (69:41 - 69:46)
was like this sweet old Japanese lady (69:43 - 69:51)
but she was like asking why we were (69:46 - 69:52)
there and we were like (69:51 - 69:54)
Pokémon and she was like oh and as we (69:52 - 69:56)
were leaving cuz she called us a (69:54 - 70:00)
taxi to pick us up she was (69:56 - 70:05)
like satoshi&#39;s voice actor has eatting (70:00 - 70:07)
here and that was like I don&#39;t know why (70:05 - 70:11)
you would lie about that but that&#39;s (70:07 - 70:13)
cool that&#39;s (70:11 - 70:17)
like neat little trivia about your (70:13 - 70:20)
restaurant so what I don&#39;t get is I (70:17 - 70:24)
expected us to take a train back because (70:20 - 70:27)
it was an hour 45 Pikachu train there (70:24 - 70:32)
and we watched it leave like we got off (70:27 - 70:33)
they shut their doors we watched them (70:32 - 70:36)
clean it and then they left and no one (70:33 - 70:41)
was on it mhm and I was kind of confused (70:36 - 70:43)
why cuz Julie booked our tickets why (70:41 - 70:46)
Julie booked our tickets almost two (70:43 - 70:49)
hours later like oh now we&#39;re stuck in (70:46 - 70:53)
the cide town mhm with Julie&#39;s no (70:49 - 70:56)
civilization for two hours whole town (70:53 - 70:58)
has like four (70:56 - 71:01)
restaurants you now live (70:58 - 71:04)
there and yeah we now live (71:01 - 71:06)
here and so when we got off the train (71:04 - 71:08)
half the people took bikes and then the (71:06 - 71:10)
other half of the people like sat down (71:08 - 71:12)
at the (71:10 - 71:14)
station and then when we got back they (71:12 - 71:16)
were gone so they (71:14 - 71:21)
clearly got on a train and left but it (71:16 - 71:23)
couldn&#39;t have been the Pikachu (71:21 - 71:27)
train because the Pikachu came train was (71:23 - 71:29)
there when we got there two hours (71:27 - 71:34)
later MH and it was the same train and I (71:29 - 71:37)
know this because there was a master (71:34 - 71:40)
ball on the train and it had a huge dent (71:37 - 71:41)
in (71:40 - 71:46)
it and it was the same master ball with (71:41 - 71:50)
the same Dent MH this is the beginning (71:46 - 71:54)
to like a thriller movie like I just (71:50 - 71:56)
where did the people go like I mean the (71:54 - 71:58)
train probably just has to keep (71:56 - 72:01)
moving so if you don&#39;t want to get back (71:58 - 72:03)
on it two hours later you can probably (72:01 - 72:05)
just take a normal train back and not (72:03 - 72:08)
pay as much for your tickets yeah but (72:05 - 72:09)
there was no way it could have gotten (72:08 - 72:12)
back and then got back to us in an hour (72:09 - 72:16)
45 well and I were this was it how many (72:12 - 72:17)
people were on the train on the way back (72:16 - 72:20)
was it still full no that was the weird (72:17 - 72:25)
part okay is on the way back some of us (72:20 - 72:29)
were on the train like (72:25 - 72:32)
maybe one4 of us that were on the first (72:29 - 72:34)
train were on the second train but then (72:32 - 72:38)
there were new people on the train but (72:34 - 72:41)
the train wasn&#39;t full it was maybe like (72:38 - 72:44)
30 out of 40 people and 20 people were (72:41 - 72:45)
new and there was 10 people that were (72:44 - 72:48)
old there was less kids that was (72:45 - 72:52)
cool and we went (72:48 - 72:54)
back and that was also cool cuz it was (72:52 - 72:58)
like oh we can get more photos and (72:54 - 72:58)
everything but what happened to everyone (72:58 - 73:04)
else first off how did the people in (73:01 - 73:07)
this middle of nowhere (73:04 - 73:12)
Town decide I&#39;m getting on the Pikachu (73:07 - 73:16)
train and then they have to go back it&#39;s (73:12 - 73:17)
very inconvenient this is the point of (73:16 - 73:20)
the whole thing you have to go so far (73:17 - 73:24)
out of the way to get to this train to (73:20 - 73:27)
then take a 2hour train to (73:24 - 73:31)
nowhere and there there is nothing there (73:27 - 73:33)
to then take the 2hour train back to (73:31 - 73:37)
then take three hours back to Tokyo (73:33 - 73:38)
that&#39;s that&#39;s it that&#39;s the whole (73:37 - 73:41)
experience I can&#39;t wait for the plot (73:38 - 73:44)
twist where someone comments and they&#39;re (73:41 - 73:47)
like there is no Pikachu train that (73:44 - 73:50)
train Clos closed down 10 years ago I&#39;m (73:47 - 73:54)
not sure what Steve was traveling on I (73:50 - 73:58)
think I think the Pikachu train is cool (73:54 - 74:02)
and I&#39;m so glad I did it 4 hours on this (73:58 - 74:06)
train is to much Pikachu (74:02 - 74:06)
train um okay if we can back up to the (74:07 - 74:13)
playroom real quick (74:11 - 74:16)
cuz I gota like I think I got to fully (74:13 - 74:20)
understand this so it was a train car (74:16 - 74:22)
that literally just had Pikachu plushes (74:20 - 74:25)
in it and nothing else yes it looks like (74:22 - 74:27)
were a couple of chairs at least in the (74:25 - 74:31)
photos yeah there&#39;s (74:27 - 74:31)
like like the kind of the chairs you see (74:32 - 74:39)
in Mall malls they&#39;re like you can sit (74:34 - 74:41)
on them but they&#39;re not like (74:39 - 74:44)
comfortable mhm yeah yeah and it&#39;s all (74:41 - 74:46)
very very yellow and there are still (74:44 - 74:48)
Windows cuz it&#39;s still a train so it&#39;s (74:46 - 74:50)
not just a fully completely yellow (74:48 - 74:55)
everywhere room yellow box yellow tinted (74:50 - 74:57)
windows (74:55 - 74:57)
you just go crazy in (74:57 - 75:00)
it okay well that&#39;s I&#39;m glad you had (75:02 - 75:08)
that experience at least what yeah I I (75:05 - 75:10)
have just so many question I have more (75:08 - 75:12)
questions about the Pikachu train after (75:10 - 75:15)
riding it then I did going to it (75:12 - 75:18)
like where did those people go what (75:15 - 75:21)
train did they take why did we get two (75:18 - 75:25)
Pikachu rides and they didn&#39;t how did (75:21 - 75:27)
people make it to the seaside town and (75:25 - 75:29)
then decide they&#39;re going to take the (75:27 - 75:33)
Pikachu train out of this (75:29 - 75:37)
town why is it only two cars they could (75:33 - 75:40)
sell more tickets and just add an extra (75:37 - 75:42)
car (75:40 - 75:44)
well (75:42 - 75:48)
maybe people (75:44 - 75:48)
also did it seem like anyone had luggage (75:48 - 75:52)
like maybe people vacation at that (75:51 - 75:55)
Seaside town like is there any place to (75:52 - 75:57)
and so they stay up there and then come (75:55 - 76:00)
back like in a different time you know (75:57 - 76:03)
no luggage but I will say drama alert (76:00 - 76:05)
this what I will say I&#39;m going to (76:03 - 76:07)
profile people again okay there were two (76:05 - 76:09)
French people on the (76:07 - 76:12)
train on the way back they were (76:09 - 76:14)
definitely French 100% because they (76:12 - 76:16)
spoke (76:14 - 76:18)
French okay I guess they could have been (76:16 - 76:20)
Canadian Julie spoke Portuguese that&#39;s (76:18 - 76:24)
true but Julie lives in (76:20 - 76:24)
Japan that&#39;s in the okay (76:24 - 76:30)
sure sure yeah I (76:27 - 76:33)
guess in the (76:30 - 76:35)
playroom you know how I said there was (76:33 - 76:36)
like a ball (76:35 - 76:41)
pit oh no yes they were throwing the (76:36 - 76:44)
ball pit balls at each (76:41 - 76:46)
other and the guy accidentally threw it (76:44 - 76:50)
too hard missed his significant other (76:46 - 76:55)
and hit a kid in the head oh no (76:50 - 76:58)
and then at that point they decided to (76:55 - 77:04)
stop throwing the play ball the playroom (76:58 - 77:04)
balls oops but these are like Whiffle (77:04 - 77:11)
balls not like baseballs like the ones (77:09 - 77:15)
you like ball pit yeah ball balls but I (77:11 - 77:18)
was like why are we throwing Whiffle why (77:15 - 77:20)
are we throwing (77:18 - 77:22)
these yeah (77:20 - 77:25)
that&#39;s and approximately okay we&#39;re not (77:22 - 77:27)
going to go with like exactly how old (77:25 - 77:28)
these people were but we&#39;re they were (77:27 - 77:30)
adults (77:28 - 77:33)
right he had a bold (77:30 - 77:36)
spot oh they were okay not they weren&#39;t (77:33 - 77:38)
children they weren&#39;t little children is (77:36 - 77:41)
what I was get gu (77:38 - 77:41)
no very curious if ball pits are a thing (77:42 - 77:48)
outside of America most of the at all (77:45 - 77:50)
very much I mean clearly this was (77:48 - 77:54)
independ but I&#39;m very curious how often (77:50 - 77:56)
they clean this train (77:54 - 77:59)
like I I watch them wipe it down I&#39;m (77:56 - 78:03)
talking like vacuum (77:59 - 78:06)
and steam clean the carpet yeah steam (78:03 - 78:09)
clean steam clean steam (78:06 - 78:12)
clean like I want to know how often the (78:09 - 78:15)
seats are steam (78:12 - 78:15)
cleaned I don&#39;t know I have so many (78:15 - 78:20)
questions about this (78:18 - 78:24)
train you got to get a a employee of the (78:20 - 78:26)
Train on podcast you&#39;re saying you&#39;re (78:24 - 78:28)
glad that you went and then you&#39;re also (78:26 - 78:29)
saying it was a (78:28 - 78:34)
mistake a mistake because I have more (78:29 - 78:36)
questions I&#39;m so (78:34 - 78:39)
confused how this operation (78:36 - 78:43)
runs I&#39;m I mean I think people probably (78:39 - 78:45)
just choose the train ride they want to (78:43 - 78:48)
be on and you got two (78:45 - 78:50)
tickets and and sometimes if people want (78:48 - 78:54)
to be on the 11:00 a.m. train they have (78:50 - 78:55)
to take a different train out to catch (78:54 - 78:58)
the Pikachu train (78:55 - 79:00)
back that&#39;s what (78:58 - 79:06)
seems right in my mind I don&#39;t (79:00 - 79:06)
know yeah (79:07 - 79:13)
there&#39;s none of the stops we went (79:09 - 79:15)
to do you know how like well you you&#39;ve (79:13 - 79:18)
both been to Japan right mhm MH so like (79:15 - 79:19)
when you&#39;re when you&#39;re going around (79:18 - 79:23)
like Tokyo you&#39;re like shabuya (79:19 - 79:25)
haruku uh (79:23 - 79:27)
the Tokyo (79:25 - 79:31)
uneno like akih Habra right and then you (79:27 - 79:34)
know how like there&#39;s a couple stops in (79:31 - 79:36)
between and you&#39;re like I&#39;ve never (79:34 - 79:40)
gotten off there or like no one gets off (79:36 - 79:43)
here like the do&#39;s open no one gets on (79:40 - 79:44)
no one gets off but like obviously if (79:43 - 79:46)
you go to shabuya million people are (79:44 - 79:48)
getting on million people are getting (79:46 - 79:51)
off sure so you&#39;re like oh these cities (79:48 - 79:55)
in between of like uneno and akih Habra (79:51 - 79:57)
probably not a city worth (79:55 - 80:01)
visiting or like not a neighborhood yeah (79:57 - 80:03)
neighbor neighborhood I mean gotten off (80:01 - 80:06)
at some of those stations when I lived (80:03 - 80:09)
in Tokyo for a couple of weeks back in (80:06 - 80:11)
2016 and they&#39;re just (80:09 - 80:14)
neighborhoods there there a bunch like (80:11 - 80:17)
yeah all the stations for the Pikachu (80:14 - 80:21)
train were like you got off and you&#39;re (80:17 - 80:26)
just like there&#39;s literally nothing (80:21 - 80:29)
like a normal train runs this Route M (80:26 - 80:31)
yeah but who&#39;s who&#39;s getting off and (80:29 - 80:35)
who&#39;s like there are people totally yeah (80:31 - 80:38)
who did anyone get off the Pikachu train (80:35 - 80:41)
at any stop other than the seat like the (80:38 - 80:43)
end no and not get back on I wouldn&#39;t (80:41 - 80:46)
expect anyone to a new question though (80:43 - 80:50)
but okay how many people are getting (80:46 - 80:54)
off and the Pikachu train leaves without (80:50 - 80:57)
them that&#39;s the other question I have go (80:54 - 80:59)
back on a different (80:57 - 81:01)
train because they didn&#39;t buy two (80:59 - 81:03)
tickets like you did I&#39;m pretty sure (81:01 - 81:05)
that&#39;s the situation I&#39;m saying I&#39;m (81:03 - 81:07)
saying the middle of it yeah like in the (81:05 - 81:10)
middle of it like they got (81:07 - 81:13)
off to like take a picture of Celio and (81:10 - 81:16)
then went to the bathroom Okay and then (81:13 - 81:18)
they get out of the bathroom and the (81:16 - 81:21)
Train&#39;s gone there&#39;s no way that doesn&#39;t (81:18 - 81:23)
happen yeah yeah I&#39;m sure it happens (81:21 - 81:25)
yeah totally like people are people (81:23 - 81:29)
so I&#39;m sure that that absolutely (81:25 - 81:32)
happened (81:29 - 81:34)
um now I feel like I have to go take the (81:32 - 81:37)
train so that I (81:34 - 81:39)
can maybe get more answers to these (81:37 - 81:41)
questions that you have which will only (81:39 - 81:43)
lead to more questions that I will have (81:41 - 81:45)
I&#39;m assuming I think I&#39;m good some you (81:43 - 81:47)
should look up you someone&#39;s going to be (81:45 - 81:49)
like you should look up what ticket you (81:47 - 81:51)
bought I don&#39;t want to know I want all (81:49 - 81:53)
the Mysteries to stay I don&#39;t want to I (81:51 - 81:55)
don&#39;t even know how much the train was (81:53 - 81:58)
because you can&#39;t buy it unless you live (81:55 - 82:00)
in Japan there&#39;s not like a website you (81:58 - 82:03)
can go to so Julie bought the tickets (82:00 - 82:04)
and I was like how much was it Julie and (82:03 - 82:06)
she was like don&#39;t worry about it I (82:04 - 82:08)
don&#39;t even know how much it was to ride (82:06 - 82:10)
this (82:08 - 82:10)
train it&#39;s a mystery yep you would have (82:12 - 82:18)
paid twice as much you got all the (82:15 - 82:18)
answers I recorded a lot of video though (82:19 - 82:25)
so maybe I&#39;ll turn into a YouTube video (82:22 - 82:29)
it&#39;s a wild ride make it (82:25 - 82:29)
mysterious you won&#39;t believe what happen (82:30 - 82:35)
on this train (82:33 - 82:35)
ride it was (82:38 - 82:46)
cool that&#39;s great glad you I saw Pokey (82:41 - 82:46)
lid all for the Pokey liid is okay so (82:47 - 82:54)
actually that leads to another question (82:51 - 82:57)
the Pokey liid was in this was in this (82:54 - 83:00)
Seaside town that the was the (82:57 - 83:02)
essentially the final destination of (83:00 - 83:04)
this Pikachu train right there wasn&#39;t it (83:02 - 83:06)
didn&#39;t go any further it went to the (83:04 - 83:08)
seaside town and then you said it (83:06 - 83:10)
like took there wasn&#39;t where anywhere (83:08 - 83:13)
for else for it to go right the Pikachu (83:10 - 83:16)
yeah so well it it it (83:13 - 83:18)
left but it went left back the other the (83:16 - 83:20)
way that it came right it didn&#39;t go to (83:18 - 83:23)
another like it didn&#39;t go further north (83:20 - 83:26)
or something like it didn&#39;t (83:23 - 83:27)
it probably just went to get out of the (83:26 - 83:30)
way of the other trains yeah because I (83:27 - 83:33)
think it just switched (83:30 - 83:40)
tracks sure yeah right to to go go back (83:33 - 83:42)
back to the original station and then (83:40 - 83:45)
come back to us right no I know my my (83:42 - 83:46)
question well this isn&#39;t even my (83:45 - 83:48)
question so now okay perfect this (83:46 - 83:51)
question is it did there wasn&#39;t another (83:48 - 83:53)
destination past the seaside Town though (83:51 - 83:57)
right it like oh yeah end of the line (83:53 - 83:59)
end of the line is what I mean like this (83:57 - 84:01)
town was the end of the line for okay so (83:59 - 84:03)
my question (84:01 - 84:06)
is is that really the only way people (84:03 - 84:07)
are getting up there to see that Lapras (84:06 - 84:10)
Pokey liid (84:07 - 84:13)
like I mean clearly this small town has (84:10 - 84:17)
this like how how uh are the lids like (84:13 - 84:20)
everywhere like in all these different (84:17 - 84:22)
like small towns and and places and (84:20 - 84:23)
things like that like I know there all (84:22 - 84:25)
over Japan (84:23 - 84:26)
and they&#39;re not in the major cities (84:25 - 84:28)
though right because the idea is to have (84:26 - 84:30)
people like travel to places that aren&#39;t (84:28 - 84:33)
in the major cities or the major parts (84:30 - 84:34)
in the major (84:33 - 84:36)
neighborhoods yeah the concept of the (84:34 - 84:40)
Pokey Lids are to drive people outside (84:36 - 84:41)
of (84:40 - 84:46)
Tokyo right so I&#39;m just saying like do (84:41 - 84:47)
you think a lot of people take the (84:46 - 84:50)
Pikachu train specifically to go to the (84:47 - 84:54)
Lapras poke lid no I think people take (84:50 - 84:56)
the Pikachu train cuz it&#39;s a Pikachu (84:54 - 84:59)
train yeah and then it just happens that (84:56 - 85:00)
at the end of it there&#39;s one of the (84:59 - 85:04)
poids is in that place I&#39;m sure plenty (85:00 - 85:06)
of people drive to the Pokey (85:04 - 85:08)
liid or take other trains that aren&#39;t (85:06 - 85:12)
the Pikachu train right (85:08 - 85:15)
right (85:12 - 85:15)
I think Pokey Lids are so cool I (85:16 - 85:21)
absolutely love them I think they&#39;re (85:19 - 85:24)
fantastic I think I would love to see (85:21 - 85:26)
all of them (85:24 - 85:29)
I think the Pokey Lids are such a (85:26 - 85:32)
niche (85:29 - 85:32)
thing in like the grand scheme of like (85:32 - 85:37)
if you were coming to Japan for the (85:36 - 85:40)
first time you&#39;re probably overwhelmed (85:37 - 85:42)
with like what you could do like oh I (85:40 - 85:44)
got to go to akih Habra oh my gosh I got (85:42 - 85:46)
to see like shabuya Sky I got to go to (85:44 - 85:48)
Tokyo Tower I got to do the the Mario (85:46 - 85:50)
Kart thing which you shouldn&#39;t do cuz (85:48 - 85:52)
it&#39;s like really annoying obnoxious (85:50 - 85:54)
don&#39;t do that I I got to go to this (85:52 - 85:56)
restaurant go to and when you look at (85:54 - 85:59)
where the Pokey leids are they are out (85:56 - 86:00)
of the way (85:59 - 86:04)
mhm like the most convenient ones are in (86:00 - 86:08)
uneno and there&#39;s two and they&#39;re (86:04 - 86:10)
they&#39;re pretty easy to get to but like (86:08 - 86:12)
the only reason you would well the main (86:10 - 86:13)
reason I shouldn&#39;t say only the main (86:12 - 86:15)
reason you would go to like Uno would be (86:13 - 86:16)
like (86:15 - 86:20)
the the big Museum they have there cuz (86:16 - 86:22)
the Pokey liid is I think there&#39;s two (86:20 - 86:23)
museums like right across the street (86:22 - 86:25)
from each other but the poke that&#39;s are (86:23 - 86:27)
right there it&#39;s like a (86:25 - 86:29)
tyrant oh and it&#39;s like bronzer they&#39;re (86:27 - 86:33)
not even good ones tyrant&#39;s good bronzer (86:29 - 86:36)
Ty&#39;s good it&#39;s like bronzer ball toy I (86:33 - 86:39)
mean there&#39;s other stuff in Uno just (86:36 - 86:41)
yeah saying again I&#39;m just talking about (86:39 - 86:45)
big tourist things of like the (86:41 - 86:49)
museum I don&#39;t know anyone that&#39;s like I (86:45 - 86:52)
love Geodude and Lapras so much that I&#39;m (86:49 - 86:56)
going to go for someone who loves Lapras (86:52 - 86:58)
that much you know someone who loves (86:56 - 87:00)
Lapras that (86:58 - 87:03)
much there are oh there&#39;s yeah there (87:00 - 87:09)
like 16 Lapras poke Lees yeah each um (87:03 - 87:11)
are they divided by (87:09 - 87:13)
prefecture each section of Japan so I (87:11 - 87:14)
think (87:13 - 87:18)
Fukushima is fukushima&#39;s CH chansy yeah (87:14 - 87:19)
is all chy and so they&#39;re a bunch of (87:18 - 87:22)
chansy poke lits if I&#39;m remembering (87:19 - 87:26)
correctly I did not realize that (87:22 - 87:26)
is Lapras yeah got it okay and then like (87:27 - 87:35)
the city of May (87:32 - 87:37)
my is (87:35 - 87:42)
aswat MH and then something is slobo and (87:37 - 87:47)
then I a is Geodude yeah with the very (87:42 - 87:49)
famous (87:47 - 87:51)
Geodude character like the person who (87:49 - 87:53)
dresses up is a Geodude with the pants (87:51 - 87:56)
that look like the parent yeah pattern (87:53 - 87:58)
in Photoshop (87:56 - 88:02)
yes so like I&#39;m we&#39;re I&#39;m recording this (87:58 - 88:03)
podcast in (88:02 - 88:05)
Fukushima because all the hotels in (88:03 - 88:09)
Sendai sold out so I booked one a hotel (88:05 - 88:12)
in Fukushima and so the Bullet Train (88:09 - 88:15)
only takes 22 minutes to get to Cai so (88:12 - 88:17)
it&#39;s like not bad at all like literally (88:15 - 88:20)
it would take me like 22 minutes from my (88:17 - 88:25)
hotel in Tokyo to get to like shabuya m (88:20 - 88:28)
cuz you have to like go around this is (88:25 - 88:29)
not that (88:28 - 88:35)
bad but when I looked up chansy Pokey (88:29 - 88:37)
Lids like the closest one to my hotel (88:35 - 88:39)
was a 10-minute (88:37 - 88:42)
drive or a 30 minute (88:39 - 88:45)
walk mhm and when I was getting back (88:42 - 88:46)
from go Fest it&#39;s been dark so it&#39;s like (88:45 - 88:50)
I don&#39;t want to walk in the dark to see (88:46 - 88:53)
a manhole cover yeah plus some of the (88:50 - 88:55)
locations get closed off after dark for (88:53 - 88:58)
some of the pokets I have (88:55 - 89:01)
seen yeah makes sense y but there (88:58 - 89:04)
there&#39;s again I&#39;m like literally right (89:01 - 89:06)
next to fukushima&#39;s station it&#39;s (89:04 - 89:08)
literally one block (89:06 - 89:11)
away not even a block it&#39;s across the (89:08 - 89:14)
street and when I was like there&#39;s 18 I (89:11 - 89:15)
think (89:14 - 89:17)
chansy almost all of them are like an (89:15 - 89:20)
hour away they&#39;re not easy to get to you (89:17 - 89:23)
kind of need a car and you can&#39;t really (89:20 - 89:27)
do them all in one day even just in one (89:23 - 89:30)
prefecture yeah (89:27 - 89:32)
so are they (89:30 - 89:36)
for people that live in Japan more so (89:32 - 89:39)
than like tourist people then okay I I (89:36 - 89:44)
think so they do Boost the economy yeah (89:39 - 89:47)
I mean tourists will go out of their way (89:44 - 89:49)
but it&#39;s harder yeah sounds I mean it (89:47 - 89:51)
sounds like (89:49 - 89:56)
it yeah it&#39;s not convenient (89:51 - 89:58)
so you just saw the one then while you (89:56 - 89:59)
were there this (89:58 - 90:03)
time uh so first one the Lapras and (89:59 - 90:06)
Geodude won at the end of the Pikachu (90:03 - 90:08)
train but again there was like (90:06 - 90:12)
a stamp thing you could do in that town (90:08 - 90:15)
mhm so in in the station there was like (90:12 - 90:20)
another map with more stamps and the map (90:15 - 90:21)
showed you where to get the stamps but (90:20 - 90:24)
we didn&#39;t have enough time (90:21 - 90:30)
to do that so that was cool and I&#39;m (90:24 - 90:30)
sure the only thing drive like the main (90:30 - 90:35)
driving force to that town is the (90:34 - 90:39)
Pikachu train and what you do after (90:35 - 90:43)
it I don&#39;t know why else he would be (90:39 - 90:46)
there um but there&#39;s that one Pokey LD (90:43 - 90:49)
there the Geodude Lapras and then the (90:46 - 90:51)
one (90:49 - 90:55)
in near Sendai station was the Lapras (90:51 - 90:58)
and Gerra one I think which is what was (90:55 - 90:59)
part of go (90:58 - 91:01)
Fest and I think there was another (90:59 - 91:03)
Lapras one that was like a 20 minute (91:01 - 91:05)
walk from that like mall but again it (91:03 - 91:07)
was (91:05 - 91:10)
raining um but I think there&#39;s like 12 (91:07 - 91:15)
or 14 Lapras Pokey Lids but the (91:10 - 91:17)
other I mean I just talked about Lapras (91:15 - 91:19)
like from Sendai to that Pikachu thing (91:17 - 91:25)
was two and a half hours on train (91:19 - 91:25)
so they&#39;re (91:27 - 91:30)
cool but I I totally see why people (91:31 - 91:38)
like not don&#39;t care but it&#39;s like if (91:35 - 91:40)
you&#39;re going to Japan for the first time (91:38 - 91:44)
and you only have a week yeah yeah it&#39;s (91:40 - 91:46)
much easier to look up videos of people (91:44 - 91:48)
going and and finding the Poke lits than (91:46 - 91:51)
it is to go and find them yourself even (91:48 - 91:55)
if you are in Japan right right (91:51 - 92:00)
okay so like the Charizard Venusaur (91:55 - 92:02)
Blastoise (92:00 - 92:06)
Mew are all together oh on an (92:02 - 92:10)
island that takes 6 hours on a boat to (92:06 - 92:13)
get to and the boat only runs like twice (92:10 - 92:15)
a (92:13 - 92:17)
week really and so when you get there (92:15 - 92:21)
you have to then commit and stay there (92:17 - 92:23)
and then wait for the boat to come back (92:21 - 92:26)
to take you (92:23 - 92:26)
amazing that&#39;s (92:26 - 92:32)
intense and I think the Eevee Evolutions (92:28 - 92:34)
are also on an (92:32 - 92:37)
island I think that boat runs more frequ (92:34 - 92:39)
more (92:37 - 92:42)
frequently but they definitely (92:39 - 92:44)
put in my opinion I don&#39;t know if this (92:42 - 92:47)
is true they put the good Pokemon in (92:44 - 92:52)
harder spots mhm a good Pokemon the the (92:47 - 92:54)
Pokemon that people may find like like (92:52 - 92:57)
maybe more popular I think the popular (92:54 - 93:00)
ones the good ones there is a bronzer (92:57 - 93:03)
fan out there who is just seething and (93:00 - 93:06)
also the more widely recognizable ones (93:03 - 93:09)
yeah definitely defitely also Pokemon&#39;s (93:06 - 93:11)
not the only (93:09 - 93:13)
like mascot that does this there&#39;s like (93:11 - 93:16)
Pokey Lids of like Astro Boy and Hello (93:13 - 93:18)
Kitty and oh I said poids there are (93:16 - 93:22)
other manhole covers of other characters (93:18 - 93:23)
throughout Japan I hope they&#39;re called (93:22 - 93:26)
poids (93:23 - 93:29)
what was your question Boby uh no so I (93:26 - 93:31)
was just going to say (93:29 - 93:34)
overall the Pikachu train (93:31 - 93:38)
like worth it do you think if someone is (93:34 - 93:40)
going to Japan for a like maybe longer (93:38 - 93:44)
than a few days or a week and they&#39;re a (93:40 - 93:45)
Pokemon (93:44 - 93:50)
fan should they check it (93:45 - 93:52)
out I (93:50 - 93:55)
think yes I think at least one way I (93:52 - 93:58)
think like to that town is worth it I (93:55 - 94:01)
don&#39;t again I don&#39;t know if we got lucky (93:58 - 94:03)
and we got like a free ride back or (94:01 - 94:06)
Julie paid like (94:03 - 94:10)
double it wasn&#39;t a free ride back well (94:06 - 94:13)
yeah not a free ride back (94:10 - 94:13)
like I don&#39;t know what ticket she booked (94:13 - 94:19)
but I don&#39;t think you need the necessary (94:16 - 94:21)
like oh we&#39;re going to take the Pikachu (94:19 - 94:22)
train back cuz (94:21 - 94:25)
it&#39;s nothing different (94:22 - 94:26)
at (94:25 - 94:29)
all if I was to book it and it wasn&#39;t (94:26 - 94:32)
like rainy it would have been cool to (94:29 - 94:36)
spend a little bit more we had an hour (94:32 - 94:38)
45 minutes in that city which was just (94:36 - 94:42)
enough time to see Lapras eat and go (94:38 - 94:46)
back mhm it would have been cool to be (94:42 - 94:47)
there for like 3 or four hours to finish (94:46 - 94:49)
the stamp thing and then just like take (94:47 - 94:53)
a regular train back MH um but I (94:49 - 94:55)
probably would wouldn&#39;t only do that (94:53 - 94:56)
unless you (94:55 - 95:00)
were also going to like see (94:56 - 95:04)
Sendai um and I think Cai is awesome and (95:00 - 95:06)
that&#39;s like the one thing I (95:04 - 95:12)
will always credit Niantic for is (95:06 - 95:16)
like I&#39;ve been to so many cities that (95:12 - 95:19)
one I didn&#39;t even know was a city or if (95:16 - 95:22)
I did hear it I didn&#39;t know what it was (95:19 - 95:24)
about (95:22 - 95:29)
like goang in Kore South Korea like (95:24 - 95:30)
everyone knows (95:29 - 95:33)
soul never heard of goang before so (95:30 - 95:35)
going to goyang was like really cool and (95:33 - 95:38)
it was super different vibe than (95:35 - 95:42)
soul and I&#39;ve been to like Osaka Kyoto (95:38 - 95:46)
Tokyo hakone (95:42 - 95:48)
Yokohama heard of Sendai didn&#39;t know (95:46 - 95:50)
anything about (95:48 - 95:53)
Sendai and Sendai is awesome it&#39;s a cool (95:50 - 95:54)
City (95:53 - 95:58)
and it&#39;s like a real (95:54 - 95:58)
City yep (95:58 - 96:05)
yep I mean Pokemon go is expanding your (96:01 - 96:06)
understanding of the (96:05 - 96:09)
world which I think they would be happy (96:06 - 96:11)
about yeah that&#39;s what they set out to (96:09 - 96:15)
do so the mission (96:11 - 96:18)
accomplished they&#39;re good at doing that (96:15 - 96:20)
I wonder if people feel that way coming (96:18 - 96:21)
to the (96:20 - 96:25)
US like Chicago New (96:21 - 96:27)
York (96:25 - 96:32)
La I mean they are picking bigger cities (96:27 - 96:35)
but like Paris is a big city I&#39;ve never (96:32 - 96:39)
been to Paris M you know I never was (96:35 - 96:43)
never went to Berlin until a go Fest and (96:39 - 96:47)
I think Berlin&#39;s a really cool City (96:43 - 96:51)
MH so like I think that&#39;s why I also (96:47 - 96:54)
like the city experience not like sound (96:51 - 96:59)
like a like a a snob (96:54 - 96:59)
but like I spent a lot of time if you (96:59 - 97:04)
watch my twitch stream I spend a lot of (97:02 - 97:06)
time like walking into stores I&#39;m like (97:04 - 97:08)
oh what is this (97:06 - 97:11)
store and like I could have just been (97:08 - 97:14)
like face down non-stop I need 200 (97:11 - 97:19)
shinies but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I (97:14 - 97:22)
got four shiny Soul rocks never going to (97:19 - 97:26)
need four shiny Soul rocks (97:22 - 97:26)
ever like I just don&#39;t like it (97:26 - 97:34)
like if if that&#39;s what you want to do (97:32 - 97:39)
cool I get it MH but I like the city (97:34 - 97:42)
experience cuz I do get to play (97:39 - 97:45)
go but I can be like let&#39;s let&#39;s stop (97:42 - 97:47)
playing go for 10 minutes and let&#39;s (97:45 - 97:51)
check out the store let&#39;s pause for 20 (97:47 - 97:54)
minutes and like eat at this restaurant (97:51 - 97:56)
that we would never eat at because we&#39;re (97:54 - 97:59)
never here yeah it&#39;s a combination of (97:56 - 98:02)
the go Fest experience and the tourist (97:59 - 98:07)
experience of being somewhere new yeah (98:02 - 98:08)
again it&#39;s (98:07 - 98:12)
exactly what Niantic wants like this is (98:08 - 98:15)
like their like yes this is what we&#39;ve (98:12 - 98:18)
been building is this ability to play (98:15 - 98:21)
this game and discover a new place and (98:18 - 98:25)
go and experience that new place in more (98:21 - 98:27)
ways than just looking at your phone and (98:25 - 98:30)
walking around the sidewalk as you (98:27 - 98:32)
inevitably run into a person because (98:30 - 98:33)
you&#39;re looking at your phone right (98:32 - 98:37)
they&#39;re like you you can play the game (98:33 - 98:39)
and you can experience the city or the (98:37 - 98:42)
whatever place you&#39;re in (98:39 - 98:45)
and it it works and it&#39;s that and that&#39;s (98:42 - 98:49)
great too I mean even like go Fest aside (98:45 - 98:51)
I will say (98:49 - 98:54)
that I&#39;ve lived in San Diego my entire (98:51 - 98:56)
life so I&#39;ve lived in San Diego for 35 (98:54 - 98:59)
years and go like Pokémon go has (98:56 - 99:01)
actually made me like discover parts of (98:59 - 99:03)
San Diego that I didn&#39;t know existed (99:01 - 99:05)
just because it was like oh this is a (99:03 - 99:07)
popular spot oh there&#39;s a lot of Poké (99:05 - 99:09)
stops here I&#39;ll go check this place out (99:07 - 99:13)
and walk around here um and so to see (99:09 - 99:16)
that translate to a big event like a go (99:13 - 99:17)
Fest and you&#39;re getting to check out (99:16 - 99:19)
these different places or different (99:17 - 99:23)
cities um it&#39;s great and it and it is (99:19 - 99:26)
exactly what antic wanted so they&#39;re (99:23 - 99:28)
doing they&#39;re doing what the their (99:26 - 99:33)
mission was to (99:28 - 99:33)
do yeah and I think they&#39;ve learned how (99:33 - 99:38)
to do events better because even like (99:36 - 99:40)
when I think of goyang which was two (99:38 - 99:42)
years (99:40 - 99:45)
ago it was specifically just in that (99:42 - 99:49)
Park which at the time like made sense (99:45 - 99:52)
because it was a smaller event versus (99:49 - 99:54)
last year where was like here&#39;s our (99:52 - 99:58)
safari own City experience and they (99:54 - 100:02)
curated yeah like here are the tourist (99:58 - 100:05)
spots but also you&#39;re seeing them and (100:02 - 100:06)
you&#39;re playing (100:05 - 100:09)
go um which still is one of the cooler (100:06 - 100:11)
sounding experiences that&#39;s the kind of (100:09 - 100:13)
thing I want them to do more (100:11 - 100:17)
of the Safari zones yeah the the city (100:13 - 100:21)
safaris yeah with the routes (100:17 - 100:25)
yeah yeah those I like that stuff too (100:21 - 100:27)
also skadoo really popular trade people (100:25 - 100:30)
want I didn&#39;t realize it people want (100:27 - 100:32)
skadoo yeah they&#39;re only at Safari Zone (100:30 - 100:35)
events right yeah so yeah you can&#39;t (100:32 - 100:39)
there&#39;s no other way to get sco um do (100:35 - 100:41)
you think that let&#39;s take it back taking (100:39 - 100:43)
it back to the very first go Fest do you (100:41 - 100:45)
think that the city (100:43 - 100:48)
experience ended up coming out of the (100:45 - 100:51)
failure that was the first go Fest and (100:48 - 100:52)
leading them to say okay we&#39;re going to (100:51 - 100:55)
open up spawns around City for the next (100:52 - 100:58)
day because we screwed up the in park (100:55 - 101:00)
experience and then that led to people (100:58 - 101:03)
being like Oh I actually really loved (101:00 - 101:04)
the fact that we were able to walk (101:03 - 101:06)
around the city and have all these (101:04 - 101:09)
spawns work this way and then Niantic (101:06 - 101:12)
was like all right we&#39;re g maybe we (101:09 - 101:13)
should work on having like a city (101:12 - 101:15)
experience and a park experience to (101:13 - 101:17)
these events because clearly people (101:15 - 101:20)
ended up loving it even though we messed (101:17 - 101:23)
up and they can host so many more people (101:20 - 101:26)
when they&#39;re doing that yeah yeah yeah (101:23 - 101:29)
it just it obviously could have gone (101:26 - 101:31)
anyway but it feels like that accident (101:29 - 101:33)
that turned into we screwed up we&#39;re (101:31 - 101:36)
going to like do this and now you know (101:33 - 101:38)
seven years later we&#39;re like the city (101:36 - 101:40)
experience is better than the park (101:38 - 101:43)
experience it&#39;s like oh huh that you (101:40 - 101:46)
know the park experience would be better (101:43 - 101:52)
if they got more than three songs on (101:46 - 101:54)
repeat yeah well again the park (101:52 - 101:56)
experience allows that control and (101:54 - 101:59)
allows it to be like hey there here you (101:56 - 102:01)
all are you&#39;re here for this event and (101:59 - 102:03)
you&#39;re all here together in this park (102:01 - 102:05)
and they can put the things that they (102:03 - 102:08)
want out there and all of that but (102:05 - 102:11)
then you know it&#39;s like okay now you go (102:08 - 102:13)
into the City and you do play how you (102:11 - 102:15)
want to play and do what you want to do (102:13 - 102:16)
um but they still have that part where (102:15 - 102:19)
it&#39;s like we&#39;re all together as a as a (102:16 - 102:21)
group for everybody that wanted to be (102:19 - 102:23)
here to do this and so I think it&#39;s a (102:21 - 102:25)
nice split you know you kind of have to (102:23 - 102:26)
like you said earlier Hannah you have to (102:25 - 102:28)
have that Park experience you have to (102:26 - 102:31)
have that portion of it and then (102:28 - 102:33)
obviously the the city experience you (102:31 - 102:35)
know is great as well so I think it&#39;s a (102:33 - 102:37)
good a good (102:35 - 102:41)
split I do Wonder on (102:37 - 102:41)
the marketing slash business side of (102:41 - 102:50)
things is (102:45 - 102:50)
if like obviously the city makes (102:51 - 102:56)
money like people are coming in people (102:54 - 102:57)
are going to restaurants people are (102:56 - 103:01)
using public transportation or taxis or (102:57 - 103:03)
Ubers or whatever (103:01 - 103:07)
and the hotels are definitely making (103:03 - 103:09)
money but with (103:07 - 103:11)
the when I walked into the one store to (103:09 - 103:14)
be like I want whatever the prize is as (103:11 - 103:16)
long as I have something Pokemon here (103:14 - 103:19)
I&#39;m probably going to buy it and I (103:16 - 103:20)
walked in that it was like a puzzle (103:19 - 103:22)
store and they had a bunch of cool like (103:20 - 103:24)
just puzzles and stuff and they had (103:22 - 103:25)
like a couple Pokemon (103:24 - 103:29)
goas and I was like oh I could have (103:25 - 103:32)
gotten this thing at a thousand other (103:29 - 103:34)
stores but I&#39;m just going to get it here (103:32 - 103:36)
because I want to see what the thing is (103:34 - 103:39)
and you could tell it was like a ma andp (103:36 - 103:41)
shop and they were like really (103:39 - 103:42)
appreciative they were like really (103:41 - 103:44)
excited they had people in and it could (103:42 - 103:47)
have just been like Japanese Hospitality (103:44 - 103:50)
but like they seemed like genuinely like (103:47 - 103:52)
cool we got customers we&#39;ll take care of (103:50 - 103:54)
you thank you for shopping (103:52 - 103:55)
hope to see you (103:54 - 104:00)
again and even though like the sticker (103:55 - 104:02)
that nian gave them was like kind of (104:00 - 104:07)
lame it was still cool to see them (104:02 - 104:10)
partner with like businesses to be like (104:07 - 104:12)
hey we&#39;re bringing (104:10 - 104:14)
tourists if you want to work with us (104:12 - 104:16)
maybe this will bring you more foot (104:14 - 104:20)
traffic so anyways after my long rant I (104:16 - 104:24)
do I am curious of like does that work (104:20 - 104:30)
work are people going into these smaller (104:24 - 104:33)
local shops and (104:30 - 104:34)
supporting and I kind of think of that (104:33 - 104:38)
cuz like I think of Hawaii coming (104:34 - 104:39)
up (104:38 - 104:43)
and on the show we like debated of like (104:39 - 104:45)
is it worth going should you go does (104:43 - 104:48)
Hawaii need tourism does it not need (104:45 - 104:51)
like that whole debate but (104:48 - 104:54)
like if you go to Hawaii Hawaii and (104:51 - 104:57)
you&#39;re like ah (104:54 - 105:00)
Starbucks that&#39;s not benefiting (104:57 - 105:02)
Hawaii right that&#39;s just benefiting (105:00 - 105:04)
Starbucks whereas like if you go to (105:02 - 105:06)
Hawaii and you go to like a locally (105:04 - 105:11)
owned coffee shop M that is supporting (105:06 - 105:14)
that business and that (105:11 - 105:18)
economy so I I do wonder (105:14 - 105:21)
if Niantic actually partnering with (105:18 - 105:25)
these stores along Ong the strip helped (105:21 - 105:28)
and if it did that&#39;s awesome that&#39;s like (105:25 - 105:31)
really cool (105:28 - 105:34)
but they&#39;re never going to (105:31 - 105:39)
say of course I&#39;m I mean they could I&#39;m (105:34 - 105:42)
I&#39;m sure it helped in the way (105:39 - 105:44)
that they wouldn&#39;t have had you as a (105:42 - 105:47)
customer if the right I mean that most (105:44 - 105:49)
likely maybe they would have but like I (105:47 - 105:51)
mean there are like they&#39;re they&#39;re (105:49 - 105:54)
going to get a group of people who (105:51 - 105:57)
otherwise would not have popped in that (105:54 - 106:00)
store if there wasn&#39;t something else (105:57 - 106:02)
bringing them there they also could have (106:00 - 106:04)
had many customers who do love going (106:02 - 106:05)
into that store I&#39;m not saying that they (106:04 - 106:07)
didn&#39;t have anything to offer but there (106:05 - 106:11)
is also a group of people (106:07 - 106:13)
who you specifically you wouldn&#39;t have (106:11 - 106:14)
gone into a puzzle store to buy (106:13 - 106:17)
something most likely if there wasn&#39;t (106:14 - 106:19)
something that led you to that place so (106:17 - 106:21)
I mean (106:19 - 106:24)
there&#39;s it worked on me (106:21 - 106:26)
yeah and I&#39;m sure it worked on others as (106:24 - 106:28)
well so like I I mean there&#39;s definitely (106:26 - 106:31)
some help in that you know like I guess (106:28 - 106:33)
the question is is it is it something (106:31 - 106:36)
that is (106:33 - 106:40)
um does it make a big difference or is (106:36 - 106:43)
it just a a very small bump for a short (106:40 - 106:46)
period of time um you know I guess that (106:43 - 106:47)
would be (106:46 - 106:50)
the the question there I suppose my (106:47 - 106:51)
question is whether n entic is doing (106:50 - 106:54)
this with organization they have ties to (106:51 - 106:58)
in some way in order to get the (106:54 - 107:00)
analytics that they can use to promote (106:58 - 107:02)
it to bigger businesses and say we (107:00 - 107:06)
brought this much foot traffic in and (107:02 - 107:08)
and do that kind of thing but I don&#39;t (107:06 - 107:11)
know it&#39;s all complicated especially the (107:08 - 107:13)
whole situation in Hawaii is a little (107:11 - 107:15)
more complicated and different but even (107:13 - 107:17)
this tourism is (107:15 - 107:21)
complicated mhm (107:17 - 107:21)
mhm but yeah the stores they partnered (107:21 - 107:28)
with weren&#39;t like (107:25 - 107:32)
McDonald&#39;s good perfect great yeah no (107:28 - 107:33)
every time I saw the (107:32 - 107:38)
sign it was like a manpa shop mhm nice (107:33 - 107:43)
it wasn&#39;t like H&amp;M or yeah (107:38 - 107:46)
right right no wasn&#39;t uni low yeah yeah (107:43 - 107:49)
it wasn&#39;t uni CL (107:46 - 107:51)
or but I think that made it a little bit (107:49 - 107:55)
harder to spot mhm mhm cuz like the (107:51 - 107:57)
place I ended up going to was like (107:55 - 108:00)
upstairs so you had to (107:57 - 108:03)
like oh the sign is explore yeah oh it&#39;s (108:00 - 108:04)
like pointing (108:03 - 108:11)
upstairs did they have a um Poké stop in (108:04 - 108:13)
these places like in the (108:11 - 108:17)
game not the store I visited okay I just (108:13 - 108:20)
you know it&#39;s like they could just they (108:17 - 108:23)
could do things in game to get people to (108:20 - 108:26)
easily go there since the game is a map (108:23 - 108:28)
yeah yeah it could have made it easier (108:26 - 108:32)
to find the places yeah I also (108:28 - 108:36)
wonder how good of a (108:32 - 108:39)
surprise nian could have done right like (108:36 - 108:41)
if I walked into a (108:39 - 108:45)
store and it was like free gift with any (108:41 - 108:48)
purchase that&#39;s literally what it said (108:45 - 108:51)
just any purchase free gift show your (108:48 - 108:53)
phone that you&#39;re playing Pokemon go (108:51 - 108:58)
and so I spent 10 bucks and then I (108:53 - 109:00)
figured out was a (108:58 - 109:00)
sticker but if it was something cooler (109:01 - 109:07)
again I don&#39;t know what cool is maybe (109:04 - 109:10)
two incubators and two lucky eggs right (109:07 - 109:13)
just bare cost them nothing yeah it cost (109:10 - 109:16)
them nothing would that then drive more (109:13 - 109:18)
traffic like I come out of the store (109:16 - 109:22)
being like oh cool I got a unique code (109:18 - 109:24)
for these digital items oh and then they (109:22 - 109:27)
hear about it and they go oh next time I (109:24 - 109:30)
see something I&#39;m more inclined to (109:27 - 109:33)
buy they would have to strike a a (109:30 - 109:35)
careful balance there because I could (109:33 - 109:37)
imagine everybody going into every (109:35 - 109:39)
single one of the stores they could if (109:37 - 109:41)
it well maybe not and just buying the (109:39 - 109:45)
cheapest thing possible would be (109:41 - 109:48)
the yeah I was going to say if they&#39;re (109:45 - 109:51)
if it&#39;s these smaller shops that are (109:48 - 109:53)
being you know (109:51 - 109:55)
going to an extreme here but like if you (109:53 - 109:58)
were like you know van go Pikachu plush (109:55 - 110:00)
is the gift or whatever and then you (109:58 - 110:03)
have all of a sudden 50 people at the (110:00 - 110:04)
same time rushing into a store you know (110:03 - 110:07)
you want to strike that that balance of (110:04 - 110:08)
what is going to get people in the (110:07 - 110:11)
stores but also not make it like (110:08 - 110:13)
uncontrollable for those for those shops (110:11 - 110:15)
as well and I mean to your point though (110:13 - 110:17)
I mean like if you were getting a free (110:15 - 110:19)
item I mean I&#39;m guessing that the QR (110:17 - 110:20)
code that was on the back you thought (110:19 - 110:22)
was maybe going to potentially be (110:20 - 110:23)
something like that (110:22 - 110:25)
yeah I thought it was be (110:23 - 110:28)
like egg Pokemon (110:25 - 110:31)
go yeah no that definitely (110:28 - 110:33)
uh definitely cool that they did this in (110:31 - 110:35)
the first play they did it the way they (110:33 - 110:36)
did and that is that&#39;s cool with the (110:35 - 110:39)
little surprise and getting you to go to (110:36 - 110:41)
um some different (110:39 - 110:43)
places um definitely some improvements (110:41 - 110:45)
that could be made there but it sounds (110:43 - 110:46)
like it was a (110:45 - 110:49)
good uh a good (110:46 - 110:53)
idea yeah makes me curious of where they (110:49 - 110:56)
would pick in jaban next (110:53 - 110:56)
year because they&#39;re probably not going (110:59 - 111:03)
to do (111:00 - 111:03)
Tokyo we got plenty of (111:06 - 111:10)
options yeah I don&#39;t know ngoya I don&#39;t (111:11 - 111:16)
think they&#39;ve ever done (111:15 - 111:20)
ngoya I don&#39;t think (111:16 - 111:20)
so that&#39;s like (111:21 - 111:27)
in between Tokyo and (111:24 - 111:30)
Kyoto have they done (111:27 - 111:30)
hakone they&#39;ve done (111:31 - 111:36)
Yokohama (111:34 - 111:40)
Osaka I think they did Osaka twice mhm (111:36 - 111:43)
different Parks (111:40 - 111:43)
though this is the farthest north (111:44 - 111:48)
they&#39;ve done yeah I was about to say (111:46 - 111:50)
it&#39;s really nice that they&#39;re doing it (111:48 - 111:52)
in Sendai because it&#39;s really kind of (111:50 - 111:55)
out there it&#39;s much farther away and not (111:52 - 111:57)
in between any of the big cities that (111:55 - 111:59)
people usually want to go (111:57 - 112:02)
to (111:59 - 112:02)
yeah (112:03 - 112:09)
Saturday and today did feel busier cuz (112:05 - 112:10)
it was a (112:09 - 112:15)
weekend but it was still easy (112:10 - 112:18)
to (112:15 - 112:21)
like I guess it&#39;s a travel tip people (112:18 - 112:25)
are like make it seem like booking a (112:21 - 112:28)
bullet train is like really stressful (112:25 - 112:29)
and you should do it like a week ahead (112:28 - 112:31)
of time and like you got to go to a (112:29 - 112:34)
counter and talk to a person you just go (112:31 - 112:37)
to the machine and hit English and then (112:34 - 112:40)
just hit which stations you (112:37 - 112:44)
want at 7:30 I went to the (112:40 - 112:47)
machine and they had tickets out of (112:44 - 112:53)
Sendai to Tokyo in 30 minutes like they (112:47 - 112:54)
continued running trains like it wasn&#39;t (112:53 - 112:57)
like ah we should have booked our ticket (112:54 - 113:01)
out of here a week ago (112:57 - 113:03)
like like yeah it was (113:01 - 113:06)
like the reserve seats were filled up (113:03 - 113:09)
but there was still a way to get out (113:06 - 113:09)
like it felt good I think that&#39;s very (113:10 - 113:17)
important to an event of like how easy (113:15 - 113:20)
it is to get to or to get out of like I (113:17 - 113:23)
remember people complained about the (113:20 - 113:27)
Network going down in Las Vegas which is (113:23 - 113:30)
like that wasn&#39;t a big deal to me (113:27 - 113:32)
because like I knew they fix it mhm what (113:30 - 113:34)
was annoying was (113:32 - 113:38)
like the very tiny parking lot in Vegas (113:34 - 113:40)
and the only way to get out was like (113:38 - 113:43)
uber there was no trains there was no (113:40 - 113:45)
buses (113:43 - 113:49)
right and it was just like they that (113:45 - 113:53)
again get an Uber in Vegas (113:49 - 113:56)
it&#39;s just a nightmare yep well that&#39;s (113:53 - 113:59)
why uh I mean I guess they did an LA one (113:56 - 114:02)
but I feel like if they did a i if they (113:59 - 114:06)
did like a San Diego event it would be (114:02 - 114:08)
awful because transport the public (114:06 - 114:11)
transportation system here is awful so (114:08 - 114:15)
unless you do it in a very specific way (114:11 - 114:18)
it would be Uber&#39;s or something to get (114:15 - 114:21)
to wherever you kind of needed to go (114:18 - 114:24)
unfortunately (114:21 - 114:24)
yeah I guess we&#39;ll Circle back for (114:26 - 114:32)
Madrid a lot of places are better with (114:29 - 114:33)
the public transportation than the (114:32 - 114:38)
places in America are so (114:33 - 114:41)
yeah well New York is pretty good New (114:38 - 114:43)
York is New York that&#39;s why they&#39;re (114:41 - 114:46)
still in New York I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a (114:43 - 114:48)
factor Chicago is also pretty good and (114:46 - 114:51)
they did Chicago for three (114:48 - 114:54)
years yeah (114:51 - 114:54)
yeah okay it&#39;s 2:00 a.m. here I need to (114:55 - 114:59)
go to (114:58 - 115:01)
bed it&#39;s almost (114:59 - 115:04)
2:30 all (115:01 - 115:09)
right all right well uh if you made it (115:04 - 115:11)

train did I convince you of the Pikachu (115:18 - 115:23)
