the end of the show that&#39;s in the show (2:05 - 2:09)
notes uh but before we get there of (2:06 - 2:13)
course welcome to the number one most (2:09 - 2:16)
premium Pokemon sleep podcast on the (2:13 - 2:18)
internet where we talk about Pokemon (2:16 - 2:21)
sleep every week (2:18 - 2:25)
uh as we should because no one else (2:21 - 2:29)
is uh I went to the old Power Plant I (2:25 - 2:33)
think of the only here on the the show (2:29 - 2:36)
who has old Power Plant unlocked uh as (2:33 - 2:39)
of this morning I was Ultra rank one my (2:36 - 2:44)
spawns were Pikachu Pikachu Eevee (2:39 - 2:47)
quackley and Magnemite yeah it feels (2:44 - 2:52)
real good being at the old Power Plant (2:47 - 2:57)
mhm I&#39;ve seen one Aron no shins no (2:52 - 3:01)
grubbing it&#39;s it&#39;s a real it&#39;s how&#39;s the (2:57 - 3:05)
music oh yeah music music is good okay (3:01 - 3:06)
good music that&#39;s the important thing (3:05 - 3:08)
that is the most important thing that&#39;s (3:06 - 3:09)
the most important thing about Pokemon (3:08 - 3:11)
sleep is the (3:09 - 3:16)
music uh okay so it&#39;s almost like you (3:11 - 3:19)
predicted this last week when you said (3:16 - 3:21)
that we shouldn&#39;t go to the new place (3:19 - 3:22)
especially (3:21 - 3:25)
midweek because especially because all (3:22 - 3:27)
the new spawns are going to end up on (3:25 - 3:30)
green grass tomorrow or today as this (3:27 - 3:34)
comes out yes yes uh yeah the we talked (3:30 - 3:35)
about that event last week where you&#39;ll (3:34 - 3:37)
have the option if you have old Power (3:35 - 3:39)
Plant unlocked you can go to Old power (3:37 - 3:42)
plant or you can go to green (3:39 - 3:44)
grass I don&#39;t know why like if you&#39;re if (3:42 - 3:47)
you&#39;re a hardcore player and you have (3:44 - 3:49)
old Power Plant and you have Pokemon to (3:47 - 3:51)
go there I still think it&#39;s beneficial (3:49 - 3:54)
to go to Green Grass and then just use (3:51 - 3:57)
an easy travel ticket and then just move (3:54 - 3:59)
to power plant assuming you don&#39;t have (3:57 - 4:01)
everything Max out cuz if you do have (3:59 - 4:03)
everything maxed out then that 5% would (4:01 - 4:05)
go to old Power Plant (4:03 - 4:08)
anyways oh right like I have everything (4:05 - 4:11)
maxed out except snow (4:08 - 4:13)
[Music] (4:11 - 4:16)
drop but it&#39;ll go to snow drop if you (4:13 - 4:18)
don&#39;t yeah yeah it&#39;s g go to snow drop (4:16 - 4:20)
if I don&#39;t for (4:18 - 4:24)
sure uh there there is uh besides old (4:20 - 4:26)
power plant being added there there is (4:24 - 4:30)
some news here off Pokemon sleep.now (4:26 - 4:34)
response to inappropriate (4:30 - 4:38)
conduct I just like the title of this (4:34 - 4:38)
article they said thank you for playing (4:39 - 4:43)
Pokemon sleep this is an announcement uh (4:41 - 4:45)
about our response to inappropriate (4:43 - 4:47)
conduct with the within the app we will (4:45 - 4:49)
be strengthening our response to (4:47 - 4:51)
inappropriate conduct so players can (4:49 - 4:55)
play the game with full Peace of Mind un (4:51 - 4:58)
using unauthorized tools or programs to (4:55 - 5:01)
conduct a considerable number of sleep (4:58 - 5:04)
research sessions inappropriate conduct (5:01 - 5:06)
such as above is a conflict with our (5:04 - 5:07)
terms of use and we will take be taking (5:06 - 5:10)
measures such as suspending the user&#39;s (5:07 - 5:14)
account uh if it is detected in either (5:10 - 5:17)
past or future gameplay obtaining a (5:14 - 5:19)
sleep score of (5:17 - 5:23)
101 or more in a day via inappropriate (5:19 - 5:25)
operations for players who obtained a (5:23 - 5:28)
lot of rewards via inappropriate conduct (5:25 - 5:30)
players restrictions may be implemented (5:28 - 5:33)
for several days while we collect (5:30 - 5:36)
fraudulent obtained rewards we plan to (5:33 - 5:37)
make fixes in the (5:36 - 5:40)
future I do like the (5:37 - 5:42)
concept of (5:40 - 5:47)
people hardcore cheating in this game if (5:42 - 5:50)
it&#39;s like yeah because why right it&#39;s (5:47 - 5:54)
not even there&#39;s no competition here (5:50 - 5:56)
it&#39;s just for your own (5:54 - 6:00)
benefit there&#39;s no competitive sleep yet (5:56 - 6:01)
there might be one (6:00 - 6:05)
day there is in that one video that one (6:01 - 6:07)
very very good video oh the April fools (6:05 - 6:11)
April Fool one right yeah (6:07 - 6:15)
yeah uh yeah I don&#39;t P I don&#39;t know when (6:11 - 6:18)
I saw that I all I could think was I (6:15 - 6:20)
don&#39;t even know how people are doing (6:18 - 6:23)
this like yeah I can I don&#39;t I never hit (6:20 - 6:26)
like 80% or sleep score 80 or higher let (6:23 - 6:29)
alone I was like I have no idea what (6:26 - 6:31)
like they could be doing to get 101 and (6:29 - 6:34)
I know there&#39;s like I&#39;m sure a million (6:31 - 6:35)
people could tell me and that&#39;s fine I (6:34 - 6:37)
don&#39;t got a pre game you got a pre (6:35 - 6:42)
game he&#39;s like extra pregaming pregaming (6:37 - 6:44)
though like obviously they wouldn&#39;t tell (6:42 - 6:46)
you how they&#39;re doing it because then (6:44 - 6:48)
that would lead to more like I don&#39;t (6:46 - 6:50)
know what they&#39;re doing to do that there (6:48 - 6:53)
was like a very early on before Bobby (6:50 - 6:54)
was playing Pokemon sleep there was (6:53 - 6:57)
something where Hannah and I talked (6:54 - 6:59)
about it where people were figuring out (6:57 - 7:01)
how to like Max their (6:59 - 7:03)
Pikachu like right away and that that (7:01 - 7:05)
was like the first like cheating was (7:03 - 7:08)
like they got their sleep cat Pikachu to (7:05 - 7:11)
like level 80 or something even though (7:08 - 7:14)
it couldn&#39;t go to level 80 and then what (7:11 - 7:17)
and then what like then you get more (7:14 - 7:21)
berries great so so they&#39;re at so (7:17 - 7:23)
because of this they&#39;re now at the power (7:21 - 7:26)
plant this week catching pikach more (7:23 - 7:30)
Pikachu yeah that&#39;s true (7:26 - 7:32)
uh yeah I mean (7:30 - 7:35)
it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s funny the thing about (7:32 - 7:37)
this that is interesting to me is that (7:35 - 7:41)
they do say past or future so it&#39;s (7:37 - 7:42)
almost it&#39;s like they&#39;re not even just (7:41 - 7:44)
saying like here&#39;s a warning for the (7:42 - 7:47)
future they&#39;re saying if you cheated in (7:44 - 7:49)
the past we&#39;re looking into that as well (7:47 - 7:53)
and that&#39;s you don&#39;t see that as often (7:49 - 7:56)
when the response comes out like when (7:53 - 7:58)
the actual you know we&#39;ve seen this in (7:56 - 8:00)
Pokémon go a little bit where they&#39;ve (7:58 - 8:02)
been they&#39;ve said like hey we know this (8:00 - 8:04)
is happening we&#39;re going to crack down (8:02 - 8:06)
on this stop doing it this is like we (8:04 - 8:07)
know this is happening we&#39;re going to (8:06 - 8:09)
crack down on it and if you&#39;ve already (8:07 - 8:12)
been doing it be worried yeah which is a (8:09 - 8:14)
little the bullet where they&#39;re saying (8:12 - 8:16)
that uh the point where they&#39;re saying (8:14 - 8:18)
that players who have obtained a lot of (8:16 - 8:22)
rewards by doing these cheating things (8:18 - 8:23)
they&#39;re going to not only restrict your (8:22 - 8:25)
accounts but also go into your account (8:23 - 8:28)
and take back those items that they can (8:25 - 8:32)
take back is kind of what wild yeah it&#39;s (8:28 - 8:35)
it&#39;s uh it&#39;s I mean rightly so because (8:32 - 8:36)
it is their game they don&#39;t want people (8:35 - 8:39)
to cheat but yeah it&#39;s like (8:36 - 8:43)
threatening almost like you know it&#39;s (8:39 - 8:45)
it&#39;s kind of scary to hear that it&#39;s (8:43 - 8:48)
just clear communication it is exactly (8:45 - 8:50)
what we have learned to expect from this (8:48 - 8:52)
team and I appreciate it I don&#39;t know (8:50 - 8:55)
they&#39;re like so dream shards huh those (8:52 - 8:57)
are some nice dream shards to be a a (8:55 - 9:01)
bummer if something happened to them (8:57 - 9:04)
I don&#39;t know I mean this this is like a (9:01 - 9:05)
thing (9:04 - 9:09)
in um like gotta games like genin impact (9:05 - 9:11)
or or whatever other gotcha game you&#39;re (9:09 - 9:14)
playing where people would spend h100 (9:11 - 9:18)
$200 on the currency and then tell Apple (9:14 - 9:20)
that like their (9:18 - 9:23)
kid accidentally like bought it and then (9:20 - 9:25)
the developer would be like okay that&#39;s (9:23 - 9:28)
fine but now you are negative 30,000 (9:25 - 9:30)
gems in this (9:28 - 9:34)
Game Y and unless you go and spend the (9:30 - 9:36)
money you&#39;re not going to get out of (9:34 - 9:37)
that deficit (9:36 - 9:40)
like you&#39;re just NE you&#39;re just negative (9:37 - 9:45)
100 going forward yeah yeah well it&#39;s (9:40 - 9:47)
still just it baffles me because it&#39;s (9:45 - 9:50)
like you&#39;re not getting anything out of (9:47 - 9:53)
this like you&#39;re not getting it&#39;s not (9:50 - 9:55)
not getting numbers to go up they&#39;re (9:53 - 9:57)
getting numbers to go up faster without (9:55 - 10:00)
putting in the work that (9:57 - 10:02)
you have to put in to get the numbers to (10:00 - 10:05)
go up faster in this game yes you like (10:02 - 10:07)
seeing the numbers go up this is why (10:05 - 10:09)
you&#39;ve gotten so hardcore in this game (10:07 - 10:11)
Bobby you are more hardcore in sleep (10:09 - 10:14)
than I am I am (10:11 - 10:17)
however like but yeah I&#39;m not going to (10:14 - 10:19)
I&#39;m not going to cheat to get ahead like (10:17 - 10:24)
I you know uh in fact I will say so um (10:19 - 10:27)
since the Apple health and the like (10:24 - 10:30)
Smartwatch stuff has come out I&#39;ve been (10:27 - 10:32)
pretty much using like my go Plus+ is (10:30 - 10:34)
sitting on my desk I don&#39;t I haven&#39;t (10:32 - 10:36)
charged it in like two weeks so it&#39;s (10:34 - 10:38)
probably not even it&#39;s probably dead (10:36 - 10:40)
right now but I&#39;ve been using my Apple (10:38 - 10:44)
watch and honestly I feel like (10:40 - 10:47)
it&#39;s I don&#39;t know if it just doesn&#39;t (10:44 - 10:49)
track my sleep well I like this morning (10:47 - 10:52)
I woke up and it said I woke up like two (10:49 - 10:55)
hours prior and so I only you know so (10:52 - 10:57)
then that obviously translates to sleep (10:55 - 11:00)
and then my sleep score was like 30 (10:57 - 11:01)
points less than I thought it should (11:00 - 11:03)
have been based on literally how I woke (11:01 - 11:07)
up I woke up and was like What if Che (11:03 - 11:10)
for those extra 30 (11:07 - 11:10)
points honest I will say honestly I (11:10 - 11:14)
think that same thing happened to me (11:13 - 11:16)
this morning with the watch tracking (11:14 - 11:19)
Bobby because I woke up briefly just to (11:16 - 11:21)
get up and go to the bathroom around the (11:19 - 11:22)
time I would normally wake up on a (11:21 - 11:25)
weekday MH and so it thought I was awake (11:22 - 11:27)
awake but then I went back to sleep for (11:25 - 11:29)
a couple of hours and that didn&#39;t get (11:27 - 11:31)
counted see that&#39;s happened throughout (11:29 - 11:32)
the week I&#39;ve done that same thing and (11:31 - 11:35)
it does count it this morning I don&#39;t (11:32 - 11:36)
know what it was like maybe I was just (11:35 - 11:38)
moving around or something but it (11:36 - 11:41)
definitely um did not count it one one (11:38 - 11:44)
night this week I will say this has (11:41 - 11:46)
never happened I&#39;ve worned my watch many (11:44 - 11:49)
times to bed uh I woke up middle of the (11:46 - 11:51)
night and my watch was not on my wrist (11:49 - 11:54)
anymore somehow I took my watch off in (11:51 - 11:57)
the middle of the night and I didn&#39;t (11:54 - 11:58)
track it didn&#39;t track any sleep that (11:57 - 12:00)
night unfortunately Pokemon sleep so I (11:58 - 12:03)
missed a day which watch band do you (12:00 - 12:05)
have the just like the regular like the (12:03 - 12:07)
sport like it&#39;s got the little dot it&#39;s (12:05 - 12:10)
got tucked underneath I have no idea how (12:07 - 12:13)
I I think I&#39;ve had that happen once in (12:10 - 12:17)
in years of tracking shocked I was like (12:13 - 12:20)
how did I take my watch off strange (12:17 - 12:23)
experience yeah so uh Hannah you have a (12:20 - 12:26)
you have the aura ring don&#39;t you I do (12:23 - 12:28)
yeah does that work with Pokemon sleep (12:26 - 12:30)
it does not it doesn&#39;t work very well (12:28 - 12:33)
with apple Health cuz I would assume (12:30 - 12:35)
that it would send the data to Apple (12:33 - 12:36)
health and Pokemon sleep is looking at (12:35 - 12:39)
Apple Health you would assume so it (12:36 - 12:41)
doesn&#39;t send the data to Apple Health it (12:39 - 12:43)
reads data from Apple Health Sometimes (12:41 - 12:46)
some data what if it sends it to Google (12:43 - 12:49)
health and then Google that might work I (12:46 - 12:50)
don&#39;t know for sure because I haven&#39;t (12:49 - 12:52)
had an Android but I I have a feeling (12:50 - 12:53)
that might (12:52 - 12:55)
work that&#39;s yeah I didn&#39;t think about (12:53 - 12:58)
that because it I mean it does say there (12:55 - 13:01)
are specific deves that it works with (12:58 - 13:02)
but if it&#39;s just getting that (13:01 - 13:06)
information from the health app of the (13:02 - 13:08)
OS then it that shouldn&#39;t really because (13:06 - 13:10)
I know for the on the Apple side it&#39;s (13:08 - 13:14)
the series 3 watch and above but I don&#39;t (13:10 - 13:16)
know if that means because those are the (13:14 - 13:18)
only ones that tracks those must be the (13:16 - 13:20)
only ones that track sleep through Apple (13:18 - 13:23)
Health yeah since it&#39;s pulling it from (13:20 - 13:27)
Health anyways what I haven&#39;t tried is (13:23 - 13:30)
adding data to Apple health CU this (13:27 - 13:31)
morning I almost did that I wanted to be (13:30 - 13:33)
like I want those two extra hours (13:31 - 13:35)
because I slept two extra hours than it (13:33 - 13:37)
told me I did and I wanted to add the (13:35 - 13:39)
data to Apple Health but I wasn&#39;t sure (13:37 - 13:42)
if that would then like say oh you don&#39;t (13:39 - 13:46)
get to use this for Pokemon sleep (13:42 - 13:48)
because it&#39;s like you manually added (13:46 - 13:52)
something to the health app so if you (13:48 - 13:54)
know if anybody&#39;s done that let me know (13:52 - 13:56)
cuz I I would like to I&#39;m sure it&#39;s on (13:54 - 13:57)
Reddit or something but if you know if (13:56 - 14:00)
you&#39;ve done it like I&#39;d like to know uh (13:57 - 14:03)
if that does anything because one I feel (14:00 - 14:05)
like that would be I I can&#39;t imagine it (14:03 - 14:06)
would work because then that&#39;s just you (14:05 - 14:08)
could just Cheat It by like just adding (14:06 - 14:10)
in the data to Apple Health every (14:08 - 14:14)
morning but I I don&#39;t know seems (14:10 - 14:16)
weird we&#39;ll find out in a month where (14:14 - 14:20)
there&#39;s another news article being like (14:16 - 14:22)
we&#39;re cracking down on Apple Health (14:20 - 14:25)
cheaters how dare you get to 120 sleep (14:22 - 14:27)
score please nobody make them regret (14:25 - 14:30)
connecting the watches (14:27 - 14:32)
Pokemon sleep I want this to keep (14:30 - 14:36)
working it&#39;s it is the even though I (14:32 - 14:37)
think it&#39;s the best because I don&#39;t I (14:36 - 14:39)
just don&#39;t have to think about oh got to (14:37 - 14:41)
go grab my go Plus+ got to remember to (14:39 - 14:43)

York which I don&#39;t know what that is (15:38 - 15:43)
also is Comic Con happening the same (15:41 - 15:45)
time it must be because it says it&#39;s not (15:43 - 15:48)
affiliated with ComiCon oh I see no (15:45 - 15:51)
badge required to enter uh it is from (15:48 - 15:54)
9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on October 19th (15:51 - 15:57)
and through the 20th so just two days (15:54 - 15:59)
what is the Lavin it looks like it&#39;s an (15:57 - 16:01)
event (15:59 - 16:04)
space Oh I think this is where they (16:01 - 16:07)
held the no I lied I was going to say I (16:04 - 16:09)
think this is where they held the the (16:07 - 16:10)
remember when I they brought me out for (16:09 - 16:14)
like the anime thing early Horizons yep (16:10 - 16:16)
um it is not the same space is that but (16:14 - 16:19)
that was an event space somewhere in New (16:16 - 16:22)
York I&#39;m sure there are lots of event (16:19 - 16:24)
spaces in New York yeah it&#39;s a pretty (16:22 - 16:27)
small City I don&#39;t (16:24 - 16:27)
know this looks like a really cool event (16:28 - 16:36)
though mhm as someone who back in (16:30 - 16:36)
2015 uh went and just sort of walked (16:36 - 16:41)
around New York Comic conon and realized (16:39 - 16:43)
there&#39;s not a whole lot you can do (16:41 - 16:45)
outside the con if you don&#39;t have (16:43 - 16:48)
tickets um this seems like a cool fun (16:45 - 16:49)
thing you can go to if you don&#39;t have (16:48 - 16:53)
tickets yeah that&#39;s I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t (16:49 - 16:54)
realize it was like that in New York (16:53 - 16:57)
ComiCon cuz San Diego Comic-Con there&#39;s (16:54 - 16:58)
a lot of things you can do if you don&#39;t (16:57 - 16:59)
have tickets (16:58 - 17:02)
are just surrounding theen I&#39;ve gone to (16:59 - 17:04)
a lot of conventions where there&#39;s just (17:02 - 17:06)
a lot of outdoor Gatherings and people (17:04 - 17:08)
hanging out and that was not the case (17:06 - 17:10)
with New York ComiCon interesting at (17:08 - 17:12)
least in (17:10 - 17:15)
2015 yeah I what what&#39;s kind of weird (17:12 - 17:17)
about this to me and I get that it&#39;s (17:15 - 17:19)
just that it&#39;s they&#39;re trying to get (17:17 - 17:22)
people hyped up for surging Sparks but (17:19 - 17:24)
like surging Sparks isn&#39;t coming out for (17:22 - 17:26)
like another three weeks after this (17:24 - 17:29)
event November 8th I think is yeah so (17:26 - 17:31)
when they say like come pick up TCG swag (17:29 - 17:33)
you can&#39;t pick up any surging Sparks TCG (17:31 - 17:37)
stuff because it&#39;s not out yet um (17:33 - 17:41)
but I I do wonder I&#39;m assuming like the (17:37 - 17:42)
giant Pokemon cards you can take (17:41 - 17:44)
pictures with will probably be from (17:42 - 17:46)
surging Sparks since they have released (17:44 - 17:49)
a few of them um and you know uh debuted (17:46 - 17:52)
a few of the cards but I think that&#39;s (17:49 - 17:54)
pretty cool I think it&#39;ll be a nice (17:52 - 17:55)
little especially because there&#39;s no (17:54 - 17:57)
ticket needed or anything and you know (17:55 - 17:59)
if you&#39;re already at New York con (17:57 - 18:01)
ComiCon anyway uh you know you can pop (17:59 - 18:05)
out and go check that out I assume it&#39;ll (18:01 - 18:10)
get somewhat crowded I have a quote here (18:05 - 18:12)
quote we are always looking for new ways (18:10 - 18:14)
to surprise and Delight the Pokemon (18:12 - 18:15)
Community including Innovative and (18:14 - 18:17)
interactive experiences that allow (18:15 - 18:20)
trainers to engage with Pokemon TCG in (18:17 - 18:22)
addition to collecting and playing with (18:20 - 18:25)
cards says Barry Sams vice president of (18:22 - 18:28)
Pokemon TCG at the Pokemon company (18:25 - 18:30)
International experimental moments like (18:28 - 18:32)
this create magical Pokemon memories and (18:30 - 18:34)
we can&#39;t wait for our fans to explore (18:32 - 18:37)
all that awaits in the Stellar (18:34 - 18:39)
Maze (18:37 - 18:43)
and yeah they&#39;re not wrong (18:39 - 18:43)
yeah it&#39;s cool to go to events like this (18:43 - 18:50)
yeah yeah (18:47 - 18:50)
I I wonder how like big it will be and (18:51 - 18:58)
what I mean by that is like if you&#39;re (18:56 - 19:02)
waiting in line for 2 hours for like an (18:58 - 19:05)
8 minute experience is that like really (19:02 - 19:07)
worth it like is when when when they say (19:05 - 19:10)
maze is it like an actual maze or is it (19:07 - 19:11)
just like a hallway you walk down with (19:10 - 19:16)
some cards yeah that&#39;s fair (19:11 - 19:19)
yeah um and if there is did they not say (19:16 - 19:22)
there was stuff to buy they did yeah so (19:19 - 19:24)
it&#39;s like again are you waiting two (19:22 - 19:27)
hours getting in being like oh cool the (19:24 - 19:30)
only thing they have is a gift (19:27 - 19:33)
shop like it&#39;s just two hours for a gift (19:30 - 19:36)
shop for old cards right that you could (19:33 - 19:38)
easily get at Target yeah I hope it&#39;s (19:36 - 19:40)
more than (19:38 - 19:42)
that uh I didn&#39;t have this in the show (19:40 - 19:44)
notes but real quick uh the Pokemon (19:42 - 19:47)
company did uh this is also TCG related (19:44 - 19:49)
so uh they did a collaboration with Geek (19:47 - 19:51)
and (19:49 - 19:51)
Sundry (19:52 - 19:59)
which I remember (19:55 - 20:01)
I am one I am old enough to remember (19:59 - 20:04)
when geek and sunry (20:01 - 20:08)
started it was started by uh like will (20:04 - 20:11)
weaton and what Felicia Day I think and (20:08 - 20:13)
maybe a couple other people oh was (20:11 - 20:16)
Felicia Day part of that the start yes (20:13 - 20:19)
it was started by those two and it (20:16 - 20:22)
was very like board game it was it was (20:19 - 20:25)
when I was into board gaming and and (20:22 - 20:26)
there was like this board gaming Boost I (20:25 - 20:28)
was doing a board gaming podcast at the (20:26 - 20:33)
time so it was very much like a thing (20:28 - 20:35)
of like they took advantage of what was (20:33 - 20:37)
like definitely popular at the time (20:35 - 20:39)
board games are still popular I would (20:37 - 20:41)
argue they&#39;re may be more popular than (20:39 - 20:44)
they were then probably probably as (20:41 - 20:46)
somebody who is who is not in that space (20:44 - 20:49)
anymore I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m sure there are still (20:46 - 20:51)
hundreds of kickstarters of new board (20:49 - 20:52)
games and everything yes they&#39;re (20:51 - 20:55)
absolutely are yeah definitely still (20:52 - 20:58)
popular though um I don&#39;t I&#39;m pretty (20:55 - 21:01)
sure I&#39;m I&#39;m very confident that both (20:58 - 21:03)
will weaton and Felicia Day don&#39;t have (21:01 - 21:05)
anything to do with geek and sunry (21:03 - 21:08)
anymore and if and also in in my (21:05 - 21:10)
personal experience I forgot they (21:08 - 21:13)
existed and then when I when I went to (21:10 - 21:15)
their (21:13 - 21:18)
um when I went to their YouTube (21:15 - 21:21)
channel uh they didn&#39;t post a video in a (21:18 - 21:24)
full year and then a month ago so they (21:21 - 21:27)
took a whole year off and then a month (21:24 - 21:30)
ago they they seed a new DND D thing (21:27 - 21:33)
which is what you would probably know (21:30 - 21:35)
them for is like D and D thing and then (21:33 - 21:38)
they suddenly did a collaboration with (21:35 - 21:40)
Pokemon and I think they have like three (21:38 - 21:45)
episodes of that uh (21:40 - 21:45)
in uh according to the Pokemon press (21:45 - 21:51)
release to uh yeah a three episode (21:47 - 21:54)
miniseries for Stellar Crown Showdown (21:51 - 21:56)
premiering on geek and (21:54 - 21:59)
sunry those are all out one was with (21:56 - 22:03)
Terry Cruz one was with Jacob B balone I (21:59 - 22:05)
don&#39;t know who that is uh and then one (22:03 - 22:07)
was with Abigail brein I don&#39;t know who (22:05 - 22:12)
that is either what uh maybe Little Miss (22:07 - 22:16)
Sunshine I know of that movie (22:12 - 22:20)
name I don&#39;t what (22:16 - 22:24)
what really (22:20 - 22:26)
okay okay I don&#39;t think this (22:24 - 22:29)
collaboration is that weird because geek (22:26 - 22:30)
sunry did like card games and board (22:29 - 22:34)
games and that stuff I do think it&#39;s (22:30 - 22:37)
weird of how does this exist like this (22:34 - 22:41)
YouTube channel was dead for a full year (22:37 - 22:42)
someone was trying to get back up and (22:41 - 22:44)
running and made a (22:42 - 22:47)
deal that doesn&#39;t surprise (22:44 - 22:50)
me I guess (22:47 - 22:54)
yes I mean they had a pretty big follow (22:50 - 22:55)
they&#39;ve had a pretty big following for (22:54 - 22:59)
quite a while right so that can still (22:55 - 23:00)
have some holding power as (22:59 - 23:03)
well just cuz they took a break and I (23:00 - 23:04)
mean we you you know that they don&#39;t (23:03 - 23:06)
have YouTube you didn&#39;t they didn&#39;t do (23:04 - 23:09)
any YouTube stuff for the last year but (23:06 - 23:10)
have they been doing other things over (23:09 - 23:12)
the last I know I I always thought they (23:10 - 23:13)
were (23:12 - 23:16)
primarily YouTube because that&#39;s how (23:13 - 23:17)
they (23:16 - 23:19)
debuted yeah that can happen I had (23:17 - 23:21)
honestly thought that maybe they were (23:19 - 23:24)
one of the channels that had moved over (23:21 - 23:26)
to and I know almost nothing about them (23:24 - 23:28)
I just recognize the name I figured (23:26 - 23:30)
maybe they&#39;re one of the channels that (23:28 - 23:32)
moved to one of the more exclusive uh (23:30 - 23:35)
subscription based content websites that (23:32 - 23:38)
many of those types of channels have (23:35 - 23:43)
moved to at this point like a patreon (23:38 - 23:43)
patreon um no that that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s (23:44 - 23:48)
a good (23:47 - 23:52)
point I I just think like the deal (23:48 - 23:55)
of not making videos for a year and then (23:52 - 23:56)
coming back and then working with (23:55 - 23:59)
Pokemon is is (23:56 - 24:02)
like obviously it happened and if there (23:59 - 24:04)
are people who know people that&#39;s like (24:02 - 24:05)
the easiest way it happens it just seems (24:04 - 24:07)
a (24:05 - 24:09)
little (24:07 - 24:12)
weird yeah maybe I mean people know (24:09 - 24:15)
people conversations (24:12 - 24:17)
happen yeah okay I don&#39;t think will (24:15 - 24:19)
weaton was a Founder I have the a (24:17 - 24:21)
Founder was Felicia (24:19 - 24:24)
Day but I believe will weaton was on a (24:21 - 24:27)
lot of early stuff but it doesn&#39;t look (24:24 - 24:30)
like she&#39;s associated with it anymore (24:27 - 24:30)
yeah it does look like they&#39;re really (24:30 - 24:35)
jumping back in with I&#39;m just looking at (24:33 - 24:37)
like their video history like you said (24:35 - 24:38)
so it was like a year ago then like you (24:37 - 24:40)
said a month ago and then they&#39;ve kind (24:38 - 24:42)
of been just in the last month I feel (24:40 - 24:44)
like they&#39;ve pumped out (24:42 - 24:48)
like eight nine videos even before the (24:44 - 24:51)
Pokemon Showdown stuff so yeah it looks (24:48 - 24:53)
like they may have been it looks like (24:51 - 24:54)
geek and Sundre may have been dealing (24:53 - 24:57)
with a lawsuit from will Weeden in the (24:54 - 24:58)
last couple of years so maybe that&#39;s why (24:57 - 25:00)
weren&#39;t making any videos you know (24:58 - 25:02)
what&#39;s funny is somebody asked on (25:00 - 25:04)
threads who was a celebrity that like (25:02 - 25:07)
you had a bad experience with and I (25:04 - 25:08)
literally responded to this like two (25:07 - 25:10)
hours before and I didn&#39;t even think (25:08 - 25:12)
about it but my answer was will weaton (25:10 - 25:14)
that guy was that guy was one of the (25:12 - 25:18)
biggest jerks I&#39;ve ever met in real life (25:14 - 25:23)
i i s I saw him at Gen Con and he the (25:18 - 25:25)
way he just interacted with everyone (25:23 - 25:30)
around him was so offputting (25:25 - 25:30)
so for Hannah to be like ah I think (25:30 - 25:34)
they&#39;re dealing with a lawsuit like yeah (25:32 - 25:37)
yeah I think that checks out I mean I&#39;ve (25:34 - 25:39)
liked some of Will weaton I don&#39;t know (25:37 - 25:42)
that sucks that&#39;s how (25:39 - 25:45)
yeah uh Never metet Your Heroes Steve I (25:42 - 25:47)
wouldn&#39;t say he was a hero but it was (25:45 - 25:49)
like ah you&#39;re on that YouTube with the (25:47 - 25:50)
board games and that&#39;s cool and then (25:49 - 25:53)
you&#39;re like oh maybe you&#39;re not that (25:50 - 25:55)
cool I don&#39;t know maybe somebody else (25:53 - 25:58)
had a better experience meeting him but (25:55 - 25:59)
I didn&#39;t even like get a chance to like (25:58 - 26:01)
talk to him it was just like close (25:59 - 26:05)
enough to obser observe how he was like (26:01 - 26:06)
talking and communicating with other (26:05 - 26:09)
people and I was like (26:06 - 26:09)
oh may maybe I get out of this line (26:10 - 26:15)
right (26:12 - 26:15)
now so geek and sunre was founded in (26:15 - 26:22)
2011 uh it launched its official channel (26:18 - 26:24)
in 2012 12 years (26:22 - 26:29)
ago Felicia Day left in 2016 so four (26:24 - 26:33)
years after starting it (26:29 - 26:35)
okay um I wonder if this is like a (26:33 - 26:38)
situation (26:35 - 26:38)
where they sold it to somebody or there (26:38 - 26:44)
was like there was an exchange of like (26:41 - 26:47)
we just want to buy this brand and this (26:44 - 26:50)
brand has this Archive of videos and now (26:47 - 26:51)
there&#39;s the there there has it has to be (26:50 - 26:52)
something like that where now there&#39;s a (26:51 - 26:55)
new team behind it who is doing this new (26:52 - 26:57)
D and D show what it called go Goblin (26:55 - 27:01)
mode um and those people had connections (26:57 - 27:03)
with people at the Pokemon company and (27:01 - 27:07)
they were able to do this Pokemon thing (27:03 - 27:09)
um which like I don&#39;t know you have a (27:07 - 27:11)
YouTube channel with 2.3 million (27:09 - 27:13)
subscribers there&#39;s probably some value (27:11 - 27:14)
there even if you haven&#39;t posted a video (27:13 - 27:16)
in a (27:14 - 27:19)
year yeah it&#39;s possible I I like the (27:16 - 27:22)
fact that you can&#39;t you like really have (27:19 - 27:25)
to figure out how this is possible I (27:22 - 27:26)
think think that&#39;s the most I think that (27:25 - 27:30)
I think how a dead YouTube channel comes (27:26 - 27:32)
back with a Pokemon collaboration is way (27:30 - 27:34)
more interesting than Watching Terry (27:32 - 27:37)
Cruz just play (27:34 - 27:37)
Pokemon I think the answer is the 2.3 (27:37 - 27:43)
million subscribers number and (27:40 - 27:46)
connections I mean Terry Cruz playing (27:43 - 27:48)
hydrael got 97,000 views so that&#39;s (27:46 - 27:51)
pretty good (27:48 - 27:54)
yeah this is pretty (27:51 - 27:56)
good people like Terry Cruz people like (27:54 - 27:59)
hydrael it&#39;s a good (27:56 - 28:01)
guess that is a really good (27:59 - 28:03)
combination all right all right all (28:01 - 28:05)
right uh let&#39;s take a quick break uh (28:03 - 28:07)
when we come back uh I will we&#39;ll recap (28:05 - 28:10)
the the Korea event and then we have the (28:07 - 28:12)
the new Pokemon scam to talk about so we (28:10 - 28:15)
will be right (28:12 - 28:15)
back and we are back from our (28:18 - 28:27)
break uh there are four big Pokémon go (28:21 - 28:30)

8th and I just got back from Pokemon (28:55 - 29:03)
go Safari Zone not to be confused with (29:00 - 29:07)
City Safari in (29:03 - 29:11)
Sean um and I I I think as a uh (29:07 - 29:14)
Pokemon go (29:11 - 29:16)
event I think it was really (29:14 - 29:18)
good uh which is funny because this is (29:16 - 29:20)
the one Niantic didn&#39;t pay for and I&#39;m (29:18 - 29:22)
saying it&#39;s good and the one Niantic did (29:20 - 29:25)
pay for I&#39;m saying wasn&#39;t that good I I (29:22 - 29:27)
I think the I think the one in Jakarta (29:25 - 29:29)
was like completely (29:27 - 29:35)
fine um but I I just think that like the (29:29 - 29:37)
the pro I don&#39;t want to say like jardo (29:35 - 29:39)
was the problem it was just like really (29:37 - 29:42)
hard to get around uh which I think I (29:39 - 29:46)
expressed that episode um and I think (29:42 - 29:47)
like (29:46 - 29:49)
[Music] (29:47 - 29:51)
why part of the reason why I personally (29:49 - 29:54)
like Pokemon go so much is being able to (29:51 - 29:57)
explore and walk around when when (29:54 - 29:59)
Pokémon go (29:57 - 30:02)
first came out that was like everyone (29:59 - 30:03)
remembers that everyone was like going (30:02 - 30:05)
to parks and walking around and seeing (30:03 - 30:07)
people and then kind of as Pokemon go (30:05 - 30:09)
grew and got (30:07 - 30:12)
stale I was this is just my personal (30:09 - 30:15)
experience I was playing at the time (30:12 - 30:17)
with people who didn&#39;t want to walk they (30:15 - 30:20)
wanted to get into a car and they wanted (30:17 - 30:23)
to drive around MH popular (30:20 - 30:26)
areas (30:23 - 30:29)
and like drive slow enough (30:26 - 30:31)
to to like get the spawns that&#39;s how (30:29 - 30:32)
they wanted to spend Community Days (30:31 - 30:34)
that&#39;s how they wanted to spend events (30:32 - 30:37)
and I hated it I just didn&#39;t like I I (30:34 - 30:40)
think we&#39;ve all been a passenger in a (30:37 - 30:43)
car playing Pokemon go and it&#39;s it&#39;s (30:40 - 30:47)
fine it rarely (30:43 - 30:47)
works yeah yeah it&#39;s okay yeah like yes (30:47 - 30:55)
it is okay like I I enjoy walking I (30:53 - 30:58)
enjoy being able to like (30:55 - 31:01)
WKA City and I think that was my (30:58 - 31:04)
biggest downfall to Jakarta because it (31:01 - 31:06)
was like this area is really cool and (31:04 - 31:10)
now I&#39;ve explored it and do I want to (31:06 - 31:13)
sit 35 minutes in traffic to another (31:10 - 31:15)
area I haven&#39;t been at I don&#39;t know how (31:13 - 31:17)
big that area is and that&#39;s like part (31:15 - 31:19)
and part of like me not knowing the city (31:17 - 31:22)
that well um but I think like as an (31:19 - 31:24)
event like nothing was like broken like (31:22 - 31:27)
everything wor it was fine like I had a (31:24 - 31:30)
good time still so and I mean to your (31:27 - 31:31)
point there&#39;s one there&#39;s one thing (31:30 - 31:33)
where is you&#39;re playing Pokémon go in a (31:31 - 31:36)
car and you&#39;re playing the entire time (31:33 - 31:37)
you&#39;re going to a place where you know (31:36 - 31:39)
you&#39;re going to get spawns by like (31:37 - 31:41)
slowly driving around and all the (31:39 - 31:44)
passengers are playing which disclaimer (31:41 - 31:46)
like I I live in a place where I can (31:44 - 31:49)
play outside year round so I I do get it (31:46 - 31:52)
for like places where it&#39;s really cold (31:49 - 31:55)
for a good part of the year and you (31:52 - 31:57)
can&#39;t or really hot temperature either (31:55 - 32:01)
direction fing around so like not saying (31:57 - 32:03)
like you can&#39;t play that way or like (32:01 - 32:04)
that&#39;s like worse to play I mean that (32:03 - 32:06)
people play how they want to play yeah (32:04 - 32:08)
I&#39;m just saying my preference is walking (32:06 - 32:10)
walking yeah same but to your point (32:08 - 32:13)
you&#39;re also talking about not only (32:10 - 32:15)
playing Pokemon go but having to travel (32:13 - 32:19)
along like for 30 to 40 minutes to play (32:15 - 32:21)
Pokemon Go in different areas which is (32:19 - 32:24)
like that&#39;s even that&#39;s even different (32:21 - 32:26)
than actually playing to the rural (32:24 - 32:28)
experience in some ways which is why (32:26 - 32:31)
people in a lot of rural areas just (32:28 - 32:33)
can&#39;t and don&#39;t play (32:31 - 32:38)
mhm yeah so so that experience at inchan (32:33 - 32:41)
so the the the just if you didn&#39;t listen (32:38 - 32:44)
to last week&#39;s episode Jakarta was a (32:41 - 32:46)
city experience you could play anywhere (32:44 - 32:48)
in the city and there was really like (32:46 - 32:50)
eight designated spots where they were (32:48 - 32:53)
like here is where you should play not (32:50 - 32:55)
like should but like these are (32:53 - 32:57)
recommended play areas where there will (32:55 - 32:58)
be a lot of spawns will be a lot lot of (32:57 - 33:00)
stops we&#39;ll be the EV stops so you can (32:58 - 33:02)
get the (33:00 - 33:05)
EVS inhan was in a (33:02 - 33:11)
park um and an absolutely gorgeous Park (33:05 - 33:14)
uh not the biggest park I&#39;ve ever played (33:11 - 33:17)
in U but not the smallest uh gorgeous (33:14 - 33:20)
really great weather was perfect I mean (33:17 - 33:21)
a little a little bit on the hot side (33:20 - 33:24)
but very good weather and then this was (33:21 - 33:27)
uh an experience where you would get one (33:24 - 33:30)
day in the Park and then anywhere in (33:27 - 33:32)
inan and Inon is the third biggest city (33:30 - 33:35)
in Korea very big you could just play (33:32 - 33:36)
anywhere (33:35 - 33:39)
else (33:36 - 33:43)
and it was to me a much better (33:39 - 33:47)
experience because it was so easy to get (33:43 - 33:51)
around and see new places like just (33:47 - 33:53)
being able to like get on the subway and (33:51 - 33:55)
even going like one station over which (33:53 - 33:56)
is only like 5 minutes and being like (33:55 - 33:59)
okay we&#39;re in a brand new area cuz like (33:56 - 34:01)
five minutes on the subway took (33:59 - 34:04)
us took us much farther than where we (34:01 - 34:07)
were so just being able to like walk (34:04 - 34:10)
outside of the park and be like here&#39;s a (34:07 - 34:13)
7-Eleven or here&#39;s a CU you which is (34:10 - 34:15)
like their another version of 7-Eleven (34:13 - 34:17)
or here&#39;s a restaurant or here&#39;s a Toys (34:15 - 34:21)
R Us us or here&#39;s a mall like you just (34:17 - 34:22)
didn&#39;t get that same experience in (34:21 - 34:24)
Jakarta cuz (34:22 - 34:27)
like that little place that you&#39;re (34:24 - 34:29)
playing is all surrounded by roads and (34:27 - 34:32)
highways that like there&#39;s not like a (34:29 - 34:33)
park you can walk over to or there&#39;s not (34:32 - 34:35)
like a small like cini you could walk (34:33 - 34:37)
into and just like get something it was (34:35 - 34:39)
just like you&#39;re here now and if you (34:37 - 34:43)
want to leave you need a car yeah (34:39 - 34:45)
yep (34:43 - 34:48)
um uh and they also had like I didn&#39;t (34:45 - 34:49)
get a chance to do it they also had like (34:48 - 34:53)
tour bust set up um so you could get on (34:49 - 34:55)
a tour bus take the tour bus to another (34:53 - 34:58)
stop get off play in that area cuz the (34:55 - 35:00)
tour bus would come every hour and then (34:58 - 35:02)
get back on the tour bus and then go (35:00 - 35:03)
somewhere else which I think some (35:02 - 35:05)
players did in New (35:03 - 35:07)
York uh because New York also has like (35:05 - 35:11)
tour bus uh during the New York oest so (35:07 - 35:13)
it it it was set up much much better but (35:11 - 35:15)
again I don&#39;t when I complained last (35:13 - 35:19)
week about it I just think the the the (35:15 - 35:21)
the city choice of inchan was a good (35:19 - 35:25)
choice mhm as as like a a city that is (35:21 - 35:30)
set up with with buses and Bo and cars (35:25 - 35:34)
and bikes uh and taxis and Ubers like (35:30 - 35:38)
there were but also you could just walk (35:34 - 35:41)
right whereas Jakarta (35:38 - 35:43)
was bikes you have bikes as in (35:41 - 35:46)
motorcycles not like bicycles and you (35:43 - 35:48)
have cars that&#39;s it those (35:46 - 35:50)
are yeah so I had a I had a really good (35:48 - 35:52)
experience (35:50 - 35:57)
um it was like spawn wise like not that (35:52 - 36:00)
exciting the difference there was no (35:57 - 36:04)
Eevee spawns at this event uh I think (36:00 - 36:09)
there eeve are for City safaris okay (36:04 - 36:14)
this Safari zones Safari Zone both had (36:09 - 36:16)
sco okay but the difference was the (36:14 - 36:20)
Safari Zone had the scoo wave at the (36:16 - 36:22)
start of every hour for two minutes MH (36:20 - 36:24)
so all the Pokemon would be skadoo on (36:22 - 36:28)
the hour for uh at the start and the (36:24 - 36:31)
other thing they did which Jakarta (36:28 - 36:32)
didn&#39;t (36:31 - 36:37)
have was uh in field research the safari (36:32 - 36:41)
hat Pikachu or the skadoo could have a (36:37 - 36:46)
inchon background behind it oh okay (36:41 - 36:49)
which was cool to have whereas in (36:46 - 36:52)
Jakarta they had the megal Latios and (36:49 - 36:54)
megal Latias because it was technically (36:52 - 36:57)
like Pikachu&#39;s Air Adventure as well MH (36:54 - 37:00)
um and those two Pokemon had the Jakarta (36:57 - 37:04)
background behind it sometimes right (37:00 - 37:07)
right uh so that that was like cool to (37:04 - 37:09)
see but I I think overall the spawns in (37:07 - 37:13)
Inon were not like that great but also (37:09 - 37:16)
like even though that&#39;s like a negative (37:13 - 37:18)
100% a negative to be like ah the spawns (37:16 - 37:22)
to this event is not that great it (37:18 - 37:26)
does almost like alleviate some pressure (37:22 - 37:28)
of like I need to play play Super (37:26 - 37:31)
hardcore where it was like okay I don&#39;t (37:28 - 37:33)
feel as (37:31 - 37:37)
bad taking longer to get lunch or taking (37:33 - 37:40)
or or like on Sunday I missed the first (37:37 - 37:41)
two hours of the event because I was (37:40 - 37:43)
recording the podcast but I was like (37:41 - 37:46)
it&#39;s okay it&#39;s fine right right were (37:43 - 37:48)
there were there any timed researches (37:46 - 37:52)
that needed to get done during the event (37:48 - 37:54)
or I guess for either event was there (37:52 - 37:55)
anything like that both had time to (37:54 - 37:56)
research but they were the easiest (37:55 - 37:58)
things in the world it was you know give (37:56 - 38:00)
your buddy (37:58 - 38:04)
three berries and pet them and catch 15 (38:00 - 38:06)
Pokemon and spin five stops they were (38:04 - 38:07)
like the (38:06 - 38:11)
easiest and I think both awarded sco at (38:07 - 38:15)
the at the very end okay um also for (38:11 - 38:17)
like the the the park experience in (38:15 - 38:20)
inchan there was no egg bonus there was (38:17 - 38:23)
no raid bonus there was none of that (38:20 - 38:26)
none the only add-on was it do you want (38:23 - 38:30)
to play in the city on your non-park day (38:26 - 38:33)
uh whereas the city Safari had egg bonus (38:30 - 38:36)
raid bonus lover like it had more (38:33 - 38:38)
add-ons (38:36 - 38:41)
so what was so what was the length of (38:38 - 38:44)
the Jakarta event Pokemon go event and (38:41 - 38:47)
what was the length of the uh inan uh (38:44 - 38:51)
Pokemon go event Jakarta was just two (38:47 - 38:53)
days it was just Saturday and Sunday uh (38:51 - 38:55)
inchan was three days it was Friday (38:53 - 38:58)
Saturday Sunday (38:55 - 39:00)
if if you were to watch my twitch (38:58 - 39:02)
streams for (39:00 - 39:05)
Friday it would you would you would have (39:02 - 39:06)
the perception of (39:05 - 39:09)
like no one is coming to this event like (39:06 - 39:12)
where is everyone got it it looked it (39:09 - 39:16)
looked and felt so dead really at the (39:12 - 39:18)
park you mean at the park and I talked (39:16 - 39:22)
to a couple Korean YouTubers and they (39:18 - 39:24)
they all said the same thing which was (39:22 - 39:27)
it is really hard for anyone who has a 9 (39:24 - 39:31)
to-5 job in Korea to just get off on (39:27 - 39:35)
Friday um and Friday was amazing in the (39:31 - 39:37)
park because it was it actually it (39:35 - 39:39)
wasn&#39;t busy you could move around easier (39:37 - 39:41)
there was no lines for anything cell (39:39 - 39:43)
service was great (39:41 - 39:47)
Saturday not not as good um there were (39:43 - 39:48)
there were dead spots in the park all of (39:47 - 39:52)
a sudden there were just a lot of people (39:48 - 39:54)
um it was a little bit hotter on (39:52 - 39:58)
Saturday and because my service wasn&#39;t (39:54 - 40:00)
as good I we we played mostly outside (39:58 - 40:04)
the park which is totally fine um you (40:00 - 40:07)
well you got you you were special in (40:04 - 40:08)
that you could have gone to the park all (40:07 - 40:11)
three days right whereas most attendees (40:08 - 40:12)
are only going one day and then their (40:11 - 40:14)
City experience the other two if they (40:12 - 40:18)
choose to buy that expansion to it yes (40:14 - 40:20)
yes even though Niantic did not pay for (40:18 - 40:23)
my hotel or flights in Korea I did have (40:20 - 40:25)
the (40:23 - 40:27)
special content creator ticket or (40:25 - 40:30)
whatever ever I could see spawns in the (40:27 - 40:33)
park all three days so a standard player (40:30 - 40:35)
who had bought the ticket for one of the (40:33 - 40:37)
weekend days if they had been running (40:35 - 40:39)
into those dead spots and the spawns (40:37 - 40:41)
weren&#39;t very great this may have not (40:39 - 40:45)
been a very good event maybe um even if (40:41 - 40:46)
you still had the park ticket it still (40:45 - 40:49)
worked anywhere yeah but you want the (40:46 - 40:51)
park to work but yeah you want the park (40:49 - 40:52)
to work right I mean that&#39;s like that&#39;s (40:51 - 40:54)
kind of the idea for a safari zone is (40:52 - 40:58)
the the park experience I guess with (40:54 - 41:00)
was there a merch stand at this event at (40:58 - 41:03)
all no (41:00 - 41:06)
merch well they have Pokemon stores (41:03 - 41:08)
there they have POA they have a lot of (41:06 - 41:10)
they don&#39;t have Pokemon centers there (41:08 - 41:12)
but they do have a lot of they do have (41:10 - 41:14)
events where there are Pokemon popup (41:12 - 41:18)
stores yeah yes got it got it and Toys R (41:14 - 41:19)
Us does have collaborations with Pokemon (41:18 - 41:22)
so because there are still Toys R Us in (41:19 - 41:25)
South Korea they usually have a Pokemon (41:22 - 41:29)
Zone inside there are toys Us in America (41:25 - 41:32)
by the way people there&#39;s literally one (41:29 - 41:33)
down the street for me I keep forgetting (41:32 - 41:36)
but yes if you go I mean I I&#39;m assuming (41:33 - 41:37)
this is what you mean but like I know (41:36 - 41:39)
for for here if you go to a a (41:37 - 41:42)
Macy&#39;s uh department store there is like (41:39 - 41:46)
a Toys R Us area (41:42 - 41:48)
within those department stores at least (41:46 - 41:50)
here in (41:48 - 41:52)
California yeah all America has a Toys R (41:50 - 41:56)
Us okay got just it it it smells like (41:52 - 41:58)
Toys R Us (41:56 - 42:01)
is it like a standalone toys or a store (41:58 - 42:03)
yeah or is Standalone oh really okay so (42:01 - 42:04)
I didn&#39;t even know they had that I just (42:03 - 42:07)
thought yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s very big too (42:04 - 42:08)
interesting because when they started to (42:07 - 42:10)
come back they were within department (42:08 - 42:15)
stores I believe it was Macy&#39;s had them (42:10 - 42:17)
as an area and so like around here that (42:15 - 42:19)
is how it is so like they don&#39;t have a (42:17 - 42:21)
standalone Toys R A store but there&#39;s a (42:19 - 42:24)
Macy&#39;s like home store where they sell (42:21 - 42:26)
all the like furniture and bedding and (42:24 - 42:29)
stuff and there&#39;s also a Toys R Us like (42:26 - 42:32)
area within that department store (42:29 - 42:34)
so (42:32 - 42:35)
yeah (42:34 - 42:37)
[Music] (42:35 - 42:40)
uh yeah it it it was it was a both (42:37 - 42:44)
events were good and both events (42:40 - 42:49)
were different enough (42:44 - 42:52)
to Warrant having different names I (42:49 - 42:54)
don&#39;t I still think that&#39;s very (42:52 - 42:57)
confusing for like a a casual player (42:54 - 43:02)
like City Safari SL Safari Zone well I (42:57 - 43:03)
wouldn&#39;t think it would be that (43:02 - 43:06)
confusing except that the Safari Zone (43:03 - 43:07)
has a city (43:06 - 43:10)
experience so yeah at this point it&#39;s (43:07 - 43:13)
like that is like the city Safari at (43:10 - 43:14)
that point the other two days that (43:13 - 43:17)
you&#39;re not playing in the park is like a (43:14 - 43:19)
city Safari because you&#39;re just able to (43:17 - 43:22)
play in the city the Safari Zone is a (43:19 - 43:24)
city Safari but they also got the permit (43:22 - 43:27)
to be in a park so they can name it (43:24 - 43:30)
something different yeah I guess and you (43:27 - 43:32)
do have to pay for the park or for the (43:30 - 43:36)
city exp the city portion of a safari Z (43:32 - 43:38)
you can&#39;t just buy the city like you (43:36 - 43:40)
have to buy the park and then the city&#39;s (43:38 - 43:44)
an add-on add on the city (43:40 - 43:50)
yes um yeah yeah it&#39;s like I feel like (43:44 - 43:52)
the only (43:50 - 43:52)
thing signifying the Safari experience (43:53 - 43:59)
as sco at this point (43:56 - 43:59)
right that yeah that seems to be but (43:59 - 44:04)
like that&#39;s fine though I mean what (44:02 - 44:05)
they&#39;re really trying to do is just have (44:04 - 44:07)
events in other places right and they (44:05 - 44:10)
just want to give them a so you know (44:07 - 44:12)
that&#39;s okay like different names (44:10 - 44:13)
different I mean we have this wild area (44:12 - 44:14)
now coming as well right like how is (44:13 - 44:16)
that going to be you know like then now (44:14 - 44:18)
we have all these different events and (44:16 - 44:20)
that&#39;s that&#39;s fine as long as it allows (44:18 - 44:23)
them to get into more countries and (44:20 - 44:26)
cities I think that that works out well (44:23 - 44:28)
um I will say (44:26 - 44:30)
do you think did you have a good (44:28 - 44:33)
experience your whole travel experience (44:30 - 44:35)
that last couple of weeks would you say (44:33 - 44:36)
that was a good experience going to (44:35 - 44:38)
Jakarta doing the event there going to (44:36 - 44:40)
Korea doing the event there coming back (44:38 - 44:43)
did did you enjoy yourself in that yeah (44:40 - 44:47)
totally um I think (44:43 - 44:50)
uh I don&#39;t think every Pokemon go event (44:47 - 44:52)
has to be like a goest I actually think (44:50 - 44:54)
go Fest is kind of (44:52 - 44:58)
stressful as like a player um to like (44:54 - 45:00)
try to catch everything you want but (44:58 - 45:02)
also like stop and say hi to people and (45:00 - 45:04)
everyone has like different preferences (45:02 - 45:06)
and different tolerances right like even (45:04 - 45:09)
when me and Hannah were doing that our (45:06 - 45:12)
raid train like there was a balance of (45:09 - 45:15)
like are we going too fast are we going (45:12 - 45:19)
too slow um and there were some people (45:15 - 45:21)
we lose the group (45:19 - 45:23)
yeah and there were definitely some (45:21 - 45:25)
people that like left the ray train not (45:23 - 45:26)
that they weren&#39;t having a good time but (45:25 - 45:28)
they were like (45:26 - 45:30)
SP weren&#39;t going fast enough and the (45:28 - 45:33)
park wasn&#39;t helping yeah yeah the the (45:30 - 45:34)
park was very big but also the spawns in (45:33 - 45:36)
the park weren&#39;t as good as the spawns (45:34 - 45:38)
in the city so if you wanted to see two (45:36 - 45:39)
times or three times the amount of (45:38 - 45:43)
Pokemon you were better off going back (45:39 - 45:45)
into Midtown it wasn&#39;t just spawns there (45:43 - 45:48)
wasn&#39;t really signal yeah there was like (45:45 - 45:51)
a weird dead spot in near the the lake (45:48 - 45:52)
in the middle of the park kind of (45:51 - 45:55)
necessary for a game like this (45:52 - 45:59)
yeah I think that is one of the it&#39;s one (45:55 - 46:01)
of those things about Pokemon go and (45:59 - 46:04)
kind of like most Pokemon games that is (46:01 - 46:07)
it&#39;s good and it&#39;s bad right the the (46:04 - 46:08)
fact that you have the option to do so (46:07 - 46:10)
many different things and play so many (46:08 - 46:13)
different ways is is great right if you (46:10 - 46:15)
want to do a bunch of raids you can do a (46:13 - 46:17)
bunch of raids if you want to try to (46:15 - 46:20)
catch 47 zian you can try to catch 47 (46:17 - 46:22)
zian if you want to catch a bunch of (46:20 - 46:24)
Pokemon and not do any raids you can do (46:22 - 46:26)
that like you have so many different (46:24 - 46:28)
ways to play the game (46:26 - 46:30)
and I think that&#39;s great but it also (46:28 - 46:33)
makes these events like a go Fest where (46:30 - 46:35)
they want to incorporate all those ways (46:33 - 46:37)
of playing the game stressful because (46:35 - 46:40)
now it&#39;s like I&#39;ve got a raid to get (46:37 - 46:41)
this stuff and I&#39;ve got to catch all (46:40 - 46:43)
these Pokemon to do this thing and (46:41 - 46:45)
there&#39;s a research over here to do that (46:43 - 46:47)
thing and I have two days to do it where (46:45 - 46:50)
there are research and goals and awards (46:47 - 46:52)
and medals for all of these different (46:50 - 46:54)
things that you might not always focus (46:52 - 46:56)
on every single one of right and there&#39;s (46:54 - 46:58)
just a lot of that happening at the (46:56 - 47:01)
biggest events right and I feel like for (46:58 - 47:04)
most of the time you can kind of pick (47:01 - 47:06)
and choose what you want to do right (47:04 - 47:07)
when there&#39;s not like a big event going (47:06 - 47:09)
on like I can go raid or I can just (47:07 - 47:11)
catch stuff or I can do nothing I can (47:09 - 47:13)
you know take a break but when the event (47:11 - 47:15)
comes and you know it&#39;s like well here&#39;s (47:13 - 47:17)
what&#39;s at the event and you&#39;re paying (47:15 - 47:19)
for this event you kind of feel like (47:17 - 47:21)
well I want to get the most out of this (47:19 - 47:22)
I want to do all the things the event is (47:21 - 47:25)
providing me and then all of a sudden (47:22 - 47:28)
two days goes by and you&#39;re like I need (47:25 - 47:31)
a break like I all of a sudden realize I (47:28 - 47:32)
was really stressed out the last couple (47:31 - 47:35)
of days trying to complete everything (47:32 - 47:37)
and you know that&#39;s where like I said (47:35 - 47:40)
it&#39;s good and it&#39;s bad I think more good (47:37 - 47:42)
than bad like having all the options to (47:40 - 47:44)
do all those things is is a good thing (47:42 - 47:47)
but it can definitely wear on you a (47:44 - 47:50)
little bit especially in those bigger (47:47 - 47:54)
events yeah I I think Niantic did a good (47:50 - 47:58)
job of (47:54 - 47:58)
announcing some of these events early (47:58 - 48:05)
like we&#39;ve known about both the uh Hong (48:01 - 48:08)
Kong and Brazil pretty early (48:05 - 48:11)
and I do wish things were a little bit (48:08 - 48:14)
earlier uh like this is my third time (48:11 - 48:17)
going to Korea the first time I went was (48:14 - 48:19)
three years ago in goyang and I paid for (48:17 - 48:22)
that whole thing myself last year was in (48:19 - 48:25)
Soul Niantic did pay for that and then (48:22 - 48:29)
this year in inchon (48:25 - 48:31)
I I paid ultimately I paid for that you (48:29 - 48:34)
you could maybe say well I left Jakarta (48:31 - 48:36)
on a flight to Korea and technically I (48:34 - 48:37)
had to pay for that they were supposed (48:36 - 48:39)
to send me home but I was like No just (48:37 - 48:41)
send me to Korea I want to do this event (48:39 - 48:43)
too so I did have to pay for my own way (48:41 - 48:45)
home but (48:43 - 48:49)
like if if this is like the Korea thing (48:45 - 48:52)
I would always want to plan my visit to (48:49 - 48:56)
Korea around this the an event of this (48:52 - 48:58)
sort I don&#39;t really care what the event (48:56 - 49:01)
is but I I think going to Korea at the (48:58 - 49:03)
end of September early October is always (49:01 - 49:05)
good weatherwise I&#39;ve always had a great (49:03 - 49:08)
time I get to do Pokemon go technically (49:05 - 49:09)
I get to write that off as a business (49:08 - 49:11)
expense and like I love Korea as like a (49:09 - 49:14)
country of like to visit so it just like (49:11 - 49:17)
lines up perfectly there&#39;s another event (49:14 - 49:20)
coming another Pikachu&#39;s Indonesian (49:17 - 49:22)
Journey event happening in (49:20 - 49:25)
December and it&#39;s (49:22 - 49:27)
like who knows if there&#39;s a Pokemon go (49:25 - 49:28)
thing attached to it there probably will (49:27 - 49:30)
be cuz why there there has been every (49:28 - 49:34)
time but like would I go back to that no (49:30 - 49:38)
cuz that&#39;s expensive um and then there&#39;s (49:34 - 49:39)
the conversation of like am I going to (49:38 - 49:42)
go to Hong Kong or am I going to go to (49:39 - 49:45)
Brazil and like I thought about that and (49:42 - 49:48)
then they announced Fukuoka which is (49:45 - 49:51)
like I can&#39;t go to every Pokemon go (49:48 - 49:53)
event and this year (49:51 - 49:56)
specifically I I definitely came away (49:53 - 49:59)
from go Fest being like three go Fest is (49:56 - 50:00)
too (49:59 - 50:03)
many (50:00 - 50:05)
yeah like I went to the I went to the (50:03 - 50:06)
one in (50:05 - 50:09)
Japan in in Sendai that was great I went (50:06 - 50:12)
to the one in Madrid that was that was (50:09 - 50:13)
great and then I went to the one in New (50:12 - 50:16)
York and there there&#39;s a there&#39;s a cost (50:13 - 50:19)
thing to that like I paid the entire (50:16 - 50:21)
thing to Japan I paid the entire thing (50:19 - 50:25)
to Madrid I paid for the entire thing (50:21 - 50:28)
for New York until literally the last (50:25 - 50:29)
week where Niantic was like well we can (50:28 - 50:31)
at least pay for your hotel and I was (50:29 - 50:32)
like that&#39;s very nice of you sure I&#39;ll (50:31 - 50:35)
take the free Hotel you didn&#39;t like and (50:32 - 50:37)
I don&#39;t expect Niantic to pay for (50:35 - 50:38)
everything but sometimes they have (50:37 - 50:40)
budgets sometimes they want certain (50:38 - 50:43)
creators to show up yeah going to three (50:40 - 50:45)
go Fest is not a problem most people (50:43 - 50:49)
have um but my impression as someone (50:45 - 50:52)
who&#39;s only been to two go Fest and (50:49 - 50:54)
hasn&#39;t been to a safari zone just cuz (50:52 - 50:56)
travel is not usually a thing that I can (50:54 - 50:59)
do for one reason or another money or (50:56 - 51:00)
time or anything like that yeah or just (50:59 - 51:04)
like getting off work yeah yeah exactly (51:00 - 51:06)
um my impression with these different (51:04 - 51:08)
events is just that the big ones are (51:06 - 51:10)
really really good to go to for (51:08 - 51:15)
Community go fests or even the yearly (51:10 - 51:18)
Regional tours can be really good to go (51:15 - 51:21)
to for Community but things like Safari (51:18 - 51:24)
zones or city safaris are much better to (51:21 - 51:28)
go to if you&#39;re there I either as a (51:24 - 51:30)
local and you can travel there really (51:28 - 51:33)
easily or if you wanted to go there in (51:30 - 51:37)
the first place yes MH and you already (51:33 - 51:39)
had the (51:37 - 51:43)
means yeah yeah like if (51:39 - 51:46)
uh like I like many people who probably (51:43 - 51:48)
listen to this podcast love Japan and (51:46 - 51:50)
want to go back to Japan as often as (51:48 - 51:52)
possible Right like it&#39;s a cool country (51:50 - 51:55)
um so like when I&#39;m thinking of okay do (51:52 - 51:58)
I have the funds or the budget to go to (51:55 - 52:01)
Japan next year I would ideally in my (51:58 - 52:05)
head line that up with go Fest right yep (52:01 - 52:07)
um and that kind of restricts my like (52:05 - 52:10)
travel dates but also (52:07 - 52:13)
like I want to do go Fest and I want to (52:10 - 52:16)
go to Japan so but I I I I can&#39;t afford (52:13 - 52:18)
to go twice so let&#39;s just wait until (52:16 - 52:20)
they&#39;re together and then I can knock (52:18 - 52:22)
out both at the same time (52:20 - 52:27)
mhm anyways they have now announced the (52:22 - 52:28)
wild (52:27 - 52:31)
area which now that we know a little bit (52:28 - 52:34)
more about it it (52:31 - 52:34)
does seem maybe better than a safari (52:34 - 52:41)
zone but not as good as I don&#39;t know (52:38 - 52:43)
because like go Fest is like the (52:41 - 52:46)
Pinnacle right like go Fest is the thing (52:43 - 52:49)
that makes them the most money the thing (52:46 - 52:50)
that they hype up the thing they (52:49 - 52:54)
actually want you to travel to mhm so (52:50 - 52:56)
nothing&#39;s going to be as big as that but (52:54 - 52:57)
the the other thing we didn&#39;t mention (52:56 - 53:00)
with the the Safari Zone and the city (52:57 - 53:02)
Safari is like the (53:00 - 53:08)
tours like hoen tour and c tour MH I (53:02 - 53:11)
think are worth traveling to MH (53:08 - 53:15)
personally so this seems like a step (53:11 - 53:20)
maybe above Safari Zone but maybe but (53:15 - 53:22)
definitely below youo or not I&#39;m going (53:20 - 53:25)
to say Unova tour uh but c tour or hoen (53:22 - 53:29)
tour um They&#39;re bringing back uh Dian (53:25 - 53:32)
Pia in their origin (53:29 - 53:36)
form uh they&#39;re debuting the Safari Ball (53:32 - 53:38)
which in itself is pretty (53:36 - 53:40)
exciting they&#39;re introducing what&#39;s (53:38 - 53:43)
called Mighty Pokemon which are Pokemon (53:40 - 53:44)
that are more likely to have higher (53:43 - 53:48)
attack defense HP more likely to be XL (53:44 - 53:50)
or XXL more difficult to capture that&#39;s (53:48 - 53:55)
not a benefit um they can also be (53:50 - 53:58)
shiny uh and then using the Safari Ball (53:55 - 54:01)
on them will increase catch chances I do (53:58 - 54:04)
like this thematically the mighty (54:01 - 54:05)
Pokemon because if you&#39;ve ever played (54:04 - 54:08)
sword and shield there are in the wild (54:05 - 54:12)
area like gengars and snorlax&#39;s and what (54:08 - 54:14)
are supposed to (54:12 - 54:17)
be Mighty Pokemon I don&#39;t think they (54:14 - 54:20)
ever use the word mighty but like it (54:17 - 54:22)
does like I get what they&#39;re going for (54:20 - 54:25)
thematically that&#39;s cool and I think for (54:22 - 54:27)
a casual player (54:25 - 54:31)
seeing a Gyarados in the wild that can (54:27 - 54:35)
be shiny and that will have decent stats (54:31 - 54:37)
probably exciting Gyarados might not be (54:35 - 54:39)
the best example because it can already (54:37 - 54:41)
be shiny but there are others that they (54:39 - 54:44)
are introducing that could not I think I (54:41 - 54:46)
think there are others maybe not I&#39;m (54:44 - 54:47)
looking through the list of Mighty (54:46 - 54:49)
Pokemon most of them are are Pokemon (54:47 - 54:53)
that have had Community Days Community (54:49 - 54:58)
Days I have never seen a wild tantrum (54:53 - 55:00)
so seeing that in the (54:58 - 55:03)
wild pretty or electros right or drag (55:00 - 55:04)
algae I don&#39;t (55:03 - 55:07)
think some of these Pokemon could ever (55:04 - 55:08)
spawn like I don&#39;t think a mammo swine (55:07 - 55:12)
could ever spawn in the wild uh yeah I (55:08 - 55:13)
feel like seen swine but I can&#39;t (55:12 - 55:16)
remember where very rarely I think I (55:13 - 55:19)
think it&#39;s fine I I do think the (55:16 - 55:22)
addition of the Safari balls is cool but (55:19 - 55:25)
it&#39;s not like kind of reminds me of like (55:22 - 55:27)
the Beast ball like the way that they (55:25 - 55:29)
did the beastball right where like (55:27 - 55:31)
you&#39;re only catching specific like it&#39;s (55:29 - 55:38)
cool to catch necros beastball but um (55:31 - 55:42)
but like there&#39;s nothing more to that (55:38 - 55:43)
like you don&#39;t get to collect them you (55:42 - 55:45)
don&#39;t get to have them in your storage (55:43 - 55:46)
like you know and this is kind of the (55:45 - 55:47)
same thing that&#39;s going to happen with (55:46 - 55:50)
the Safari Ball I think I even saw that (55:47 - 55:52)
it said like after the event is over the (55:50 - 55:54)
Safari balls go away so like you it&#39;s (55:52 - 55:55)
not like you&#39;re going to be able to keep (55:54 - 55:58)
them and then use them anywhere else (55:55 - 56:01)
which is fine a little bit more thematic (55:58 - 56:04)
right but still like you know I don&#39;t (56:01 - 56:06)
know I I kind of hope they don&#39;t end up (56:04 - 56:10)
doing this for like more pokeballs where (56:06 - 56:11)
where it&#39;s not like we&#39;re going to be (56:10 - 56:12)
able to keep them and store them we&#39;re (56:11 - 56:14)
going to have to you said with the (56:12 - 56:17)
Safari Ball that&#39;s pretty thematic to be (56:14 - 56:19)
giving the Safari balls back at the end (56:17 - 56:21)
of the Safari Zone that matches with (56:19 - 56:24)
what we know from past Pokemon games but (56:21 - 56:26)
it&#39;s that&#39;s where it should be at Safari (56:24 - 56:27)
Zone (56:26 - 56:29)
I was going to say you would think the (56:27 - 56:31)
Safari balls would be available at (56:29 - 56:34)
Safari zones or city (56:31 - 56:39)
safaris yeah yeah I I think I I do like (56:34 - 56:41)
the introduction of the Safari Ball in (56:39 - 56:44)
the game I think that&#39;s (56:41 - 56:45)
cool (56:44 - 56:50)
um I I I think I share the (56:45 - 56:52)
same uh opinions as what I&#39;ve been (56:50 - 56:55)
seeing online which is the spawns (56:52 - 56:58)
between the electric hour and the poison (56:55 - 57:00)
hour don&#39;t seem that (56:58 - 57:06)
great um I think the debut of toxtricity (57:00 - 57:09)
is is cool really interesting that (57:06 - 57:11)
there&#39;s no gigantamax form it is just (57:09 - 57:14)
Dynamax toxcity uh and then toxil being (57:11 - 57:16)
in 10k eggs is like whatever it&#39;s a baby (57:14 - 57:18)
Pokemon of course it would be in (57:16 - 57:21)
eggs uh (57:18 - 57:25)
like we said this about cotour when they (57:21 - 57:28)
announced cotour and we were like it&#39;s (57:25 - 57:31)
so close to being (57:28 - 57:34)
good and they did add a couple more (57:31 - 57:36)
things like leading up to cotour and (57:34 - 57:38)
we&#39;re like okay like they added enough (57:36 - 57:41)
where it feels better I do think that (57:38 - 57:44)
this is missing something I I&#39;m gonna be (57:41 - 57:46)
the guy that says this I think it&#39;s (57:44 - 57:50)
missing a hat Pikachu like there there (57:46 - 57:50)
is they there like an electric hour and (57:50 - 57:56)
there&#39;s no Pikachu spawns here like they (57:54 - 57:58)
they have to be announcing a Pikachu (57:56 - 58:00)
closer to the (57:58 - 58:04)
event yeah yeah it is I think the one (58:00 - 58:06)
thing that is kind of weird about it is (58:04 - 58:09)
that it&#39;s an event similar to say a (58:06 - 58:12)
safari zone similar to a tour similar to (58:09 - 58:15)
something like that and then they&#39;ve (58:12 - 58:18)
really restricted what is actually there (58:15 - 58:20)
so like you said like electric and (58:18 - 58:23)
poison is kind of weird that those are (58:20 - 58:26)
the only two types of Pokemon outside (58:23 - 58:28)
the mighty Pokémon that are going to be (58:26 - 58:32)
spawning it it like am I missing like (58:28 - 58:33)
are there going to be other stuff (58:32 - 58:34)
spawning or is it literally just going (58:33 - 58:36)
to be electric and poison Pokemon for (58:34 - 58:38)
two days like for the for for the record (58:36 - 58:40)
we are talking about the global one they (58:38 - 58:42)
haven&#39;t really shown (58:40 - 58:45)
specifically Fukuoka (58:42 - 58:47)
which usually in person is better but (58:45 - 58:49)
they&#39;re saying it&#39;s going to be electric (58:47 - 58:51)
hour then poison hour then electric hour (58:49 - 58:53)
then poison hour and then these Mighty (58:51 - 58:54)
Pokemon will appear on Saturday and (58:53 - 58:56)
these Mighty Pokemon will appear on (58:54 - 58:57)
Sunday (58:56 - 58:59)
I&#39;m assuming the mighty Pokemon are (58:57 - 59:01)
going to be sprinkled in between (58:59 - 59:06)
the poison and electric hour yeah so I (59:01 - 59:07)
mean there like for an hour you&#39;re (59:06 - 59:11)
getting 12 different spawns plus Mighty (59:07 - 59:13)
Pokemon sprinkled (59:11 - 59:18)
in which is two four six two four eight (59:13 - 59:21)
eight different Pokemon each day but I (59:18 - 59:24)
mean yeah but usually usually they have (59:21 - 59:26)
rotations of four different habitats (59:24 - 59:27)
having (59:26 - 59:30)
only two different habitats is a (59:27 - 59:36)
little strange four is go Fest this is (59:30 - 59:40)
this is half the go Fest yeah yeah it&#39;s (59:36 - 59:42)
I don&#39;t know I again to your point like (59:40 - 59:45)
I feel like it&#39;s on the cusp of being (59:42 - 59:49)
like a good event but there are things (59:45 - 59:51)
about it that make me feel like I&#39;m (59:49 - 59:53)
gonna be and maybe this is not a bad (59:51 - 59:55)
thing maybe like the fact that it&#39;s two (59:53 - 59:59)
days and there&#39;s not a ton going on (59:55 - 60:01)
means it is open to more people like (59:59 - 60:03)
being able to play for shorter periods (60:01 - 60:07)
of time right like so it doesn&#39;t it (60:03 - 60:09)
doesn&#39;t feel like I have to play for you (60:07 - 60:12)
know from 10 to six both days things (60:09 - 60:15)
like that um but I think the people who (60:12 - 60:18)
do play 10 to six both days are in the (60:15 - 60:20)
minority and they&#39;re going to have a lot (60:18 - 60:27)
of spinner and volt or I I mean like (60:20 - 60:30)
I I do wish Niantic would like maybe (60:27 - 60:32)
reveal some demographics I don&#39;t think I (60:30 - 60:33)
don&#39;t think it would benefit them in any (60:32 - 60:37)
way but I&#39;ve been to (60:33 - 60:39)
so (60:37 - 60:41)
many (60:39 - 60:42)
events (60:41 - 60:46)
where people people leave (60:42 - 60:50)
like after like after lunch maybe 3 4:00 (60:46 - 60:51)
if the event is going till 6 people are (60:50 - 60:53)
leaving they&#39;re done for the day like (60:51 - 60:55)
it&#39;s really if you&#39;re if you&#39;re paying (60:53 - 60:59)
attention and if you&#39;re in the park well (60:55 - 61:00)
most people wouldn&#39;t be in the park (60:59 - 61:01)
every day cuz they wouldn&#39;t have a (61:00 - 61:03)
ticket but like (61:01 - 61:08)
um like I I I had a friend who came out (61:03 - 61:09)
from (61:08 - 61:12)
Soul which was for them they were on the (61:09 - 61:14)
far side of Soul so it was a 2-hour (61:12 - 61:16)
train ride they got in they literally (61:14 - 61:17)
played the event for two hours and they (61:16 - 61:20)
were like I&#39;m good it was fun I&#39;m okay (61:17 - 61:22)
and then they left and that was it they (61:20 - 61:23)
didn&#39;t they didn&#39;t do any of the add-ons (61:22 - 61:25)
they they came to the park they got (61:23 - 61:26)
their pictures they walked around the (61:25 - 61:29)
whole park like twice and they were good (61:26 - 61:32)
which and that is fine it&#39;s a totally (61:29 - 61:35)
valid way to play it&#39;s just not how yeah (61:32 - 61:38)
I I 40 minutes ago I was talking about (61:35 - 61:40)
how go Fest makes it&#39;s too stressful (61:38 - 61:41)
because there are too many different (61:40 - 61:43)
things to do I can&#39;t really go back and (61:41 - 61:46)
say there&#39;s not enough to do here you (61:43 - 61:50)
know it&#39;s very good to not be as reliant (61:46 - 61:52)
on that fear of missing out and just be (61:50 - 61:55)
able to say yep I&#39;m good and call the (61:52 - 61:57)
event when you feel like calling the (61:55 - 61:58)
event that is an important thing to be (61:57 - 62:02)
in tune with with yourself it&#39;s just (61:58 - 62:04)
just sometimes fun to play the entire (62:02 - 62:07)
event yeah also both are good both are (62:04 - 62:10)
fine but I will say the fact that it&#39;s (62:07 - 62:12)
like an so like just going back to the (62:10 - 62:15)
event as it as it is not like needing to (62:12 - 62:17)
play the whole thing or or whatever but (62:15 - 62:20)
electric hour poison hour that is very (62:17 - 62:23)
much like a research day right we&#39;ve had (62:20 - 62:25)
research days or was it research yeah (62:23 - 62:27)
research or maybe ins days incense days (62:25 - 62:30)
sorry incense days where it&#39;s like a six (62:27 - 62:33)
hour event and it is electric and poison (62:30 - 62:35)
or maybe steel and ghost or something (62:33 - 62:37)
like that and it just switches back and (62:35 - 62:39)
forth for six hours that&#39;s what this (62:37 - 62:42)
feels like you know it doesn&#39;t feel as (62:39 - 62:45)
much like an event as much as much as uh (62:42 - 62:46)
I guess those are events too but it (62:45 - 62:49)
doesn&#39;t like some weird incense day (62:46 - 62:53)
stretched in the direction of a regional (62:49 - 62:58)
tour yeah my guess would be that there (62:53 - 63:01)
is something else here that is going to (62:58 - 63:03)
be in F (63:01 - 63:05)
Fukuoka but they need to get something (63:03 - 63:08)
out to start selling tickets Yeah well (63:05 - 63:10)
yeah maybe maybe maybe they will have (63:08 - 63:15)
like gigantamax tcity in in Japan or (63:10 - 63:17)
something specifically you know they (63:15 - 63:19)
could do something like that because it (63:17 - 63:21)
to your point it feels very weird to (63:19 - 63:25)
introduce this as a wild area and not (63:21 - 63:28)
introduce it gigantamax Pokemon it (63:25 - 63:30)
they&#39;re also saying (63:28 - 63:34)
that these toxicities are in four star (63:30 - 63:37)
raids they&#39;re not even saying they&#39;re in (63:34 - 63:38)
there they&#39;re not even saying they&#39;re in (63:37 - 63:40)
Dynamax (63:38 - 63:42)
raids (63:40 - 63:46)
really huh hold on they have well maybe (63:42 - 63:48)
the I missed that that feels like maybe (63:46 - 63:49)
a (63:48 - 63:53)
typo what is a fourar RAID fourar raid a (63:49 - 63:54)
four-star raid is the raids that appear (63:53 - 63:57)
after Community Day yeah yeah so they&#39;re (63:54 - 63:59)
using the icon and they&#39;re literally (63:57 - 64:01)
saying fourstar raids for toxcity on (63:59 - 64:04)
their website and they&#39;re saying all of (64:01 - 64:05)
these raids can be accessed with a (64:04 - 64:07)
remote raid pass in addition to read (64:05 - 64:09)
premium only Pokemon caught from Max (64:07 - 64:10)
Raid Battle encounters as well their (64:09 - 64:12)
evolutions can be down onx string raid (64:10 - 64:14)
Powers but they&#39;re saying that toxcity (64:12 - 64:17)
will be in fourar raids but fourar raids (64:14 - 64:20)
are local yeah so are D supposed to be (64:17 - 64:23)
local that&#39;s why I&#39;m very (64:20 - 64:23)
confused cuz they&#39;re not cuz cuz they&#39;re (64:23 - 64:30)
not saying Dynamax raids they are saying (64:26 - 64:32)
uh the following Pokemon will appear in (64:30 - 64:35)
Max Max raid battles and now then (64:32 - 64:36)
they&#39;re (64:35 - 64:41)
showing toxcity amped and toxcity lowkey (64:36 - 64:44)
so and in a different section on the (64:41 - 64:47)
website I don&#39;t it would be a really big (64:44 - 64:50)
typo to put fourstar raids and the image (64:47 - 64:52)
of the egg that represents fourstar (64:50 - 64:54)
raids and then do a whole another (64:52 - 64:56)
section for Dynamax raids which has tox (64:54 - 64:59)
amped form and toxcity see what you&#39;re (64:56 - 65:02)
talking about now so are they putting (64:59 - 65:04)
toxcity in fourstar raids which B to (65:02 - 65:08)
Bobby&#39;s Point are local only but then (65:04 - 65:11)
turning on remote raid passes for them (65:08 - 65:14)
so people can just remote raid for (65:11 - 65:16)
toxcity and then are they also just (65:14 - 65:18)
putting toxcity in (65:16 - 65:22)
Max raids as well because those are (65:18 - 65:24)
different raid areas right they they (65:22 - 65:25)
don&#39;t take where they don&#39;t take up (65:24 - 65:26)
where (65:25 - 65:28)
I can&#39;t imagine there&#39;s not a typo in (65:26 - 65:31)
here somewhere I have to just assume (65:28 - 65:32)
that the fourstar raids that they are (65:31 - 65:34)
going to be in fourstar raids and they (65:32 - 65:38)
are going to be in the max battles but (65:34 - 65:41)
that the fourstar raids aren&#39;t are still (65:38 - 65:42)
going to be local only because that (65:41 - 65:48)
would be weird to switch now but to the (65:42 - 65:50)
I do understand like because of how (65:48 - 65:52)
they&#39;re doing Dynamax Pokemon and it not (65:50 - 65:54)
being that every Pokemon can Dynamax and (65:52 - 65:55)
then they still want people to be able (65:54 - 65:58)
to raid against toxitricity and so maybe (65:55 - 65:59)
you don&#39;t want to raid against the (65:58 - 66:01)
Dynamax toxitricity you just want a one (65:59 - 66:04)
that&#39;s not Dynamax gives you the ability (66:01 - 66:05)
to that the only reason to put a Pokemon (66:04 - 66:07)
in a four-star raid is to make it look (66:05 - 66:12)
lonely that&#39;s literally what they exist (66:07 - 66:15)
for well no they exist for Community Day (66:12 - 66:18)
to go longer than they exist because (66:15 - 66:20)
people wanted a six-hour community day (66:18 - 66:21)
like they used to do but they wanted to (66:20 - 66:23)
do a 3-hour community day so they&#39;re (66:21 - 66:24)
giving people that wanted that 6-hour (66:23 - 66:29)
Community Day a way to do that in some (66:24 - 66:32)
way po they&#39;re clearly stating on the (66:29 - 66:34)
website these will appear during raids (66:32 - 66:35)
and then there&#39;s a whole another section (66:34 - 66:37)
saying these will be appearing during (66:35 - 66:39)
Max raid battles and toxicity is in both (66:37 - 66:42)
yeah yes and by the way trainers may (66:39 - 66:46)
even encounter shiny TR toxcity if they (66:42 - 66:49)
are lucky so kind of (66:46 - 66:52)
cool yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s cool I think I&#39;m (66:49 - 66:56)
very confused why anyone would (66:52 - 66:58)
I I&#39;m not confused why somebody would if (66:56 - 67:00)
you could remote into a toxcity raid I&#39;m (66:58 - 67:02)
not confused about that because people (67:00 - 67:03)
would want that for their decks but if (67:02 - 67:09)
you have the option in person to do (67:03 - 67:13)
toxcity or Dynamax (67:09 - 67:16)
toxy you would do the two totally no (67:13 - 67:17)
they&#39;re two totally different things (67:16 - 67:19)
people may be prepared for one of those (67:17 - 67:21)
battles and totally unprepared for (67:19 - 67:23)
another yeah so for one to do a Dynamax (67:21 - 67:24)
toxcity you&#39;re going to have to have (67:23 - 67:28)
Dynamax Pokemon that are available to (67:24 - 67:32)
battle that toxity and right now there (67:28 - 67:34)
aren&#39;t any that are going to be good (67:32 - 67:38)
against Electric poison type Pokemon at (67:34 - 67:41)
the moment like a Dynamax Pokemon might (67:38 - 67:42)
get a ground type (67:41 - 67:46)
move but it right now it has Max (67:42 - 67:48)
whatever the normal you can change its (67:46 - 67:51)
Max move oh can you change it to a (67:48 - 67:54)
ground uh I know you can change it to (67:51 - 67:55)
dark I don&#39;t know if you can change it (67:54 - 67:57)
to ground (67:55 - 68:00)
okay the the max move is based off the (67:57 - 68:03)
fast move yes not the charged one yeah (68:00 - 68:05)
so you can so like I have a I have a (68:03 - 68:09)
Dynamax Charizard with Max Airstream or (68:05 - 68:10)
whatever and then I have a Dynamax (68:09 - 68:12)
Charizard with Max flare right for (68:10 - 68:15)
different situations yeah I don&#39;t know I (68:12 - 68:17)
just I think they&#39;re going to be very (68:15 - 68:21)
different raids and you&#39;re going to have (68:17 - 68:23)
to have the right Pokemon especially to (68:21 - 68:25)
do a Dynamax raid also the Dynamax raids (68:23 - 68:27)
are only going to be in person most (68:25 - 68:28)
likely you&#39;re not going to be remoting (68:27 - 68:30)
into a Dynamax raid right because that&#39;s (68:28 - 68:34)
how they&#39;ve set those up (68:30 - 68:36)
um it&#39;s going to be very different I (68:34 - 68:38)
think (68:36 - 68:43)
but I don&#39;t know again this this event (68:38 - 68:45)
seems okay I mean it&#39;s a free event (68:43 - 68:47)
right I mean there is a no it&#39;s not free (68:45 - 68:50)
it&#39;s $12 I think isn&#39;t it no for the (68:47 - 68:53)
bonuses but the event itself is free (68:50 - 68:55)
there&#39;s like an add-on to it I believe (68:53 - 68:59)
oh okay okay okay okay yeah right am I (68:55 - 69:02)
I&#39;m not the the global ticket is (68:59 - 69:04)
$12 and you get an encounter with (69:02 - 69:06)
toxcity you get up to five raid passes (69:04 - 69:08)
you get an increased chance of toxle you (69:06 - 69:12)
get six special trades get half egg two (69:08 - 69:16)
times candy for catching higher higher (69:12 - 69:18)
chance of shiny during the (69:16 - 69:21)
event so yes you&#39;re right the the event (69:18 - 69:25)
is free I am safe the weather is nice (69:21 - 69:27)
outside (69:25 - 69:31)
um but if you wanted the extra raid (69:27 - 69:33)
passes the special (69:31 - 69:38)
trades the half egg the double candy (69:33 - 69:40)
then it would be (69:38 - 69:40)
$12 yeah so I mean it being a free event (69:43 - 69:48)
for the parts of it that are you know (69:47 - 69:51)
the poison hour and electric hour and (69:48 - 69:53)
the raids and every I don&#39;t know that&#39;s (69:51 - 69:54)
fine I think that&#39;s what that&#39;s that&#39;s (69:53 - 69:59)
fine I I just I feel like again (69:54 - 70:03)
it&#39;s it could be a little bit better but (69:59 - 70:05)
I&#39;m sticking with the interpretation of (70:03 - 70:09)
this feels like an incense day in (70:05 - 70:11)
stretched into the shape of a regional (70:09 - 70:15)
tour because this is the payment style (70:11 - 70:18)
of a regional tour this is kind of the (70:15 - 70:20)
event style of a regional tour in some (70:18 - 70:24)
ways but I also think that with regional (70:20 - 70:26)
tours they have at least with the last (70:24 - 70:28)
one introduced an exciting new thing at (70:26 - 70:31)
the very last minute to get people hyped (70:28 - 70:33)
so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see that (70:31 - 70:36)
and it&#39;ll be Pikachu wearing a hat it&#39;ll (70:33 - 70:40)
probably be a Pikachu wearing a (70:36 - 70:43)
hat all trainers can enjoy the gameplay (70:40 - 70:44)
and the bonuses during the wild area (70:43 - 70:47)
whether they have a ticket or not (70:44 - 70:50)
mhm I think the ticket&#39;s a little (70:47 - 70:55)
expensive yep yep agreed like 12 bucks I (70:50 - 70:57)
don&#39;t know know you get you&#39;re getting (70:55 - 70:58)
five freed raid passes a day so if (70:57 - 70:59)
you&#39;re saying a raid pass is a dollar (70:58 - 71:01)
that&#39;s $10 out of $12 if you&#39;re doing (70:59 - 71:06)
all the raids sure um like half egg You (71:01 - 71:08)
could argue that there&#39;s value there (71:06 - 71:09)
double candy You could argue there&#39;s (71:08 - 71:12)
value I don&#39;t know you (71:09 - 71:12)
could if you&#39;re going to play both days (71:12 - 71:17)
and you&#39;re a hardcore player right sure (71:14 - 71:19)
$12 is probably nothing based on what (71:17 - 71:21)
you&#39;ve already spent on incubators or (71:19 - 71:25)
Raid passes right like but (71:21 - 71:27)
yeah it seems it seems a little (71:25 - 71:29)
expensive the bonuses are pretty good (71:27 - 71:32)
though I will I will admit (71:29 - 71:35)
that all of the bonuses you get for (71:32 - 71:36)
paying for the ticket are are pretty (71:35 - 71:39)
good bonuses and it&#39;s a lot of them so (71:36 - 71:43)
trying to see the benefit of that (71:39 - 71:45)
there (71:43 - 71:48)
yeah and do you think it&#39;s interesting (71:45 - 71:50)
that some of the Pokemon that are going (71:48 - 71:53)
to be able to be shiny to your point (71:50 - 71:56)
like haven&#39;t been shiny in the past like (71:53 - 71:59)
uh it looks like there are some Pokemon (71:56 - 72:01)
I guess it&#39;s the mighty Pokemon right so (71:59 - 72:03)
just seeing some of those evolved (72:01 - 72:06)
Pokemon that you usually can&#39;t see that (72:03 - 72:09)
evolved Pokemon in the wild as shiny is (72:06 - 72:11)
cool too most of them you&#39;ve been able (72:09 - 72:14)
to get shiny in the past if you evolv (72:11 - 72:15)
them but you haven&#39;t been able to (72:14 - 72:17)
encounter them as shiny in the wild (72:15 - 72:20)
before that is usually reserved to (72:17 - 72:25)
mega mega Pokemon yeah and that one time (72:20 - 72:28)
during um International women&#39;s day when (72:25 - 72:32)
nitan girl nitan female n Nina (72:28 - 72:34)
and could be shiny I got one of those I (72:32 - 72:36)
got a shiny NE (72:34 - 72:39)
Queen all right uh let&#39;s take uh our (72:36 - 72:40)
last break and then we come back we&#39;ll (72:39 - 72:42)
talk about uh the last two things we (72:40 - 72:45)
have on our notes so we will be right (72:42 - 72:49)
back and we are back from our break (72:45 - 72:51)
before we get to the scam stuff we&#39;re (72:49 - 72:53)
really we&#39;re really leading up to this (72:51 - 72:57)
uh Pokemon unite is shut down in Belgium (72:53 - 72:59)
and the Netherlands next year due to (72:57 - 73:01)
loot box (72:59 - 73:03)
restrictions uh we actually didn&#39;t talk (73:01 - 73:06)
about this last (73:03 - 73:11)
week in regards to TCG pocket but TCG (73:06 - 73:15)
pocket isn&#39;t available in some countries (73:11 - 73:16)
the same ones I believe Belgium and (73:15 - 73:20)
Netherlands because of ultimately loot (73:16 - 73:24)
boxes uh this is off Euro (73:20 - 73:28)
gamer uh Pokemon unite is being yanked (73:24 - 73:30)
offline in Belgium&#39;s and Netherlands (73:28 - 73:33)
from nove uh from November next year (73:30 - 73:35)
admit country&#39;s ongoing Crackdown of (73:33 - 73:38)
loot boxes all versions of unite Android (73:35 - 73:40)
iOS and switch will be pulled from (73:38 - 73:42)
digital stores on the 30th of November (73:40 - 73:45)
2025 but subscriptions and in-game items (73:42 - 73:47)
will cease to be available much earlier (73:45 - 73:49)
they will no longer be able to be (73:47 - 73:53)
purchased of O as of October 31st of (73:49 - 73:56)
this year the Pokemon company did right (73:53 - 73:58)
we&#39;d like to thank our players in (73:56 - 74:00)
Belgium and Netherlands for their (73:58 - 74:04)
support support and we apologize for any (74:00 - 74:06)
inconvenience uh while there&#39;s no reason (74:04 - 74:08)
for the game&#39;s termination provided by (74:06 - 74:10)
the Pokemon company&#39;s statement the (74:08 - 74:13)
decision is ultimately mostly related to (74:10 - 74:15)
the loot box restrictions in Belgium and (74:13 - 74:18)
Netherlands loot boxes have been illegal (74:15 - 74:21)
under Belgium&#39;s gambling law since 2018 (74:18 - 74:23)
although enforcement has been patchy (74:21 - 74:24)
while the Netherlands government (74:23 - 74:27)
continues to pursue loot box bands and (74:24 - 74:30)
close a loophole that let EA off the (74:27 - 74:32)
hook in (74:30 - 74:32)
2022 uh Pokemon unite which features a (74:32 - 74:37)
loot box style mechanic knows known as (74:35 - 74:40)
the prize machine wouldn&#39;t be the only (74:37 - 74:42)
game to say goodbye in Belgium&#39;s and (74:40 - 74:44)
Netherlands uh Activision Blizzard (74:42 - 74:46)
scrapped Diablo Immortals launch as a (74:44 - 74:49)
result to the current operation (74:46 - 74:51)
operating environment for those games uh (74:49 - 74:54)
as well as the original OverWatch which (74:51 - 74:58)
had their loot box removed her the (74:54 - 74:59)
Restriction uh there&#39;s some more there (74:58 - 75:01)
if you want to read the article it is in (74:59 - 75:03)
the show notes uh (75:01 - 75:06)
but yes when TCG pocket launches for (75:03 - 75:09)
everyone at the end of this month it (75:06 - 75:11)
will not be launching in the Netherlands (75:09 - 75:14)
or Belgium because (75:11 - 75:17)
of technically (75:14 - 75:17)
gambling that&#39;s unfortunate I guess uh I (75:18 - 75:27)
mean I I don&#39;t see either side of the (75:23 - 75:29)
they like they&#39;re not going to change (75:27 - 75:32)
their game to work for Netherlands and (75:29 - 75:34)
Belgium I&#39;m guessing and I don&#39;t see (75:32 - 75:36)
those governments backing down on what (75:34 - 75:38)
they&#39;re trying to do so yeah I mean I&#39;m (75:36 - 75:40)
not going to argue that loot boxes are a (75:38 - 75:42)
good (75:40 - 75:42)
thing that&#39;s the tricky thing (75:43 - 75:48)
here I you know I don&#39;t think they&#39;re (75:45 - 75:49)
going to change their game since they (75:48 - 75:51)
already said we&#39;d like to thank our (75:49 - 75:54)
players for their support yeah yeah no (75:51 - 75:57)
yeah definitely not not going to have (75:54 - 75:59)
these games available in those countries (75:57 - 76:01)
well right like their option is to (75:59 - 76:04)
modify it for those countries but it (76:01 - 76:07)
sounds like that&#39;s not worth it yeah I (76:04 - 76:09)
mean that&#39;s the thing is how much money (76:07 - 76:11)
are they getting from those right how (76:09 - 76:12)
much money are they bringing in from (76:11 - 76:14)
those countries if they were bringing (76:12 - 76:16)
enough they in they (76:14 - 76:19)
would probably change their game in some (76:16 - 76:23)
way uh I know that there are also you (76:19 - 76:25)
know we&#39;ve seen this with (76:23 - 76:28)
other companies and I mean I&#39;m (76:25 - 76:30)
specifically here I&#39;m talking like apple (76:28 - 76:33)
against the EU we&#39;ve seen it where you (76:30 - 76:35)
know you one company tries to say we&#39;re (76:33 - 76:38)
just going to say no and hope that the (76:35 - 76:40)
people in your country are mad enough at (76:38 - 76:42)
the government to get you to change your (76:40 - 76:47)
laws that doesn&#39;t typically work so but (76:42 - 76:49)
it does kind of sound like that&#39;s what (76:47 - 76:50)
they&#39;re doing here with like these games (76:49 - 76:53)
they&#39;re like well okay we&#39;re out bye and (76:50 - 76:55)
if the people in your country are mad (76:53 - 76:57)
enough about that maybe those laws will (76:55 - 76:59)
change I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to I (76:57 - 77:02)
think this is just what it is and these (76:59 - 77:03)
games aren&#39;t going to be available going (77:02 - 77:06)
forward and that&#39;s a bummer (77:03 - 77:12)
but yeah I can&#39;t say I love loot boxes (77:06 - 77:15)
you know but they do exist yeah I I did (77:12 - 77:16)
see some (77:15 - 77:18)
people (77:16 - 77:20)
uh small amount of people I guess (77:18 - 77:23)
because the Netherlands is is not that (77:20 - 77:25)
big compared to (77:23 - 77:29)
America or other countries (77:25 - 77:32)
but I I saw them like tweet at Joe S be (77:29 - 77:34)
of like can you explain why pocket isn&#39;t (77:32 - 77:36)
going to be available in the Netherlands (77:34 - 77:38)
and it&#39;s like are you asking this (77:36 - 77:40)
because you live in the Netherlands (77:38 - 77:41)
because if you live in the Netherlands (77:40 - 77:44)
you should maybe be aware of what your (77:41 - 77:47)
country necessarily laws (77:44 - 77:51)
are all the United States laws yes I do (77:47 - 77:52)
I read them every night before I go to (77:51 - 77:55)
bed sweet landom um (77:52 - 77:58)
but it&#39;s not like this is a new law and (77:55 - 78:00)
I I felt like everyone heard about the (77:58 - 78:02)
EA stuff with the loot the loot boxes (78:00 - 78:04)
like I thought that was pretty big in (78:02 - 78:06)
gaming news when that happened two years (78:04 - 78:09)
ago um even if it was big in gaming news (78:06 - 78:12)
I think people start to hear government (78:09 - 78:15)
like or laws or politics in any way and (78:12 - 78:17)
they just kind of shut it off in a lot (78:15 - 78:21)
of ways so yeah may I guess it&#39;s like (78:17 - 78:24)
it&#39;s the Pokemon company or any video (78:21 - 78:27)
game company would want to be everywhere (78:24 - 78:29)
if possible right cuz that&#39;s the most (78:27 - 78:34)
amount of money mhm um (78:29 - 78:34)
but to have your game in how x amount of (78:35 - 78:40)
countries but you need to change it for (78:39 - 78:43)
one specific country and again I&#39;m not (78:40 - 78:44)
picking on the Netherlands they&#39;re just (78:43 - 78:46)
not a very they&#39;re just not a huge (78:44 - 78:48)
country right they&#39;re compared to other (78:46 - 78:50)
countries few countries they&#39;re going to (78:48 - 78:52)
do that for one obviously China right (78:50 - 78:54)
like everybody changes their stuff for (78:52 - 78:56)
China yes because of how much money (78:54 - 78:58)
they&#39;re going to get being there that&#39;s (78:56 - 79:01)
just not that you&#39;re not going to have (78:58 - 79:04)
that same uh thing happening in most (79:01 - 79:08)
countries so um but yeah this is not (79:04 - 79:11)
this is not a problem that is like with (79:08 - 79:15)
Pokemon games it is a problem with any (79:11 - 79:19)
game with a loot box yeah kind of a (79:15 - 79:21)
problem with the gaming (79:19 - 79:24)
industry but yeah not one I see changing (79:21 - 79:26)
any anytime (79:24 - 79:28)
soon you there&#39;s probably an argument of (79:26 - 79:31)
like this is the correct thing to (79:28 - 79:34)
do for like Netherlands to be like we (79:31 - 79:37)
don&#39;t want games with loot boxes in our (79:34 - 79:40)
country because we find that they hurt (79:37 - 79:42)
more than they help or they&#39;re not fun (79:40 - 79:47)
or they&#39;re predatory 100% agree (79:42 - 79:47)
like I I think the only way this (79:48 - 79:52)
ultimately gets changed is if that (79:50 - 79:53)
spreads (79:52 - 79:58)
to more countries right or like all of (79:53 - 80:01)
Europe right yeah and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s (79:58 - 80:04)
I I don&#39;t know for sure this is not my (80:01 - 80:07)
uh area of expertise but I don&#39;t think (80:04 - 80:09)
it&#39;s priority for most (80:07 - 80:11)
places right doesn&#39;t even sound like it (80:09 - 80:13)
was much of a priority even though they (80:11 - 80:15)
had these laws in place they like they (80:13 - 80:17)
said they were like patchy at like (80:15 - 80:20)
actually doing anything well that&#39;s not (80:17 - 80:22)
abnormal that&#39;s that&#39;s actually kind of (80:20 - 80:26)
normal right so (80:22 - 80:29)
um yeah I don&#39;t know do either of you (80:26 - 80:31)
know what like the gambling laws are in (80:29 - 80:33)
those countries are they are there is (80:31 - 80:35)
there no gambling in Netherlands or (80:33 - 80:39)
Belgium it&#39;s on my reading list (80:35 - 80:42)
tonight because it sounds like they&#39;re (80:39 - 80:44)
likening this toward that and so I&#39;m (80:42 - 80:46)
just I&#39;m curious as to what the the (80:44 - 80:48)
gambling laws in those countries (80:46 - 80:53)
are yeah I I don&#39;t know uh the the fact (80:48 - 80:56)
that (80:53 - 80:56)
um blizzard which is a also a very big (80:56 - 81:04)
gaming company like just like (81:00 - 81:09)
pulled Diablo M uh Immortals (81:04 - 81:12)
which you make fun of Diablo Immortals (81:09 - 81:14)
all you want but that g that game makes (81:12 - 81:17)
a lot of money regardless of right if (81:14 - 81:20)
you think it&#39;s bad or not um the fact (81:17 - 81:22)
that they didn&#39;t even care to like (81:20 - 81:23)
change their game and they were just (81:22 - 81:25)
like we&#39;re just going to pull it it was (81:23 - 81:28)
I think just a sign of like this Market (81:25 - 81:31)
is not big enough for us to Care well (81:28 - 81:33)
and the fact I mean the thing is is that (81:31 - 81:35)
they make all this money off of their (81:33 - 81:38)
loot boxes yeah so if they change the (81:35 - 81:40)
game to not have the loot (81:38 - 81:42)
boxes what does that even do for them (81:40 - 81:44)
anyway yeah that money&#39;s coming from (81:42 - 81:46)
there I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s like a (81:44 - 81:50)
worry of like if we make it I I don&#39;t (81:46 - 81:52)
know somebody maybe can answer that in (81:50 - 81:54)
the YouTube comments or in slack or (81:52 - 81:56)
Discord who&#39;s maybe smarter than I am I (81:54 - 81:58)
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s if you change your (81:56 - 82:00)
game for one country like we&#39;re going to (81:58 - 82:03)
release pocket but we&#39;re going to remove (82:00 - 82:04)
the loot like I don&#39;t know what you (82:03 - 82:08)
would do there but like remove the loot (82:04 - 82:09)
boxes or change the game where there are (82:08 - 82:13)
no loot boxes do people then just like (82:09 - 82:15)
VPN into the Netherlands because they (82:13 - 82:17)
want that version of the game and then (82:15 - 82:20)
that becomes a (82:17 - 82:20)
problem I think it would be more if game (82:21 - 82:28)
companies start to make a new version (82:26 - 82:29)
that works for that country where (82:28 - 82:31)
there&#39;s no loot boxes or where there&#39;s (82:29 - 82:34)
not where it&#39;s changed then do other (82:31 - 82:37)
countries start saying whoa you can do (82:34 - 82:40)
that like let&#39;s start tightening laws to (82:37 - 82:41)
you know if other countries aren&#39;t on (82:40 - 82:43)
board with that as much either maybe (82:41 - 82:45)
like other countries pop in and start (82:43 - 82:46)
asking like well then that version (82:45 - 82:49)
should be here too I don&#39;t know like is (82:46 - 82:50)
it one of those you build it and all of (82:49 - 82:53)
a sudden other countries start saying oh (82:50 - 82:55)
then we want that on our in our country (82:53 - 82:56)
as (82:55 - 82:58)
well yeah I mean that from the developer (82:56 - 83:00)
standpoint it would be annoying to be (82:58 - 83:02)
like we need to bug test and feature (83:00 - 83:04)
test for two different versions of the (83:02 - 83:07)
game and make sure like this works and (83:04 - 83:09)
when there&#39;s competitive aspect that (83:07 - 83:12)
complicates everything yeah but and (83:09 - 83:13)
again they&#39;re making their money from (83:12 - 83:15)
the loot boxes so if they change the (83:13 - 83:17)
game to remove (83:15 - 83:20)
that what is the point from a business (83:17 - 83:22)
from their business standpoint they want (83:20 - 83:26)
to make the money so yeah I don&#39;t know (83:22 - 83:28)
if we can spend another hour talking (83:26 - 83:31)
about Niantic but I know the question is (83:28 - 83:33)
going to be well why is Pokemon go (83:31 - 83:37)
allowed right but their loophole whether (83:33 - 83:39)
you like it or not is very (83:37 - 83:42)
clever which is you&#39;re not technically (83:39 - 83:45)
buying loot boxes you&#39;re buying an (83:42 - 83:46)
you&#39;re buying an (83:45 - 83:50)
item to unlock unot boxes which is (83:46 - 83:55)
already predetermined when you get it (83:50 - 83:59)
yeah or you&#39;re unlocking the ability to (83:55 - 84:01)
battle 47 zash in and you don&#39;t you (83:59 - 84:03)
don&#39;t have to pay anything technically (84:01 - 84:06)
yeah because you get you get the free (84:03 - 84:08)
thing that you can just if you got you (84:06 - 84:11)
got nine eggs you can technically open (84:08 - 84:15)
all of those for free yep yep yep that&#39;s (84:11 - 84:17)
true you just got to walk a lot got to (84:15 - 84:19)
walk a lot and they&#39;ll all end up (84:17 - 84:21)
getting transferred for candy (84:19 - 84:25)
anyway so yeah (84:21 - 84:28)
the there could probably be a situation (84:25 - 84:31)
where the Netherlands would look at that (84:28 - 84:36)
and be like no this is a loot box (84:31 - 84:36)
but I mean I&#39;m skimming their laws right (84:36 - 84:42)
now and I think that Pokemon go has a (84:40 - 84:44)
pretty solid loophole as far as I can (84:42 - 84:49)
tell but yeah yeah I mean they they (84:44 - 84:50)
really do I mean when you look at what (84:49 - 84:52)
you&#39;re buying from Pokémon go you aren&#39;t (84:50 - 84:54)
buying a loot box like as much as you (84:52 - 84:55)
can say what you want but you&#39;re buying (84:54 - 84:59)
an item to speed up time right that&#39;s (84:55 - 85:01)
all you&#39;re doing when you&#39;re buying like (84:59 - 85:02)
and you&#39;re buying an incubator you&#39;re (85:01 - 85:05)
just you&#39;re just speeding up what will (85:02 - 85:08)
all already come from something for free (85:05 - 85:11)
which is different than actually buying (85:08 - 85:13)
the loot box (85:11 - 85:19)
MH it&#39;s not any better but it&#39;s (85:13 - 85:19)
different yeah I like I&#39;m I&#39;m like (85:20 - 85:25)
thinking like what if you could throw (85:22 - 85:27)
away eggs and get more eggs but like in (85:25 - 85:29)
what I was thinking of that too but I (85:27 - 85:30)
don&#39;t think that changes it enough (85:29 - 85:31)
you&#39;re still not no I don&#39;t think that (85:30 - 85:33)
changes it enough either cuz like who (85:31 - 85:35)
who is buying like 10 loot boxes and (85:33 - 85:37)
being like I&#39;m going to throw away these (85:35 - 85:41)
nine MH so the game gives me more like (85:37 - 85:43)
it&#39;s it&#39;s such an interesting loophole (85:41 - 85:45)
to think (85:43 - 85:45)
about I don&#39;t think what when when they (85:48 - 85:52)
designed it I don&#39;t think that was ever (85:50 - 85:55)
the intention either like I don&#39;t (85:52 - 85:56)
honestly I don&#39;t (85:55 - 86:00)
know probably (85:56 - 86:00)
not but I don&#39;t know it&#39;s definitely (86:01 - 86:06)

one hat one set of card sleeves four (87:39 - 87:45)
booster (87:43 - 87:45)
packs that&#39;s it uh that&#39;s that&#39;s what it (87:45 - 87:52)
will (87:50 - 87:52)
contain uh (87:52 - 87:56)
and then they have pictures of what (87:56 - 88:00)
could possibly be in it and if you look (87:57 - 88:00)
at the (88:00 - 88:02)
[Music] (88:00 - 88:05)
pictures also they have pictures of hats (88:02 - 88:06)
but they didn&#39;t say in the thing oh it (88:05 - 88:09)
does say say hat hat you get a hat yeah (88:06 - 88:10)
if you if you look at the pictures (88:09 - 88:11)
you&#39;re just (88:10 - 88:15)
like these are the things that are not (88:11 - 88:17)
selling that&#39;s what you&#39;re putting in (88:15 - 88:20)
the Box I mean that&#39;s what every mystery (88:17 - 88:23)
box is in the entire world not exclusive (88:20 - 88:26)
to Pokemon is like we have a bunch of (88:23 - 88:29)
product that we cannot physically (88:26 - 88:32)
sell if we say that you&#39;re getting a (88:29 - 88:34)
mystery box you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going (88:32 - 88:36)
to be in it we&#39;re just going to put the (88:34 - 88:38)
things that you didn&#39;t want to buy (88:36 - 88:41)
anyways into the box to be fair I don&#39;t (88:38 - 88:44)
have like a huge like from a business (88:41 - 88:47)
standpoint makes complete sense from a (88:44 - 88:50)
consumer standpoint I have never liked (88:47 - 88:53)
mystery boxes ever like you can go to (88:50 - 88:55)
like a a Comic-Con or C2 E2 and there (88:53 - 88:58)
are people that are selling mystery (88:55 - 88:58)
boxes for like 50 bucks but yeah yes I (88:58 - 89:07)
agree with you however I will say that (89:03 - 89:10)
the items in here if you buy them all (89:07 - 89:14)
separately I believe do add up to more (89:10 - 89:16)
than the value of the mystery box which (89:14 - 89:18)
when you typically buy a mystery box (89:16 - 89:20)
from one of those places that is not the (89:18 - 89:22)
case that&#39;s true yes the ones you&#39;re (89:20 - 89:24)
getting at ComicCon (89:22 - 89:27)
yeah or even um one thing I like in this (89:24 - 89:29)
too is especially because they do come (89:27 - 89:33)
with packs of cards is if you go into (89:29 - 89:36)
say like a a Walgreens uh or like a CVS (89:33 - 89:38)
they will have these mystery boxes that (89:36 - 89:41)
are packaged by third-party companies (89:38 - 89:43)
those are a scam too and they&#39;re way (89:41 - 89:45)
overpriced it&#39;ll be like $10 and you may (89:43 - 89:49)
get a Chase pack you end up with lately (89:45 - 89:50)
you end up with a pack of silver Tempest (89:49 - 89:53)
for $10 which is a $4 pack of cards you (89:50 - 89:54)
know like that&#39;s what it ends end up (89:53 - 89:58)
being so those are I think definitely (89:54 - 90:00)
scams this what you&#39;re getting at least (89:58 - 90:03)
adds up to the amount you&#39;re paying is (90:00 - 90:04)
more than the amount you&#39;re paying if (90:03 - 90:08)
you do like all of these things collect (90:04 - 90:10)
all of these things because a figure is (90:08 - 90:12)
the figure is probably like 15 plush is (90:10 - 90:14)
probably like 10 so right there you&#39;re (90:12 - 90:15)
at (90:14 - 90:20)
35 mhm pin set is like what 12 hat is I (90:15 - 90:23)
don&#39;t even know how much a hat is 20 (90:20 - 90:26)
maybe 25 prices you&#39;re saying are even (90:23 - 90:27)
lower than what they actually are I (90:26 - 90:29)
don&#39;t think a plush is 10 I don&#39;t think (90:27 - 90:31)
a figure is 15 I think they are more (90:29 - 90:33)
than that these days (90:31 - 90:36)
really I could be wrong you you two buy (90:33 - 90:39)
more things than I do off Pokemon the (90:36 - 90:41)
figures of like the skiddy the Meowth (90:39 - 90:44)
the the the FI the metti those were all (90:41 - 90:46)
pretty new figures and they were coming (90:44 - 90:48)
out once a (90:46 - 90:52)
month uh and I I don&#39;t think they sold (90:48 - 90:52)
at (90:52 - 90:55)
all like no I&#39;m looking at the Den one (90:52 - 90:57)
right now which just came out and it&#39;s (90:55 - 91:01)
15 okay um the Munchlax is 15 yeah all (90:57 - 91:03)
these figures are 15 okay yeah guess (91:01 - 91:06)
plushes plushes did hit the Pokemon (91:03 - 91:08)
inflation this year they did the plushes (91:06 - 91:10)
have gone up in price yeah I will say (91:08 - 91:12)
like even the sitting cuties when they (91:10 - 91:13)
first came out with this which these are (91:12 - 91:15)
not right these are not sitting cuties (91:13 - 91:17)
these are just like other plushes cuz (91:15 - 91:19)
they have could be sitting cuties but (91:17 - 91:23)
they have Pala in these uh yeah but the (91:19 - 91:25)
the ones below the p like that Charizard (91:23 - 91:27)
is the sitting cuing Char Charizard oh (91:25 - 91:30)
is it okay so they were like 10 when (91:27 - 91:31)
they initially came out but I will say I (91:30 - 91:33)
just bought a couple sitting cuties on (91:31 - 91:35)
on a re-release and they&#39;re like 18 a (91:33 - 91:39)
piece now yeah so yeah super expensive (91:35 - 91:41)
could be more like that&#39;s like 40 for (91:39 - 91:43)
two of those almost and then yeah so I (91:41 - 91:45)
think that the amount definitely is (91:43 - 91:46)
above the (91:45 - 91:50)
$50 um and I do think it&#39;s funny on the (91:46 - 91:52)
on the packs they do give you some (91:50 - 91:54)
different sets that it could be and then (91:52 - 91:57)
they throw in Sun and Moon which I&#39;m (91:54 - 91:58)
assuming that just means like sun and (91:57 - 92:01)
moon base set do people want sun and (91:58 - 92:03)
moon Bas set is that even sought after (92:01 - 92:06)
at this point I would say people do like (92:03 - 92:11)
getting packs from older eras so uh yeah (92:06 - 92:12)
I mean I think that would be sought (92:11 - 92:14)
after but you are it&#39;s four packs and (92:12 - 92:17)
there are six options here so you know (92:14 - 92:19)
you are getting and those are like five (92:17 - 92:21)
bucks a piece so that&#39;s like 20 there so (92:19 - 92:24)
I don&#39;t know I mean (92:21 - 92:26)
I think it&#39;s cool (92:24 - 92:31)
but I I think I (92:26 - 92:31)
think I think this is like a well like (92:32 - 92:37)
they they did it the best way they could (92:35 - 92:39)
MH (92:37 - 92:42)
with not like the when I see some of the (92:39 - 92:45)
boxes from Comic-Con and legitimately (92:42 - 92:46)
they&#39;re like 50 bucks they&#39;re like the (92:45 - 92:48)
little square Pokeball boxes and they do (92:46 - 92:50)
it for like Pokemon and Harry Potter and (92:48 - 92:53)
Marvel and gii Joe and Digimon right (92:50 - 92:55)
like you just see a wall of these and (92:53 - 92:59)
you&#39;ll see people who buy like four of (92:55 - 93:00)
them and they&#39;re walking around with (92:59 - 93:01)
four of them and you&#39;re just like (93:00 - 93:05)
there&#39;s no way what you&#39;re getting out (93:01 - 93:08)
of that is $50 worth and you&#39;ve did you (93:05 - 93:10)
did four of them right away you have to (93:08 - 93:13)
go to a few conventions to learn that (93:10 - 93:17)
though right sure when and those people (93:13 - 93:19)
people are getting taken advantage of (93:17 - 93:22)
but I I remember (93:19 - 93:25)
um this the earlier this year I don&#39;t (93:22 - 93:27)
remember which of it it was probably (93:25 - 93:32)
what whatever Comic-Con was not New York (93:27 - 93:35)
Comic-Con San Diego ComicCon whatever it (93:32 - 93:37)
was earlier this year maybe it wasn&#39;t (93:35 - 93:38)
Comic-Con itself but put on by the same (93:37 - 93:41)
company of Comic-Con okay what is that (93:38 - 93:45)
like readed pop or whatever um don&#39;t (93:41 - 93:49)
know yeah but but I found a Reddit post (93:45 - 93:50)
of somebody complaining about the (93:49 - 93:53)
Pokemon box and they they said it was (93:50 - 93:55)
supposed to be more than $50 worth of (93:53 - 93:56)
value and they opened it up and it was (93:55 - 93:58)
like one booster pack it was like some (93:56 - 94:03)
Pokemon suspenders it was like uh like a (93:58 - 94:04)
Pokemon (94:03 - 94:09)
mug um it was like B like Pokemon like (94:04 - 94:10)
very cheap balloons that you would like (94:09 - 94:13)
blow up and then like a like a luggage (94:10 - 94:16)
tag and they did the math and it wasn&#39;t (94:13 - 94:19)
$50 worth of stuff and then I went on (94:16 - 94:22)
Twitter and I found another person who (94:19 - 94:25)
had the same experience and (94:22 - 94:27)
they had almost identical things like (94:25 - 94:29)
instead of it being like a Snorlax mug (94:27 - 94:30)
it was like a Jigglypuff mug right it (94:29 - 94:34)
was like the same products but like not (94:30 - 94:37)
like but again not $50 and then I went (94:34 - 94:39)
on um it like blue sky or whatever the (94:37 - 94:41)
one time I used blue sky and again (94:39 - 94:42)
somebody else was complaining and the it (94:41 - 94:44)
was like like all the comments were like (94:42 - 94:45)
these are a scam I don&#39;t like why you (94:44 - 94:50)
bought in so two Pokemon&#39;s point two (94:45 - 94:54)
plushes uh a hat card sleeves (94:50 - 94:58)
it&#39;s more than $50 for sure totally and (94:54 - 95:00)
the box boxes this is far from the worst (94:58 - 95:04)
loot Box available this may be one of (95:00 - 95:05)
the better (95:04 - 95:09)
ones yeah and maybe maybe for like a kid (95:05 - 95:12)
who doesn&#39;t know what they want this (95:09 - 95:14)
would be like a great birthday present (95:12 - 95:16)
or like a great Christmas present I was (95:14 - 95:17)
going to say I love that they&#39;re (95:16 - 95:18)
marketing it is a present because I (95:17 - 95:20)
think that that&#39;s really what it&#39;s (95:18 - 95:23)
better as I think even even today I know (95:20 - 95:25)
what I would want from the Pokemon (95:23 - 95:27)
Center but if I were to get one of these (95:25 - 95:29)
boxes as a gift from someone who cares (95:27 - 95:33)
about me it&#39;s just Pokemon stuff it&#39;ll (95:29 - 95:35)
be fun to open even if it&#39;s not the (95:33 - 95:37)
things I would want the very most as a (95:35 - 95:39)
gift I think that that is great would I (95:37 - 95:42)
buy it for myself no if I bought it for (95:39 - 95:44)
myself would I be disappointed probably (95:42 - 95:48)
yes but I think as a gift it&#39;s great (95:44 - 95:50)
especially the cool box that turns (95:48 - 95:51)
inside out and then it just looks cool (95:50 - 95:53)
and you you don&#39;t have to do any (95:51 - 95:55)
wrapping or anything like (95:53 - 95:58)
that I think it&#39;s neat I do think it&#39;s (95:55 - 96:00)
unfortunate that box that turns inside (95:58 - 96:02)
out does not come with it it is the (96:00 - 96:06)
shipping box so if if it gets damaged or (96:02 - 96:09)
FedEx yeah it could you know and it does (96:06 - 96:11)
say that in there like the Box could get (96:09 - 96:13)
damaged and it is the it&#39;s the box (96:11 - 96:16)
everything comes in so sorry if it gets (96:13 - 96:18)
damaged also final sale items you can&#39;t (96:16 - 96:20)
anything right cuz like you&#39;re going to (96:18 - 96:23)
open it up and be like I got Charmeleon (96:20 - 96:25)
and Ivysaur I don&#39;t care about these two (96:23 - 96:27)
Pokemon and they&#39;re going be like I got (96:25 - 96:29)
a I got a metti (96:27 - 96:32)
figure no one likes (96:29 - 96:34)
metti (96:32 - 96:37)
ouch the one metatype fan out there is (96:34 - 96:39)
not happy with you right (96:37 - 96:42)
now yeah I like like I don&#39;t wear hats (96:39 - 96:44)
so like the the Hat being in the box is (96:42 - 96:49)
completely worthless to me right like uh (96:44 - 96:52)
I I I I have so many Pokemon card (96:49 - 96:54)
sleeves that are unopened and not use (96:52 - 96:56)
from Elite Trainer boxes that like a (96:54 - 96:58)
random (96:56 - 97:01)
65 pack of sleeves is not going to do (96:58 - 97:02)
anything to (97:01 - 97:06)
me I think I think they I think the (97:02 - 97:09)
Pokemon Center still comes out ahead (97:06 - 97:14)
here because they probably have so much (97:09 - 97:17)
merchandise that just didn&#39;t sell right (97:14 - 97:20)
like like who is buying this metti (97:17 - 97:22)
figure I know that there&#39;s like five (97:20 - 97:24)
people listening this podcast that like (97:22 - 97:26)
love metti they probably ordered this (97:24 - 97:28)
metti figure you&#39;re not allowed to (97:26 - 97:29)
complain unless you did specifically (97:28 - 97:31)
order this metti figure so I don&#39;t want (97:29 - 97:33)
to see your comments unless you yourself (97:31 - 97:34)
bought this meditite figure as a (97:33 - 97:37)
meditite fan but they probably have so (97:34 - 97:39)
many of these metti figures because it&#39;s (97:37 - 97:42)
just not as popular as a Charizard or a (97:39 - 97:46)
Pikachu or an Eevee right and I I think (97:42 - 97:49)
the Pokemon Center comes out ahead (97:46 - 97:52)
because keeping all of these unsold (97:49 - 97:55)
figures or plushes or pins on a shelf is (97:52 - 97:58)
costing them money mhm cuz they have to (97:55 - 97:59)
pay for storage they have to pay for (97:58 - 98:03)
that inventory so just I do think it&#39;s (97:59 - 98:04)
clever that they came up with a really (98:03 - 98:07)
cool box I think there is value there if (98:04 - 98:08)
you&#39;re a parent and you&#39;re like I don&#39;t (98:07 - 98:10)
know what to get my kids (98:08 - 98:12)
or (98:10 - 98:14)
you you have a friend that&#39;s really into (98:12 - 98:16)
Pokemon but they don&#39;t tell you what (98:14 - 98:17)
their favorite Pokemon is or they don&#39;t (98:16 - 98:18)
tell you exactly what they want so (98:17 - 98:21)
getting I I I understand why this is (98:18 - 98:24)
sold out yeah really just don&#39;t go to a (98:21 - 98:25)
convention and buy one of those third (98:24 - 98:27)
party Pokemon boxes is what I&#39;m telling (98:25 - 98:30)
you to do yeah yeah but people also like (98:27 - 98:34)
the mystery of these things yes so (98:30 - 98:37)
I like I don&#39;t care about the (98:34 - 98:39)
mystery I I could definitely see people (98:37 - 98:41)
buying this for themselves though I (98:39 - 98:42)
could see people buying this as a (98:41 - 98:44)
Pokemon fan just as someone who likes (98:42 - 98:48)
Pokemon stuff who I mean Steve the (98:44 - 98:49)
amount of stuff you&#39;ve bought from (98:48 - 98:52)
Pokemon Center but yeah I but I know (98:49 - 98:54)
exactly what I want right like sure (98:52 - 98:56)
every sitting cutie I want I bought (98:54 - 99:00)
every figure I wanted I bought like even (98:56 - 99:02)
looking at the like I like I like fany a (99:00 - 99:04)
lot I think fan is a cool Pokemon but (99:02 - 99:06)
like that figure like I know the quality (99:04 - 99:09)
I know the quality is not very good (99:06 - 99:11)
right yeah but I don&#39;t know I feel like (99:09 - 99:14)
there are people who like Pokemon maybe (99:11 - 99:15)
haven&#39;t thought like oh I want to buy (99:14 - 99:17)
like this specific plush or that (99:15 - 99:18)
specific plush but they look at the (99:17 - 99:19)
items here and they&#39;re like I like (99:18 - 99:22)
Pokemon I like the items on here like (99:19 - 99:24)
it&#39;s fun to get like a mystery and you (99:22 - 99:25)
don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re going to (99:24 - 99:27)
get and then they open it up and it&#39;s a (99:25 - 99:29)
surprise like I I totally see people (99:27 - 99:30)
wanting to buy this for themselves as (99:29 - 99:33)
well ially when this is one of the (99:30 - 99:36)
better value mystery boxes yeah I just (99:33 - 99:37)
don&#39;t think it&#39;s sold out on people that (99:36 - 99:39)
are like I&#39;m buying this for someone (99:37 - 99:41)
else because I know they like Pokemon (99:39 - 99:43)
but I don&#39;t know like exactly what they (99:41 - 99:45)
want like I think that is that&#39;s there (99:43 - 99:47)
but I don&#39;t think like that is why this (99:45 - 99:49)
sold out especially as quick as it sold (99:47 - 99:53)
out I think this is a majority of people (99:49 - 99:56)
probably did buy this for (99:53 - 99:56)
themselves (99:57 - 100:01)
maybe again just because of how quickly (99:59 - 100:03)
it sold out I really do think that they (100:01 - 100:05)
people or they&#39;re going to like I I do (100:03 - 100:07)
wonder if you will see these being (100:05 - 100:10)
resold well yes I think that might be an (100:07 - 100:12)
aspect of it I think that the box is an (100:10 - 100:14)
exclusive item that people are probably (100:12 - 100:16)
going to try to resell yeah I haven&#39;t (100:14 - 100:18)
checked eBay I also think that we are (100:16 - 100:20)
getting to the point in the year where a (100:18 - 100:22)
lot of people are looking for gifts (100:20 - 100:27)
starting to yeah I it would (100:22 - 100:31)
be it would be cool if like the special (100:27 - 100:34)
delivery Pikachu came in these boxes (100:31 - 100:37)
yeah but I that would also just lead to (100:34 - 100:40)
people the card yeah that card&#39;s worth (100:37 - 100:44)
like $150 right now yeah but Pokemon can (100:40 - 100:47)
always change more of them yeah exactly (100:44 - 100:50)
not if you overproduce them they&#39;re not (100:47 - 100:53)
uh I just think for how quickly it sold (100:50 - 100:55)
out people who are looking to buy things (100:53 - 100:57)
for other (100:55 - 100:59)
people I don&#39;t think they stumbled upon (100:57 - 101:01)
this and then were just like immediately (100:59 - 101:03)
buying it I really don&#39;t I really think (101:01 - 101:05)
that that this sold out because of (101:03 - 101:06)
people who are buying this for (101:05 - 101:09)
themselves or who are Pokemon fans like (101:06 - 101:10)
I don&#39;t think there was a bunch of (101:09 - 101:11)
people who were looking to buy things (101:10 - 101:12)
for someone that came on the site at the (101:11 - 101:15)
same time within a day and got this to (101:12 - 101:16)
sell out I think I think this is the (101:15 - 101:19)
same problem as conventions though that (101:16 - 101:23)
people see a loot box and they they just (101:19 - 101:26)
imp by it I&#39;m really curious to see what (101:23 - 101:28)
the reviews are going to be on this (101:26 - 101:30)
box yeah we can do a whole segment of (101:28 - 101:32)
reading reviews it doesn&#39;t ship until (101:30 - 101:36)
November but like even like when I&#39;m at (101:32 - 101:39)
a convention I am so curious of what&#39;s (101:36 - 101:41)
in that box and I know that&#39;s part of (101:39 - 101:43)
why people are buying it right they&#39;re (101:41 - 101:45)
like oh what could be in it like but I (101:43 - 101:48)
know that it&#39;s just junk I know that (101:45 - 101:50)
it&#39;s nothing that I would actually buy (101:48 - 101:54)
that&#39;s why it&#39;s in a mystery box mhm (101:50 - 101:58)
but like me I&#39;m I went out of my way to (101:54 - 102:00)
be like somebody on Twitter somebody on (101:58 - 102:02)
Reddit somebody on social media would (102:00 - 102:04)
definitely post what&#39;s inside the box (102:02 - 102:06)
right they&#39;re gonna and and then once (102:04 - 102:09)
you see what&#39;s in it you&#39;re like oh yeah (102:06 - 102:10)
it was exactly what I thought I saved (102:09 - 102:14)
money all right but like so this selling (102:10 - 102:16)
out is not surprising because I think (102:14 - 102:18)
there is an Impulse to be like oh my (102:16 - 102:20)
gosh I want to see what&#39;s in it and it&#39;s (102:18 - 102:22)
it&#39;s they they did clearly lay out (102:20 - 102:24)
what&#39;s in 10 items four of those are (102:22 - 102:26)
going be booster packs you don&#39;t usually (102:24 - 102:27)
get that with a mystery box yeah it (102:26 - 102:29)
literally shows what you&#39;re like (102:27 - 102:31)
possibly going to get like for each (102:29 - 102:34)
thing each section of it so yeah so like (102:31 - 102:35)
like to me what&#39;s going to be in it is (102:34 - 102:38)
two sitting cuties that sold terribly (102:35 - 102:41)
well that sold terribly so like Kakuna (102:38 - 102:43)
get somebody&#39;s going to get a caka who (102:41 - 102:45)
is out there buying Kakuna plushes no (102:43 - 102:47)
one that&#39;s not true I have seen people (102:45 - 102:51)
enjoin the Kakuna plus Pine like you&#39;re (102:47 - 102:53)
the items you&#39;re going I think it&#39;s the (102:51 - 102:55)
items they show on the image I not for (102:53 - 102:58)
all of them not for all of them I can&#39;t (102:55 - 102:59)
imagine items you may receive are shown (102:58 - 103:01)
in the image (102:59 - 103:03)
gallery yeah yeah I think they&#39;re (103:01 - 103:06)
showing like sitting cuties definitely (103:03 - 103:08)
and then the top part is um like the (103:06 - 103:10)
Galler stuff that probably or not the (103:08 - 103:12)
Galler the oh I definitely thought it (103:10 - 103:15)
was like the specific one the specific (103:12 - 103:17)
ones they&#39;re actually showing it&#39;s going (103:15 - 103:19)
to be one of those there are not going (103:17 - 103:21)
to be Charizard plushies in these boxes (103:19 - 103:22)
yeah there&#39;s the Charizard plushies and (103:21 - 103:25)
the Pikachu plus are very much in stock (103:22 - 103:28)
right now um for these things like right (103:25 - 103:30)
currently yeah I&#39;m I&#39;m sure one person (103:28 - 103:31)
will get a Charizard maybe they made way (103:30 - 103:34)
too many Charizards but you but like do (103:31 - 103:35)
you think they&#39;re sitting on too many (103:34 - 103:36)
Charizards or do you think they&#39;re (103:35 - 103:39)
sitting on too many quill (103:36 - 103:42)
fishes oh okay I&#39;m okay now now I&#39;m (103:39 - 103:43)
actually more interested I definitely (103:42 - 103:45)
thought it was the specific ones that (103:43 - 103:47)
are in these images are what you&#39;re (103:45 - 103:49)
going to get one of the two worst (103:47 - 103:52)
Pokemon I could possibly get in plush (103:49 - 103:56)
form please thank you here is (103:52 - 103:59)
$50 you okay so the figures that are the (103:56 - 104:01)
seven figures you don&#39;t think are like (103:59 - 104:02)
are somebody&#39;s going to get those but (104:01 - 104:04)
you think there are other figures that (104:02 - 104:05)
people might get that are not there was (104:04 - 104:09)
there was 12 of them and they also they (104:05 - 104:14)
they all like if you think about the um (104:09 - 104:16)
the Year of the Dragon pins mhm they (104:14 - 104:19)
sell out instantly yes they do these (104:16 - 104:22)
figures never none of them ever sold out (104:19 - 104:24)
and there was one every month (104:22 - 104:25)
they even they even hyped it up in the (104:24 - 104:27)
newsletter of like I remember them all (104:25 - 104:29)
being silhouettes of like oh what are (104:27 - 104:31)
these like I I&#39;m I think there&#39;s a Mimi (104:29 - 104:33)
Q one that just came out or is coming (104:31 - 104:34)
out and maybe that one will sell better (104:33 - 104:36)
than like the Meowth of the (104:34 - 104:37)
beon (104:36 - 104:41)
um I still okay I read the items you may (104:37 - 104:43)
receive are shown in the image gallery (104:41 - 104:45)
meant like the items you may receive are (104:43 - 104:48)
the ones you see in the image gallery (104:45 - 104:49)
because they explain what you&#39;re going (104:48 - 104:52)
to get right above that and then in bold (104:49 - 104:54)
they say items you make may receive are (104:52 - 104:56)
shown in the image (104:54 - 104:59)
gallery I think word may there the items (104:56 - 105:03)

QD choices are Eevee Charizard Pikachu (105:05 - 105:11)
Bulbasaur Charmeleon Slowpoke Charmander (105:08 - 105:15)

some somebody somebody&#39;s getting a (105:15 - 105:18)
Metapod no one actually my daughter got (105:19 - 105:24)

GNA Jinx sitting (105:31 - 105:36)
cutie I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think so we&#39;ll see (105:33 - 105:39)
we&#39;ll see in November I guess uh also (105:36 - 105:42)
like like I can&#39;t imagine that the (105:39 - 105:46)
starter Pokemon Fuoco quackley spatio I (105:42 - 105:49)
can&#39;t imagine that those sold (105:46 - 105:51)
poorly (105:49 - 105:54)
like I there there are some really bad (105:51 - 105:57)
three packs of pins that they must be (105:54 - 105:58)
sitting on like I&#39;m sure some people (105:57 - 106:00)
will get like a spatio three pack right (105:58 - 106:03)
like but some people have to right they (106:00 - 106:05)
can&#39;t they&#39;re not going to Showcase (106:03 - 106:07)
these and then not give anybody them (106:05 - 106:08)
yeah but (106:07 - 106:12)
like like there&#39;s no there&#39;s no Universe (106:08 - 106:15)
where spatio three pack is not (106:12 - 106:17)
outselling the nitan male three pack (106:15 - 106:19)
like I&#39;m sure there&#39;s somebody out there (106:17 - 106:21)
that loves Neato Queen loves Neo King (106:19 - 106:24)
and loves Neo ran but there are way more (106:21 - 106:25)
people out there loving spr atito they (106:24 - 106:27)
have to be sitting on so (106:25 - 106:31)
many Neato (106:27 - 106:31)
Kings also a three pack of pins is now (106:33 - 106:38)
up to $18.99 those used to be (106:35 - 106:43)
$12.99 yep those used to be (106:38 - 106:43)
12.99 I just I just don&#39;t think Roy Coy (106:44 - 106:49)
carcoal and colossal are selling that (106:47 - 106:53)
well I just they&#39;re going to the (106:49 - 106:53)
the whole point of this is to get rid of (106:55 - 107:00)
your inventory yeah exactly but are (106:57 - 107:01)
these I (107:00 - 107:08)
mean yeah except except it does say that (107:01 - 107:11)
um each special delivery box comes with (107:08 - 107:15)
10 items currently or recently available (107:11 - 107:18)
for purchase online which would make (107:15 - 107:20)
mean that those items aren&#39;t available (107:18 - 107:22)
to purchase now recently available (107:20 - 107:24)
currently or (107:22 - 107:26)
so that&#39;s interesting because if they (107:24 - 107:28)
were trying to get rid of product why (107:26 - 107:29)
would they have stuff that isn&#39;t (107:28 - 107:32)
available to buy currently as things (107:29 - 107:35)
going into these mystery (107:32 - 107:35)
boxes they were recently they could just (107:35 - 107:40)
have like a bunch of like old like hats (107:38 - 107:42)
or sleeves that they&#39;re just trying to (107:40 - 107:44)
get rid of yeah that&#39;s true like I (107:42 - 107:46)
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of the (107:44 - 107:47)
sleeves that people are getting are the (107:46 - 107:49)
van go sleeves like the van Go stuff (107:47 - 107:51)
went back up on Pokemon Center yeah and (107:49 - 107:53)
it&#39;s like it&#39;s the plush and it&#39;s like (107:51 - 107:56)
every variation of the card sleeves yeah (107:53 - 107:59)
still know murgle mugs (107:56 - 108:02)
sad still sold out of those (107:59 - 108:05)
mugs I don&#39;t know I I&#39;m now interested (108:02 - 108:08)
in what people I didn&#39;t buy one I had no (108:05 - 108:10)
I didn&#39;t buy one either but I you know (108:08 - 108:11)
there that there&#39;s some YouTuber out (108:10 - 108:13)
there that bought like 10 of them oh it (108:11 - 108:15)
says purchase limit one uh they probably (108:13 - 108:16)
made 10 accounts but like I&#39;m sure (108:15 - 108:17)
that&#39;s going to be a YouTube video of (108:16 - 108:21)
like I opened 10 special delivery boxes (108:17 - 108:22)
I guess that does stop people from (108:21 - 108:24)
reselling them if it was only a purchase (108:22 - 108:26)
liit of one when you get resell one of (108:24 - 108:28)
them I guess you could there&#39;s probably (108:26 - 108:31)
if if you were like a boy this is a real (108:28 - 108:34)
business episode if you were a vendor at (108:31 - 108:35)
like a (108:34 - 108:38)
convention uh at like a I don&#39;t know (108:35 - 108:41)
like a Nationals or something or (108:38 - 108:43)
regionals regionals is probably a better (108:41 - 108:44)
example because I think they allow third (108:43 - 108:47)
party vendors I could see a (108:44 - 108:50)
vendor pay $50 for this and then they (108:47 - 108:52)
can sell the plush for $15 they got two (108:50 - 108:54)
plushes they can sell that&#39;s $30 they (108:52 - 108:56)
can sell the hat for $15 they&#39;re up to (108:54 - 108:59)
$45 they can sell all the booster (108:56 - 109:03)
packs separately right like if you if (108:59 - 109:05)
you were a reseller you make your money (109:03 - 109:08)
back here assuming as long as you sell (109:05 - 109:10)
as long as you as as long as you sell (109:08 - 109:12)
but like value (109:10 - 109:16)
wise there is more than $50 worth of (109:12 - 109:18)
stuff here (109:16 - 109:21)
MH (109:18 - 109:21)
y I don&#39;t know if you if you got (109:22 - 109:27)
one and you&#39;re watching or listening to (109:25 - 109:29)
this podcast a month (109:27 - 109:32)
later tell me what you got in the (109:29 - 109:35)
comments I would like to know we got to (109:32 - 109:37)

Kakuna somebody out there&#39;s getting a (109:37 - 109:40)
Kakuna (109:38 - 109:42)
100% Kakuna and like bell sprout no (109:40 - 109:45)

getting kaga no no they&#39;re not I don&#39;t (109:49 - 109:54)
think so I really don&#39;t think so there&#39;s (109:52 - 109:57)
no way they produced an there&#39;s no way (109:54 - 109:59)
they sold a Kakuna plushes I&#39;m not (109:57 - 110:00)
saying they did I just don&#39;t think (109:59 - 110:02)
anybody sneak a (110:00 - 110:06)
Kaka why would they keep those in stock (110:02 - 110:08)
yeah they&#39;re still in stock like on the (110:06 - 110:10)
back end they&#39;re going to be like still (110:08 - 110:12)
in stock we saw yeah cuz they probably (110:10 - 110:15)
because they they probably Pikachu has (110:12 - 110:17)
more plushes than like all (110:15 - 110:19)
135 other Pokemon (110:17 - 110:21)
