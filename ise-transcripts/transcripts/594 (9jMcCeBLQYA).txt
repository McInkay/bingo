DLC which is in less than two weeks (0:51 - 0:59)
which is wild it sounded so convincing I (0:54 - 1:02)
I'm I'm trying to wa weigh I am excited (0:59 - 1:05)
for the DLC that is genuine I just I'm (1:02 - 1:07)
trying to weigh how much I (1:05 - 1:09)
disappointment I want to convey about (1:07 - 1:12)
Pokemon go but we'll get to that oh you (1:09 - 1:14)
didn't know we got we got a lot that's (1:12 - 1:16)
we save your emotions for that section (1:14 - 1:18)

Pokemon go this week but we also have (1:18 - 1:23)
Greg this week yeah I'm here my tree is (1:20 - 1:28)
up I have my 1999 Pokemon ornaments up (1:23 - 1:31)

so pretty and (1:41 - 1:45)
[Music] (1:43 - 1:49)
fancy uh all right well uh we have a (1:45 - 1:51)
show for y'all today uh we have a lot of (1:49 - 1:53)
Pokemon go which is kind (1:51 - 1:56)
of different because for a long time we (1:53 - 1:57)
haven't really been talking that much (1:56 - 1:59)
about go usually like an update here or (1:57 - 2:01)
there but not like huge segments but we (1:59 - 2:03)
do have a lot this this time which is (2:01 - 2:05)
weird because like this is like not (2:03 - 2:06)
their busy season but I think they're (2:05 - 2:09)
trying to like fix that it's not weird (2:06 - 2:10)
they just dropped all the news for a (2:09 - 2:14)
full season yeah they do this once two (2:10 - 2:16)
twice three times a year three times a (2:14 - 2:20)
year four four hang on four can I get a (2:16 - 2:22)
five five five five any get a five can I (2:20 - 2:26)
get a five uh unite also dropped a big (2:22 - 2:31)
update as well we'll get to um and we're (2:26 - 2:32)
going to start off with Pokemon sleep (2:31 - 2:33)
which I didn't think we'd have anything (2:32 - 2:37)
to talk about sleep but a small update (2:33 - 2:44)
here uh it won Google plays best of (2:37 - 2:48)
2023 which Google has their own I don't (2:44 - 2:50)
know the other things because I don't (2:48 - 2:53)
have a Android phone so I don't know (2:50 - 2:54)
what apps over there are getting (2:53 - 2:58)
nominated for Stuff uh Apple does this (2:54 - 3:01)
every year and if you're nominated by (2:58 - 3:03)
Apple for something usually you're (3:01 - 3:05)
you're like now set up for Success cuz (3:03 - 3:08)
like apple has now put you in front of (3:05 - 3:11)
millions of people very easily and Apple (3:08 - 3:14)
has given you their their their Kiss of (3:11 - 3:16)
Life or (3:14 - 3:18)
whatever and now You' have been blessed (3:16 - 3:21)
by the Apple Gods uh Apple did not bless (3:18 - 3:25)
Pokemon sleep they did not good on them (3:21 - 3:28)
I believe their competition was hanai (3:25 - 3:31)
star rail oh yes yeah (3:28 - 3:35)
yeah uh but Google has uh has blessed (3:31 - 3:38)
Pokemon sleep here uh and it says thank (3:35 - 3:41)
you for playing Pokemon sleep uh Pokemon (3:38 - 3:42)
sleep has received Awards in the (3:41 - 3:44)
following three categories for Google (3:42 - 3:49)
plays best which is users choice in (3:44 - 3:54)
Japan um I don't think Apple Country (3:49 - 3:58)
fies their winners I don't think so I (3:54 - 4:01)
think it's a worldwide thing thing uh (3:58 - 4:04)
cute and Casual category in Japan take (4:01 - 4:08)
that hanai star rail well that's not (4:04 - 4:12)
casual that's a lifestyle best game for (4:08 - 4:14)
good which was the (4:12 - 4:16)
US and they said thank you for your (4:14 - 4:19)
support as a gesture of our gratitude (4:16 - 4:22)
you will get one main skill seed uh (4:19 - 4:24)
1,000 sleep points and five Pokey (4:22 - 4:28)
biscuits as a thank you (4:24 - 4:31)
for so I'm the you you know I am shocked (4:28 - 4:33)
as somebody who enjoys Pokemon sleep I (4:31 - 4:36)
know I'm like maybe in a niche audience (4:33 - 4:39)
there but it does seem like the people (4:36 - 4:41)
who have stuck with it more than a month (4:39 - 4:45)
or so have definitely stuck with (4:41 - 4:49)
it I think so too I am seeing people who (4:45 - 4:51)
have definitely dropped Pokemon go over (4:49 - 4:53)
the years who have continued playing (4:51 - 4:55)
Pokemon sleep so it is at least keeping (4:53 - 4:58)
some people who are maybe slightly more (4:55 - 5:03)
casual Pokemon players even though it's (4:58 - 5:05)
I mean it it can be a casual game or it (5:03 - 5:07)
can be an intense game Greg is the (5:05 - 5:09)
definition of casual when it comes to (5:07 - 5:11)
sleep oh heck (5:09 - 5:14)
yeah I hit a button and I hit a button (5:11 - 5:17)
and then I look at it and go (5:14 - 5:20)
cool think you pick ingredients for me I (5:17 - 5:21)
don't (5:20 - 5:24)
care the the fan does nothing I'm (5:21 - 5:27)
hitting the screen tapy tap (5:24 - 5:29)
goodbye I think Hannah makes a good (5:27 - 5:32)
point where with Pokemon go you've seen (5:29 - 5:34)
people drop off but I think part of that (5:32 - 5:39)
is Pokemon go has so many things going (5:34 - 5:41)
on that even if you step away from (5:39 - 5:43)
Pokemon go for like six months and you (5:41 - 5:46)
come back you're just like I where do I (5:43 - 5:48)
begin how do I they just keep adding (5:46 - 5:50)
more (5:48 - 5:53)
stuff but in Pokemon sleep yeah Greg you (5:50 - 5:55)
are playing the absolute minimum and I (5:53 - 5:57)
spent maybe three hours on Monday coming (5:55 - 5:59)
up with the best team I could for the (5:57 - 6:00)
week so it's (5:59 - 6:03)
you can definitely be very casual or you (6:00 - 6:06)
can be very not casual I'm I'm I'm (6:03 - 6:07)
running almost every Pokemon through a (6:06 - 6:09)
sleep (6:07 - 6:11)
calculator see I still I still don't (6:09 - 6:13)
believe in that calculator I know oh I (6:11 - 6:17)
do I I believe I believe in the (6:13 - 6:20)
calculator I (6:17 - 6:20)
cannot I cannot bring myself to Care on (6:20 - 6:26)
a game that (6:24 - 6:29)
resets every week but your Pokemon don't (6:26 - 6:31)
reset (6:29 - 6:33)
with me doing basically for no good (6:31 - 6:35)
reason other than it (6:33 - 6:38)
resets and then I feel like okay and (6:35 - 6:41)
then again this I don't particularly (6:38 - 6:43)
also enjoy the cycle of oh if I catch (6:41 - 6:45)
this more I'll get a better one later so (6:43 - 6:46)
all the investment that I put in the (6:45 - 6:48)
first one is null and void because I got (6:46 - 6:50)
a better one that's more optimized later (6:48 - 6:53)
that's a garbage mechanic and I hate it (6:50 - 6:56)
uh so I can't possibly bring myself to (6:53 - 6:59)
care because there's so many annoying (6:56 - 7:02)
things to me personally about how they (6:59 - 7:05)
run that cycle that I cannot be bothered (7:02 - 7:07)
to care about a calculator like I got (7:05 - 7:09)
Eevees I'm like well I have 17 of them (7:07 - 7:10)
and technically one will be slightly (7:09 - 7:15)
better I don't care well that's I (7:10 - 7:20)
just already awkward evolve them (7:15 - 7:20)
into and then it's like oh but today (7:21 - 7:26)
snar Lex really likes these berries and (7:24 - 7:29)
this type of food for this week how (7:26 - 7:31)
could I picked that you couldn't it's (7:29 - 7:33)
just there is there way to influence (7:31 - 7:36)
probably I don't (7:33 - 7:36)
care I mean sounds like you don't like (7:36 - 7:42)
Rog legs I don't that's I mean that's (7:38 - 7:45)
all it is it's just a Rog (7:42 - 7:45)
leg I feel like not that (7:46 - 7:53)
I there there is like I I totally (7:49 - 7:57)
understand why people play um like (7:53 - 8:00)
randomizers not that I I I don't play (7:57 - 8:02)
randomizers right also like papa pikachu (8:00 - 8:03)
would get very mad at me that I would be (8:02 - 8:05)
downloading some illegal ROM and what (8:03 - 8:08)
whatever whatever whatever uh but there (8:05 - 8:10)
is that like (8:08 - 8:13)
Randomness that people find refreshing (8:10 - 8:16)
like I love this so much but I can go in (8:13 - 8:18)
every week and it's different and I I do (8:16 - 8:19)
think that's what appeals to me in (8:18 - 8:24)
Pokemon sleep is like if Snorlax didn't (8:19 - 8:26)
constantly change its berries or (8:24 - 8:28)
whatever then I would have no incentive (8:26 - 8:31)
to change my team or care about getting (8:28 - 8:34)
a Pokemon that would be use like right (8:31 - 8:36)
now Snorlax has never accepted whatever (8:34 - 8:39)
mime Junior's Barry is I don't (8:36 - 8:41)
remember but like there will be a day (8:39 - 8:43)
where like whatever that Barry mime Jr (8:41 - 8:46)
has that Snorlax will want that Berry (8:43 - 8:48)
eventually it will be (8:46 - 8:52)
useful whatever that Barry is um I like (8:48 - 8:54)
it but yeah if if you're not like a Rog (8:52 - 8:58)
likee person I understand (8:54 - 9:03)
uh switch over over here to Pokemon go (8:58 - 9:05)
we have a lot of Go News uh let's talk (9:03 - 9:07)
about (9:05 - 9:11)
the I guess let's talk about the season (9:07 - 9:16)
first um the uh season of Timeless (9:11 - 9:20)
travels that's what it (9:16 - 9:20)
is it's got a lot of Hui and it's got a (9:21 - 9:25)
lot of Kanto and you know what we're all (9:24 - 9:27)
real tired of right (9:25 - 9:32)
now Kanto and (9:27 - 9:32)
sinno um yeah I mean this makes sense in (9:32 - 9:38)
the regards of this season overlaps with (9:35 - 9:42)
the CNO tour which they (9:38 - 9:46)
announced um maybe would have been (9:42 - 9:49)
better served closer to Legends archus (9:46 - 9:53)
but you know here we are they had a (9:49 - 9:55)
season relatively well themed they did (9:53 - 9:57)
Steve and booked the the event for the (9:55 - 10:00)
wrong year yeah (9:57 - 10:02)
we're we're going to talk about c tour (10:00 - 10:05)
and how C is one of the most (10:02 - 10:10)
disappointing pokedexes ever uh uh in (10:05 - 10:13)
my in my eyes (10:10 - 10:17)
but um they they are doing huian samarat (10:13 - 10:20)
today as we're recording this which (10:17 - 10:23)
lines up with huian samarat in scarlet (10:20 - 10:25)
and violet so there is they they still (10:23 - 10:28)
do for the most part try to line their (10:25 - 10:31)
games up somewhat (10:28 - 10:33)
together I feel like this one was maybe (10:31 - 10:36)
more of an accident but (10:33 - 10:39)
sure somebody I don't I don't know (10:36 - 10:41)
Janine's pretty much on top of that (10:39 - 10:44)
calendar though so (10:41 - 10:46)
no (10:44 - 10:48)
um but here let's start let's start with (10:46 - 10:49)
the the (10:48 - 10:52)
features they they didn't update to (10:49 - 10:54)
Roots so let's start there because this (10:52 - 10:56)
is the first new character they've added (10:54 - 11:00)
to the game since re (10:56 - 11:03)
M (11:00 - 11:06)
uh uh Mato which is a researcher who (11:03 - 11:08)
loves to travel is on his way to Pokémon (11:06 - 11:10)
go he en his he enjoys collecting (11:08 - 11:12)
exchanging postcards and gifts from all (11:10 - 11:14)
over the world he's excited to meet you (11:12 - 11:17)
at the end of your journey on a route as (11:14 - 11:19)
you end near on a route Mato will be (11:17 - 11:21)
waiting for you with some gifts that (11:19 - 11:24)
he's collected talk to Mato to begin a (11:21 - 11:26)
gift exchange choose which of Matteo's (11:24 - 11:29)
gifts gifts to exchange from a root (11:26 - 11:32)
endpoint the root start point or a (11:29 - 11:36)
nearby Poké stop add a sticker to you to (11:32 - 11:38)
the gift if you would like um and then (11:36 - 11:41)
get ready to receive a new uh momento (11:38 - 11:43)
from another trainer don't forget to add (11:41 - 11:46)
the postcard to your post card book to (11:43 - 11:48)
expand your collection to get the forms (11:46 - 11:52)
of Vivan you can do this once a day with (11:48 - 11:55)
Mato (11:52 - 11:55)
um and that's kind of it (11:55 - 12:03)
yep that's kind of (12:00 - 12:06)
it it's it's another thing to do uh you (12:03 - 12:09)
can open your 20 gifts you can spin your (12:06 - 12:11)
stop you can catch your Pokemon you can (12:09 - 12:12)
get your free item from the store you (12:11 - 12:15)
can do your one lucky trade you can do (12:12 - 12:18)
your route you can visit Mato you can (12:15 - 12:20)
it's just like it's not a bad thing it's (12:18 - 12:22)
just another thing they're adding on to (12:20 - 12:24)
the tons of things you can do in Pokemon (12:22 - 12:27)
go yeah it's good for people who didn't (12:24 - 12:30)
add other trainers specific to complete (12:27 - 12:32)
the vivon decks because this is going to (12:30 - 12:36)
be one easier way to do that M but (12:32 - 12:38)
that's about (12:36 - 12:44)
it I maybe they'll do more stuff M Mato (12:38 - 12:46)
in the future I don't again I don't (12:44 - 12:49)
think it's bad um it probably definitely (12:46 - 12:51)
benefits people who are not in like a (12:49 - 12:55)
big city or people who don't live online (12:51 - 12:57)
or are in like a Discord group or a (12:55 - 12:59)
friend group where they can exchange GI (12:57 - 13:01)
gifts like I don't see really any (12:59 - 13:02)
negatives to it it's not like they're (13:01 - 13:05)
adding Mato but removing lucky friends (13:02 - 13:07)
like like there's really no negative (13:05 - 13:10)
here um the only negative I think that (13:07 - 13:13)
exists is Pokemon go is approaching the (13:10 - 13:16)
Event Horizon (13:13 - 13:21)
of there are so many things in the game (13:16 - 13:25)
that people who are more casual or (13:21 - 13:27)
trying to pick it up at the first time (13:25 - 13:30)
can easily get completely lost in what's (13:27 - 13:34)
going on in this I'm surprised you think (13:30 - 13:36)
it's still approaching that I have (13:34 - 13:39)
talked to so many people who don't (13:36 - 13:40)
understand Pokemon go anymore when they (13:39 - 13:42)
start playing it yeah I mean I think I (13:40 - 13:45)
think for some people we are there but I (13:42 - 13:48)
think like this is there is definitely a (13:45 - 13:49)
point (13:48 - 13:52)
where they have to add in so many things (13:49 - 13:54)
at the beginning and trainer tips and (13:52 - 13:57)
hey hey hey hey that the game for a lot (13:54 - 14:00)
of people becomes an IM immediate like I (13:57 - 14:02)
can't read all of this and I'm I am no (14:00 - 14:03)
longer interested I don't know that (14:02 - 14:06)
we're there that for a majority of (14:03 - 14:07)
people but I (14:06 - 14:11)
think they are definitely pivoting away (14:07 - 14:15)
from being an easy and accessible game (14:11 - 14:18)
um to able to keep their core audience (14:15 - 14:21)
happy so I think we are sort of at a (14:18 - 14:25)
balance point of they're just going to (14:21 - 14:28)
keep adding things and I think while for (14:25 - 14:30)
people who love the game that is always (14:28 - 14:33)
going to be a value ad I think we're (14:30 - 14:34)
very close to the point where they're (14:33 - 14:36)
adding things for anybody new joining it (14:34 - 14:38)
is a big (14:36 - 14:41)
detractor um routes aren't great like (14:38 - 14:44)
they aren't like it's not a great (14:41 - 14:45)
feature the routes that I run into (14:44 - 14:48)
aren't technically wonderful either so (14:45 - 14:50)
like this is adding a thing to sort of a (14:48 - 14:52)
bad thing that exists to make it (14:50 - 14:54)
slightly better but also explaining (14:52 - 14:58)
routes to people and their benefit is (14:54 - 15:01)
also somewhat difficult to do um the (14:58 - 15:04)
thing I think about with routes why I I (15:01 - 15:06)
do tend to agree with Greg here is when (15:04 - 15:08)
you go to Mall of America I mean we've (15:06 - 15:10)
brought this up before and you go to (15:08 - 15:13)
open up routes there are eight plus (15:10 - 15:16)
routes that are all the same which is (15:13 - 15:19)
walk in the giant Circle that is Mall of (15:16 - 15:23)
America which in itself is not a bad (15:19 - 15:25)
concept you're going to be it takes up (15:23 - 15:27)
you know for we I took a friend to M (15:25 - 15:29)
America for the first time and it took (15:27 - 15:31)
us almost 2 hours to get through that (15:29 - 15:33)
Circle because we were stopping at (15:31 - 15:35)
stores like we they were like oh my gosh (15:33 - 15:36)
like I want to go here but like when (15:35 - 15:38)
Greg and I are at mall America we can (15:36 - 15:39)
get through that Circle in like 15 (15:38 - 15:43)
minutes yeah we're just walking where we (15:39 - 15:46)
have no desire to shop or or look around (15:43 - 15:48)
so like the the circle route in Mall of (15:46 - 15:51)
America makes complete sense but there's (15:48 - 15:53)
eight of them but there's eight of them (15:51 - 15:55)
when you're a casual person or like oh (15:53 - 15:56)
what is this new route feature and (15:55 - 15:58)
you're you're presented with eight (15:56 - 16:00)
different routes which which one do I (15:58 - 16:03)
pick does it matter should it matter why (16:00 - 16:05)
are there so many does one give me more (16:03 - 16:07)
like I know the answers to all these (16:05 - 16:08)
questions like no it doesn't matter no (16:07 - 16:11)
it doesn't matter doesn't give better (16:08 - 16:14)
rewards but like my hope is that maybe (16:11 - 16:16)
eventually they will be able to check (16:14 - 16:20)
for routes that have 90% of the route be (16:16 - 16:22)
the exact same space and the exact same (16:20 - 16:26)
path and then rely on those ratings (16:22 - 16:27)
they've been asking everyone for to (16:26 - 16:30)
maybe try and grab the best one because (16:27 - 16:32)
sometimes a starting stop Point can be (16:30 - 16:34)
better than another starting stop point (16:32 - 16:35)
for one that is essentially the same (16:34 - 16:43)
route but they let go 230 people so no I (16:35 - 16:46)
know what you know I remember there was (16:43 - 16:49)
uh Niantic invited a bunch of content (16:46 - 16:52)
creators out to Seattle very last minute (16:49 - 16:55)
I was not (16:52 - 16:57)
invited sometimes they invite me to (16:55 - 16:59)
stuff sometimes they don't I don't know (16:57 - 17:01)
the Rhyme or Reason why they invited the (16:59 - 17:04)
creators they did I I don't I don't know (17:01 - 17:05)
but they all they all said the same (17:04 - 17:07)
thing right we can't talk about it can't (17:05 - 17:10)
talk about what Niantic showed showed us (17:07 - 17:13)
but they showed us some exciting things (17:10 - 17:17)
um I I I'm in a lot of meetings with (17:13 - 17:19)
Niantic I don't know if anything they've (17:17 - 17:23)
ever said has been particularly exciting (17:19 - 17:23)
uh anything but no no not really like (17:23 - 17:30)
like I feel like the things that Niantic (17:27 - 17:32)
has has launched or shown have been like (17:30 - 17:35)
yeah duh yeah why why would why would (17:32 - 17:38)
you like like even even they they like (17:35 - 17:42)
routes came from Ingress so even when I (17:38 - 17:44)
think I heard about routes early which I (17:42 - 17:46)
I don't even remember I was like oh (17:44 - 17:48)
you're just pulling that from Ingus that (17:46 - 17:49)
makes sense yeah like that's there's (17:48 - 17:51)
nothing there's no surprise there like (17:49 - 17:53)
that makes sense that a thing that works (17:51 - 17:55)
in your other game you were putting in (17:53 - 17:57)
this game like okay totally totally (17:55 - 17:59)
makes sense um like I I don't know what (17:57 - 18:01)
nian could do to surprise me at this (17:59 - 18:02)
point even if they were like we're (18:01 - 18:06)
introducing a monthly membership for $10 (18:02 - 18:08)
a month and you get like again not would (18:06 - 18:11)
be a surprise they could do the same (18:08 - 18:12)
thing they did with the mega system and (18:11 - 18:14)
update things that already exist to make (18:12 - 18:17)
them better and more (18:14 - 18:20)
stable yeah I guess I guess revamping (18:17 - 18:23)
the mega system was a surprise yeah (18:20 - 18:26)
because like they actually did did it (18:23 - 18:30)
right yes but like I think about that (18:26 - 18:32)
meeting which gosh I felt like was at (18:30 - 18:35)
the beginning of this year it was it (18:32 - 18:39)
was definitely after hoen Fest but like (18:35 - 18:41)
before go Fest I (18:39 - 18:45)
think and like what did they show like (18:41 - 18:49)
if if you think about what like I like I (18:45 - 18:50)
somebody's like Steve why don't you just (18:49 - 18:52)
ask them like I understand that they (18:50 - 18:53)
probably signed a separate NDA that I (18:52 - 18:55)
didn't sign so like even though like (18:53 - 18:57)
Niantic does tell me things early they (18:55 - 18:59)
like I don't want to get anyone trouble (18:57 - 19:01)
I'm not like the police like I but but I (18:59 - 19:03)
can sit here and speculate like what (19:01 - 19:06)
could Niantic possibly have shown these (19:03 - 19:09)
select creators to get them excited for (19:06 - 19:11)
those creators to go on make a YouTube (19:09 - 19:13)
video of like Niantic showed me some (19:11 - 19:16)
exciting things trainers don't be (19:13 - 19:18)
discouraged I don't think any of them (19:16 - 19:21)
reacted quite that positively maybe (19:18 - 19:22)
we're remembering it differently but I'm (19:21 - 19:24)
not sure any of them actually said they (19:22 - 19:27)
were excited they said it was cool but (19:24 - 19:29)
what was cool team (19:27 - 19:31)
Party play or routes would be my guess (19:29 - 19:33)
play So yeah so the only things I can (19:31 - 19:36)
think of is Team Rocket raids Party play (19:33 - 19:38)
and (19:36 - 19:42)
routes they're fine I don't I think like (19:38 - 19:45)
I think Party play was probably the (19:42 - 19:47)
thing that maybe they got excit would (19:45 - 19:50)
generate the most oh that's cool because (19:47 - 19:53)
it is a pretty decent feature uh I think (19:50 - 19:55)
route on (19:53 - 19:59)
paper sounds good (19:55 - 20:03)
I think both put into practice are very (19:59 - 20:05)
different than what it sounds like on (20:03 - 20:08)
paper right like you can (20:05 - 20:11)
really talk something up uh be like oh (20:08 - 20:14)
it's going to be these and and let leave (20:11 - 20:16)
enough to the imagination that people (20:14 - 20:18)
who love these series will fill that in (20:16 - 20:20)
with whatever they're excited about and (20:18 - 20:22)
then the reality hits and it does not (20:20 - 20:26)
live up to any of that right so I I can (20:22 - 20:28)
imagine that a lot of that was the (20:26 - 20:32)
initial like here's some screen grabs (20:28 - 20:33)
here's how it's going to work here's the (20:32 - 20:35)
features that we want and then (20:33 - 20:37)
implementation was vastly different than (20:35 - 20:40)
what was presented that is pretty common (20:37 - 20:46)
across most business things um and I do (20:40 - 20:49)
think of the things they introduced (20:46 - 20:51)
probably the most effective was Party (20:49 - 20:54)
play because it adds a feature that (20:51 - 20:57)
should have always really have been (20:54 - 21:00)
there in a game that you (20:57 - 21:03)
know portrays itself as you out playing (21:00 - 21:04)
with your community and with your (21:03 - 21:05)
friends there should have been always (21:04 - 21:08)
sort of a way for you to get into the (21:05 - 21:10)
same game together and get some benefit (21:08 - 21:14)
from that uh that was just like left out (21:10 - 21:15)
I think (21:14 - 21:19)
routes on paper with the Assumption I (21:15 - 21:20)
think I don't think it would have been a (21:19 - 21:22)
hard assumption to assume that Niantic (21:20 - 21:24)
would have launched with things that (21:22 - 21:26)
they made or curated ones and they (21:24 - 21:29)
didn't right like they relied on a (21:26 - 21:31)
community (21:29 - 21:36)
that has a vested interest to make it (21:31 - 21:39)
the the fastest cheapest way to get the (21:36 - 21:43)
reward at the end and the routes reflect (21:39 - 21:46)
that yeah you you I like I totally get (21:43 - 21:50)
the community like Niantic lost 240 (21:46 - 21:53)
people even if they dedicated 200 people (21:50 - 21:57)
to routes which is a lot like they (21:53 - 22:00)
don't they no one lives in Jackson (21:57 - 22:02)
Wisconsin they don't know what the best (22:00 - 22:03)
possible route over there would be (22:02 - 22:08)
somebody in that City town would be best (22:03 - 22:10)
at making a route but when you put the (22:08 - 22:12)
community in charge they're like I'm (22:10 - 22:13)
just going to make the shortest thing (22:12 - 22:14)
because I just want the zygard thing at (22:13 - 22:17)
the end I think before they announced (22:14 - 22:19)
that there was the whole Zygarde tie in (22:17 - 22:21)
people were making potentially better (22:19 - 22:24)
longer more fun routes and then when the (22:21 - 22:28)
whole Zygarde cell stuff got tied in (22:24 - 22:31)
that's when people go for the short (22:28 - 22:35)
nearby routes yeah even you who made a (22:31 - 22:37)
big route had a problem getting it (22:35 - 22:41)
approved yep immediately do immediately (22:37 - 22:44)
rejected I I made a route in Japan from (22:41 - 22:47)
the train station to the lucky cat (22:44 - 22:50)
Shrine it's like a 12 minute walk it's (22:47 - 22:53)
not it's not short but like this is the (22:50 - 22:56)
the the the scenic route which it's like (22:53 - 22:57)
the only way to get there you got to (22:56 - 22:59)
walk through like the small town and (22:57 - 23:02)
then like turn left it is still under (22:59 - 23:07)
review in Japan months ago it is still (23:02 - 23:10)
under (23:07 - 23:10)
review uh they also (23:11 - 23:15)
announced (23:15 - 23:21)
a new ticket starting December 1st (23:17 - 23:22)
trainers will be able to purchase a (23:21 - 23:25)
ticket for the Expedition access in (23:22 - 23:27)
December Expedition access includes (23:25 - 23:29)
timed research opport unities and (23:27 - 23:32)
bountiful bonuses their words not mine (23:29 - 23:33)
that Supply trainers with incubators (23:32 - 23:36)
gift storage and extra XP there will be (23:33 - 23:40)
an expedition EG eggs like a Pokemon egg (23:36 - 23:43)
uh access Ticket available each month in (23:40 - 23:45)
Pokemon go Timeless travels so you can (23:43 - 23:48)
keep the bonuses going all season long (23:45 - 23:50)
what that means is for the next three (23:48 - 23:53)
months there will be a $5 purchase or (23:50 - 23:54)
maybe they'll increase the price right (23:53 - 23:57)
now it's $5 so $15 for this season if (23:54 - 23:59)
you want to grab these whatever these we (23:57 - 24:01)
don't know what the next two (23:59 - 24:04)
are each month's Expedition will provide (24:01 - 24:05)
new timed research that unlocks at the (24:04 - 24:07)
start of the month you'll have the end (24:05 - 24:08)
of the month to complete the task which (24:07 - 24:11)
provides opportunities for XP Stardust (24:08 - 24:13)
and encounters with Pokemon found in the (24:11 - 24:16)
Hui region such as (24:13 - 24:21)
Gibble totic and Hui and growth three (24:16 - 24:24)
vastly rare Pokemon that you can spend (24:21 - 24:29)
$5 to get one encounter with (24:24 - 24:31)
trainers trainers are free to complete (24:29 - 24:33)
December time research and claim their (24:31 - 24:36)
rewards at any point trainers May (24:33 - 24:38)
purchase the Expedition until December (24:36 - 24:40)
29th I don't know why you would purchase (24:38 - 24:43)
it the very last day but you could uh (24:40 - 24:45)
and skip a lot of (24:43 - 24:48)
rewards uh it's $5 what you get here is (24:45 - 24:51)
you will get one single use incubator (24:48 - 24:55)
for your first spin a day that means for (24:51 - 24:58)
$5 you can get 31 single use incubator s (24:55 - 25:01)
which I you got to do the math a normal (24:58 - 25:04)
incubator is what like a dollar it gives (25:01 - 25:05)
you (25:04 - 25:08)
three I think you are still technically (25:05 - 25:09)
saving (25:08 - 25:12)
money because five incubators would be (25:09 - 25:16)
15 there you go so this is getting you (25:12 - 25:20)
31 um you will get three times the uh XP (25:16 - 25:23)
for your first catch three times the XP (25:20 - 25:25)
for your first spin you can open 50 (25:23 - 25:29)
gifts instead of 20 you can send 150 (25:25 - 25:32)
gifts instead of sending 100 I don't (25:29 - 25:33)
know who that's benefiting who is (25:32 - 25:36)
sending 100 gifts a day please I would (25:33 - 25:38)
like to know your your name and your (25:36 - 25:40)
address who is sending a 100 gifts a day (25:38 - 25:43)
you could though now you can send (25:40 - 25:45)
150 um that's going to take you about (25:43 - 25:48)
six hours a day to do but you can do (25:45 - 25:51)
that uh and then you can hold 40 gifts (25:48 - 25:54)
in your bag instead of holding (25:51 - 25:59)
20 um this is getting very close close (25:54 - 26:02)
to a monthly membership without them (25:59 - 26:05)
saying that I would just just just do it (26:02 - 26:07)
just just (26:05 - 26:09)
do5 a month and this is what you just (26:07 - 26:13)
just do it yeah I agree it's getting (26:09 - 26:14)
kind of tiring for the people who will (26:13 - 26:16)
just be buying them each (26:14 - 26:19)
month yeah (26:16 - 26:21)
just gosh I would rather pay $10 a month (26:19 - 26:23)
in Pokemon sleep at least they they're (26:21 - 26:25)
like in three months you'll get a (26:23 - 26:29)
gracious reward for like just (26:25 - 26:32)
do the monthly membership at this (26:29 - 26:35)
point I do I do think if you are (26:32 - 26:36)
somebody who likes (26:35 - 26:38)
incubators I don't know why you wouldn't (26:36 - 26:40)
buy this it's technically a better deal (26:38 - 26:43)
than buying incubators it is although (26:40 - 26:45)
I've heard so many people talk about how (26:43 - 26:47)
eggs are one of the worst parts of the (26:45 - 26:49)
game that that's something that could (26:47 - 26:50)
use a revamp if we're talking about (26:49 - 26:51)
somewhere that it would actually (26:50 - 26:54)
surprise and make people happy to see (26:51 - 26:56)
new things in this game revamping the (26:54 - 26:59)
egg system but what do they revamp it (26:56 - 27:01)
too I mean the biggest disappointment (26:59 - 27:04)
are the things that hatch from the (27:01 - 27:07)
eggs I'm telling you I'm telling you I I (27:04 - 27:09)
think eggs eggs need to be changed to (27:07 - 27:12)
steps like Pikmin and they need to give (27:09 - 27:14)
you two incubators instead of one that's (27:12 - 27:15)
all they have to do to revamp it because (27:14 - 27:17)
in Pikmin you get two for free they're (27:15 - 27:19)
called Planters you get two planters for (27:17 - 27:20)
free you can buy more Planters you (27:19 - 27:22)
really don't need to because when you're (27:20 - 27:23)
when you're when it's when it's (27:22 - 27:26)
step-based and it's like this Pikmin is (27:23 - 27:28)
a th steps this Pikmin is 3,000 steps (27:26 - 27:31)
this is 5,000 this is 10,000 it's just (27:28 - 27:32)
so much easier in your mind to (27:31 - 27:35)
comprehend on top of it doesn't feel (27:32 - 27:38)
that bad when you're doing like an a (27:35 - 27:39)
thousand because you can be like I'm (27:38 - 27:41)
going to knock out two a thousands right (27:39 - 27:42)
now because you can because you get two (27:41 - 27:44)
and then if they end up being two (27:42 - 27:45)
shelers each you're like okay no big (27:44 - 27:48)
deal those were the easiest like there's (27:45 - 27:50)
it just feels better when when you're (27:48 - 27:53)
walking for what 10 kilometers and you (27:50 - 27:56)
hatch a a a (27:53 - 27:58)
gy you're like I walked all of this for (27:56 - 27:59)
a (27:58 - 28:01)
go I feel like go is still one of the (27:59 - 28:03)
better ones (28:01 - 28:06)
too I'm I'm usually someone who's been (28:03 - 28:08)
on the fence about whether I want them (28:06 - 28:10)
to bring Pokemon breeding to Pokémon go (28:08 - 28:12)
or not but I feel like as they have more (28:10 - 28:15)
and more Pokemon in the game and they (28:12 - 28:18)
are able to have fewer just a smaller (28:15 - 28:20)
percentage of all of those available at (28:18 - 28:21)
any given (28:20 - 28:24)
time the ability to maybe potentially (28:21 - 28:26)
breed Pokemon and hatch eggs from that (28:24 - 28:29)
becomes more and more useful if you're (28:26 - 28:30)
looking for a Pokemon that just isn't (28:29 - 28:32)
spawning and hasn't been spawning for (28:30 - 28:34)
months on (28:32 - 28:37)
end and you want a better one for PVP or (28:34 - 28:40)
something like that it could be really (28:37 - 28:42)
useful (28:40 - 28:44)
yeah (28:42 - 28:49)
um I saw some people say that this $5 (28:44 - 28:52)
sucks because Niantic used to give free (28:49 - 28:55)
incubators around December which is kind (28:52 - 28:58)
of true like they did it was always like (28:55 - 29:00)
Christmas Eve Christmas Day and the day (28:58 - 29:02)
after Christmas like it is it is the (29:00 - 29:05)
days that you're like not incentivized (29:02 - 29:07)
to leave your house because one nothing (29:05 - 29:09)
is open and two you're like supposed to (29:07 - 29:11)
be with family so like maybe there was (29:09 - 29:13)
like four or five days they did that but (29:11 - 29:15)
it wasn't the whole month they also (29:13 - 29:17)
still could do that that's gonna be at (29:15 - 29:20)
the end of the month and has yet to be (29:17 - 29:23)
announced um I think Niantic has (29:20 - 29:26)
realized people like holding 40 gifts I (29:23 - 29:29)
think people like like opening a lot of (29:26 - 29:32)
gifts I I and when I say that I think (29:29 - 29:33)
like not the Casual person the hardcore (29:32 - 29:35)
person like if you are somebody who is (29:33 - 29:37)
grinding experience like opening as many (29:35 - 29:39)
gifts as possible to then get that (29:37 - 29:43)
friendship up matters I do think in a (29:39 - 29:47)
paid membership sense that is an obvious (29:43 - 29:49)
of like you're paying five or $10 a (29:47 - 29:52)
month and you get to hold more gifts I (29:49 - 29:54)
think that is just an obvious I do think (29:52 - 29:56)
people being like well there are used to (29:54 - 29:59)
be you could hold more gifts for free (29:56 - 30:00)
yeah for certain Seasons or certain (29:59 - 30:01)
events you could definitely hold more (30:00 - 30:04)
gifts for free (30:01 - 30:06)
um it's helpful and it is a good way to (30:04 - 30:08)
get experience but it's also (30:06 - 30:11)
exhausting yeah it's super timec (30:08 - 30:14)
consuming to open a bunch of gifts uh (30:11 - 30:16)
and be like your bag I think right now (30:14 - 30:18)
it doesn't say your bag is full it like (30:16 - 30:20)
just autoc converts it to Stardust or (30:18 - 30:22)
something you can turn that on in (30:20 - 30:26)
settings yeah (30:22 - 30:29)
um like I I I (30:26 - 30:31)
don't I don't think like you can safely (30:29 - 30:34)
ignore it like you you can pay the $5 or (30:31 - 30:36)
you can't (30:34 - 30:39)
um I was gifted a ticket so thank you (30:36 - 30:41)
who gifted me a ticket I probably would (30:39 - 30:43)
have bought it I (30:41 - 30:45)
think uh I probably would have bought it (30:43 - 30:47)
honestly because I would I would want (30:45 - 30:49)
the 31 incubators but I I'm I'm not (30:47 - 30:51)
going to use a single one of those (30:49 - 30:54)
incubators until the c tour which I (30:51 - 30:57)
guess we can transition to the c tour (30:54 - 30:58)
here (30:57 - 31:01)
[Music] (30:58 - 31:04)
um this this is this event (31:01 - 31:09)
is 75 days away Los Angeles California (31:04 - 31:12)
from the 17th to the 18th look this has (31:09 - 31:14)
nothing to do with the event this is a (31:12 - 31:16)
separate opinion of mine I hate Los (31:14 - 31:21)
Angeles oh (31:16 - 31:21)
yeah and I know people are like I love (31:23 - 31:29)
Los Angeles great opportunities I'm sure (31:26 - 31:32)
totally it's a big city it's very (31:29 - 31:35)
big uh terrible public transportation (31:32 - 31:39)
gridlock traffic everything is super (31:35 - 31:41)
expensive uh I was talking to another (31:39 - 31:43)
content creator and they're like yeah my (31:41 - 31:45)
my like two-bedroom apartment is like (31:43 - 31:48)
$6,000 a month or whatever in California (31:45 - 31:51)
I'm like like I got a whole house not (31:48 - 31:53)
even close to that amount of money with (31:51 - 31:57)
a garage my own yard I mean here's the (31:53 - 32:00)
thing for an (31:57 - 32:00)
event in (32:00 - 32:06)
February La will probably have nice (32:02 - 32:08)
weather that's true that's true Greg (32:06 - 32:10)
always looking at the positive side the (32:08 - 32:13)
most positive person on this podcast is (32:10 - 32:17)
Greg that's me known for my positivity (32:13 - 32:21)
100% of the time otherwise La stinks um (32:17 - 32:24)
let's not talk about how bad LAX is you (32:21 - 32:25)
want to get out of LAX it's going to be (32:24 - 32:29)
a $100 on a new (32:25 - 32:29)
I mean unless there's some magic light (32:30 - 32:34)
rail that I don't know exists at LAX (32:32 - 32:36)
that'll get you no there's not it's (32:34 - 32:39)
California they've had uh there were (32:36 - 32:41)
supposed to be but a certain somebody uh (32:39 - 32:44)
killed that so uh for the record I don't (32:41 - 32:46)
think all of California is bad no I (32:44 - 32:48)
would rather go to San Francisco or San (32:46 - 32:50)
Diego any day over La I would not want (32:48 - 32:53)
to go to San Diego s San Diego is real (32:50 - 32:55)
bad yeah but Bob Bob is in San Diego (32:53 - 32:58)
that makes it worth it alone oh Bob (32:55 - 32:59)
move (32:58 - 33:03)
um La so la (32:59 - 33:09)
is a very very big city and unlike New (33:03 - 33:11)
York which is a very big city La does (33:09 - 33:15)
not have a great a public transit system (33:11 - 33:17)
and B (33:15 - 33:20)
roads um there are too many people all (33:17 - 33:23)
of who have cars so it's incredibly (33:20 - 33:24)
difficult to get (33:23 - 33:29)
around because La is La it's got (33:24 - 33:34)
generally decent weather and in the (33:29 - 33:38)
winter time it's a big tourist season (33:34 - 33:42)
there is no way to find appropriately (33:38 - 33:46)
priced hotels or (33:42 - 33:48)
Transportation (33:46 - 33:54)
or many many many other things um I (33:48 - 33:58)
don't I understand from a company why (33:54 - 34:01)
you would pick la like it is a big (33:58 - 34:05)
central location on the west coast it's (34:01 - 34:07)
generally people in California can get (34:05 - 34:10)
to it know how to get to it it's if you (34:07 - 34:12)
want to make a big weekend out of it (34:10 - 34:14)
Disneyland is right there like there's a (34:12 - 34:19)
lot to do in LA right there it is I mean (34:14 - 34:21)
it's right there like from The Rose bow (34:19 - 34:23)
to Disneyland It's like a 2hour drive (34:21 - 34:24)
well I (34:23 - 34:27)
mean okay compare it to driving it from (34:24 - 34:30)
here yeah sure sure sure sure I I mean (34:27 - 34:32)
they at least support getting you to (34:30 - 34:35)
Disneyland easily unlike anything like (34:32 - 34:38)
you can get to Disneyland real easy from (34:35 - 34:40)
La (34:38 - 34:46)
um it is just a very expensive expensive (34:40 - 34:48)
city to travel (34:46 - 34:52)
to it flights particular winter are (34:48 - 34:53)
going to be very very expensive staying (34:52 - 34:55)
there is very expensive and it's just (34:53 - 34:57)
hard to get around I can talk about that (34:55 - 35:00)
um because I I booked my stuff uh (34:57 - 35:01)
sometimes Niantic pays for me sometimes (35:00 - 35:03)
they don't maybe they'll pay for me for (35:01 - 35:05)
this trip I'm not holding my breath (35:03 - 35:07)
because uh it's very close to the start (35:05 - 35:08)
of the year and they probably don't have (35:07 - 35:10)
budgets approved I know this just (35:08 - 35:11)
because like that's literally every (35:10 - 35:14)
company is like it's really hard to get (35:11 - 35:18)
your yearly budget for whatever travel (35:14 - 35:19)
um they did not pay for me to go to home (35:18 - 35:22)
and tour they did pay for me to go to (35:19 - 35:24)
South Korea I'm just saying that as full (35:22 - 35:28)
disclosure um they did eventually pay (35:24 - 35:31)
for my hotel in Osaka just Again full (35:28 - 35:32)
disclosure it only took them like four (35:31 - 35:34)
months to pay for that hotel but they (35:32 - 35:35)
did pay for that hotel which is very (35:34 - 35:38)
nice of them um so I booked my flight it (35:35 - 35:42)
was $480 roundtrip from MSP to LAX not (35:38 - 35:45)
the worst ever not the best it was on (35:42 - 35:49)
average um and then uh my hotel which (35:45 - 35:52)
was the hardest part was uh (35:49 - 35:57)
$1,400 for 5 days uh which is expensive (35:52 - 36:00)
uh in my opinion uh I think I I stayed (35:57 - 36:02)
in Korea for two weeks I don't think I (36:00 - 36:05)
came close to $1,400 yeah that's twice (36:02 - 36:07)
what I paid for the the same amount of (36:05 - 36:12)
time I think in New York for go Fest uh (36:07 - 36:15)
so that's a lot for a game that is a lot (36:12 - 36:17)
to but to be fair you know people spend (36:15 - 36:20)
that much to go see Blink 182 or to go (36:17 - 36:24)
to Disneyland right like traveling is (36:20 - 36:26)
expensive I am going to hopefully get to (36:24 - 36:28)
see some part of Los Angeles that I (36:26 - 36:31)
haven't seen but the the the thing that (36:28 - 36:33)
is not talked about and like why my (36:31 - 36:34)
hotel was so expensive is the (36:33 - 36:37)
transportation cost yeah it's going to (36:34 - 36:41)
cost $100 to get from LAX to Pasadena (36:37 - 36:43)
which is Tech this this event is in (36:41 - 36:46)
Pasadena it is in Pasadena like people (36:43 - 36:48)
people when they see oh it's Rose Bel in (36:46 - 36:51)
La understand it is not in Los Angeles (36:48 - 36:53)
downtown Los Angeles you are not going (36:51 - 36:56)
to get to West Hollywood or Hollywood or (36:53 - 37:00)
Beverly Hills are Universal because (36:56 - 37:05)
Pasadena is Way east of there so it's a (37:00 - 37:08)
Pasadena event with the ability to say (37:05 - 37:10)
hey you can buy City tickets to go (37:08 - 37:13)
through Los Angeles um Los Angeles is (37:10 - 37:18)
not easy to walk either um also it's (37:13 - 37:21)
nowhere near any of the beaches because (37:18 - 37:23)
it's it's pretty much on the opposite (37:21 - 37:28)
side of a very very very big city (37:23 - 37:31)
um yeah yeah but like this this this was (37:28 - 37:34)
the the part of like I picked a hotel in (37:31 - 37:35)
Pasadena which is like slightly more (37:34 - 37:37)
expensive because Pasadena is a more (37:35 - 37:41)
expensive city and my thought process is (37:37 - 37:45)
well I spent $1,400 for a hotel spent (37:41 - 37:47)
$500 on a flight it's going to take $100 (37:45 - 37:50)
to get to my hotel from the airport $100 (37:47 - 37:52)
to get to the airport so that's $200 (37:50 - 37:56)
right there there's nothing close to the (37:52 - 37:58)
Rose Bowl that is is like walkable like (37:56 - 38:00)
it it's not like a Convention Center (37:58 - 38:02)
where like oh I'm staying in Boston for (38:00 - 38:05)
PA East and my hotel is literally con (38:02 - 38:06)
connected to the convention center or (38:05 - 38:08)
there's like oh there's like a there's I (38:06 - 38:10)
can just take the the subway to the (38:08 - 38:12)
convention center in Boston for like two (38:10 - 38:16)
bucks there doesn't exist there unless (38:12 - 38:18)
again there's some magic that I'm not (38:16 - 38:20)
missing on the internet the only way to (38:18 - 38:23)
get to the Rose Bowl is to drive my (38:20 - 38:25)
hotel in Pasadena is as pretty close as (38:23 - 38:29)
you can get and it's a 45 minute walk I (38:25 - 38:32)
I'm going to tell you this pass it so (38:29 - 38:35)
from LAX pass it into Rose rosebowl is (38:32 - 38:38)
28 miles (38:35 - 38:40)
away Disneyland is (38:38 - 38:44)
34 but it's like in the opposite (38:40 - 38:46)
direction so (38:44 - 38:48)
both (38:46 - 38:50)
are that like when people think like oh (38:48 - 38:53)
well Disneyland isn't anywhere near La (38:50 - 38:57)
neither is this like understand Pasadena (38:53 - 39:00)
isn't by Los Angeles like in the same (38:57 - 39:02)
way that Anaheim is technically in Los (39:00 - 39:06)
Angeles so is Pasadena and yeah they (39:02 - 39:09)
both use really really really bad (39:06 - 39:12)
highways the only thing that is (39:09 - 39:15)
easier (39:12 - 39:18)
is technically there's a much more (39:15 - 39:21)
direct route to Disneyland Highway wise (39:18 - 39:23)
than there is to (39:21 - 39:25)
Pasadena but (39:23 - 39:28)
like you can go to the road Bowl one day (39:25 - 39:30)
out of your your thing so the event is (39:28 - 39:32)
you pick either a Saturday or a Sunday (39:30 - 39:35)
for the Rose Bowl and then you can do (39:32 - 39:37)
your add-ons your city experience (39:35 - 39:38)
add-ons so you can e if you pick (39:37 - 39:41)
Saturday you can add on Sunday but you (39:38 - 39:44)
can also add on Friday as a Citywide (39:41 - 39:45)
experience which is actually really (39:44 - 39:47)
great honestly I wouldn't be surprised (39:45 - 39:49)
if there are some people who live in LA (39:47 - 39:51)
that just do all three and then never go (39:49 - 39:54)
to the Rose Bowl and probably have a (39:51 - 39:57)
great time they're like you know what (39:54 - 39:58)
I'm just going to hang out at Santa (39:57 - 40:00)
Monica Beach I'm just going to play (39:58 - 40:02)
Pokemon go for three days I did buy a (40:00 - 40:03)
ticket to the Rose Bowl but I didn't (40:02 - 40:04)
show up and I still had a great time I'm (40:03 - 40:08)
sure that will happen and exist yeah um (40:04 - 40:11)
so as an (40:08 - 40:13)
event I don't think it's bad like I'm (40:11 - 40:16)
not like mad at Niantic for picking La I (40:13 - 40:17)
understand why they did I'm just (40:16 - 40:19)
expressing how like if you are (40:17 - 40:22)
considering going and you are not from (40:19 - 40:24)
the California area it's going to be (40:22 - 40:26)
more expensive like this is this already (40:24 - 40:29)
is is more expensive than Las (40:26 - 40:33)
Vegas uh like I think my Las Vegas hotel (40:29 - 40:35)
for the same 5 days was like $700 this (40:33 - 40:42)
is already double um to be in LA (40:35 - 40:42)
and The Uber to and from that Park which (40:42 - 40:47)
I did complain about at the time there (40:45 - 40:48)
there was no there was no like light (40:47 - 40:51)
rail or any way to get to that Park (40:48 - 40:52)
either (40:51 - 40:55)
um your only option was to like walk (40:52 - 40:56)
across the street to Subway and then (40:55 - 40:58)
order in Uber because that small Park (40:56 - 41:00)
parking lot wasn't able to like (40:58 - 41:03)
accommodate everything I guess you could (41:00 - 41:05)
like rent a car but I don't want to I (41:03 - 41:07)
don't want to drive an hour from the (41:05 - 41:09)
airport to my hotel and then figure out (41:07 - 41:11)
how to park a car and then drive it to (41:09 - 41:13)
the Rose Bowl which would have it's only (41:11 - 41:17)
a f minute drive a 45 minute walk but (41:13 - 41:19)
when I think about books somebody's (41:17 - 41:21)
probably like writing on YouTube like (41:19 - 41:24)
just book a hotel farther out but the (41:21 - 41:27)
Uber gets more expensive yeah (41:24 - 41:31)
also especially in LA and also I'm like (41:27 - 41:34)
if I'm stuck in the city for five days (41:31 - 41:36)
like downtown Pasadena actually has a (41:34 - 41:39)
lot of things to do and I remember when (41:36 - 41:42)
I flew to St Louis for a community day (41:39 - 41:44)
which Niantic did pay for that (41:42 - 41:46)
experience as well um that was when (41:44 - 41:49)
Niantic was like we want you to go to (41:46 - 41:50)
cities that have Community ambassadors (41:49 - 41:52)
and I was like okay I guess I'll go to (41:50 - 41:54)
St Louis then if you're paying for it so (41:52 - 41:56)
the one when I went to St Louis and I (41:54 - 41:58)
got rained out out I did pick a (41:56 - 42:01)
relatively I picked a a hotel next to (41:58 - 42:04)
the airport and there was nothing around (42:01 - 42:07)
it also I don't like St Louis I St Louis (42:04 - 42:08)
is one of the worst cities I've ever (42:07 - 42:10)
been to but (42:08 - 42:12)
like for all the people that are like (42:10 - 42:15)
just pick a hotel farther away like you (42:12 - 42:17)
know what sucks is walking out of your (42:15 - 42:19)
hotel and just seeing parking lots (42:17 - 42:23)
around you it is not a great way to (42:19 - 42:25)
experience a new city also like you ever (42:23 - 42:27)
walk out of your at 7: p.m. and like I (42:25 - 42:29)
want something to eat got to take an (42:27 - 42:32)
Uber got to take an Uber back like it is (42:29 - 42:34)
nice to walk out of your hotel and be (42:32 - 42:36)
like oh there's like 20 restaurants here (42:34 - 42:37)
to pick from oh there's a bunch of (42:36 - 42:39)
stores oh there's actually Poké stops (42:37 - 42:42)
here that I can do like there there is a (42:39 - 42:45)
bit of value in being like this hotel is (42:42 - 42:47)
like $50 more dollars a night but I'm (42:45 - 42:49)
also around (42:47 - 42:53)
civilization well I mean you you have to (42:49 - 42:57)
balance what you are paying for in (42:53 - 43:00)
travel costs versus opportunity costs (42:57 - 43:02)
right like yeah I can get a cheaper (43:00 - 43:03)
hotel but is it really cheaper if I have (43:02 - 43:04)
to (43:03 - 43:09)
spend La travel prices to get to (43:04 - 43:12)
something just even the ba most basic (43:09 - 43:15)
things like I have to pay a car to get (43:12 - 43:19)
me to a restaurant to eat because I (43:15 - 43:22)
don't have food or a kitchen in my hotel (43:19 - 43:24)
and I really thought they had figured (43:22 - 43:26)
out some of this after Vegas last year (43:24 - 43:28)
because at go Fest it was fantastic and (43:26 - 43:30)
I guess we can just chalk that up to New (43:28 - 43:32)
York having better transportation (43:30 - 43:33)
because there (43:32 - 43:36)
were York has better transportation than (43:33 - 43:39)
La it wasn't just relying on public (43:36 - 43:41)
transportation either they had shuttles (43:39 - 43:43)
to get there they had a fairy to get (43:41 - 43:45)
there they were advertising different (43:43 - 43:47)
ways and explaining different ways on (43:45 - 43:49)
how to get to the event and I'm not (43:47 - 43:52)
seeing any of this the fer was free but (43:49 - 43:54)
they have that option (43:52 - 43:57)
yeah um yeah I I I don't (43:54 - 43:58)
[Music] (43:57 - 44:03)
know what a PO that's a different (43:58 - 44:06)
culture of New York New Yorker lives on (44:03 - 44:07)
public transportation and people (44:06 - 44:10)
actively avoid cars whereas La it is (44:07 - 44:12)
cars cars cars cars cars cars (44:10 - 44:14)
cars yeah and it's a car culture in (44:12 - 44:18)
California it's a car is just a car city (44:14 - 44:20)
um not that you can get anywhere because (44:18 - 44:22)
I will tell you this the one time the (44:20 - 44:28)
last time I was in LA that I had a car (44:22 - 44:28)
to get across La at 1 in the (44:29 - 44:38)
morning was a 2hour trip because the (44:33 - 44:42)
traffic doesn't ever stop it took us 2 (44:38 - 44:46)
hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic at 1 (44:42 - 44:50)
a.m. to get from where my cousins (44:46 - 44:54)
lived to our hotel yep I have heard (44:50 - 44:56)
people reference that saying that it's (44:54 - 44:57)
easier iier to hop on a plane and get (44:56 - 44:59)
somewhere than it is to get from one (44:57 - 45:04)
side of LA to another it is absolutely (44:59 - 45:04)
correct uh before we go into what you (45:04 - 45:09)
are actually paying for at the event I (45:08 - 45:13)
think I think our our La whatever like (45:09 - 45:15)
again I understand why they picked La I (45:13 - 45:17)
totally get it I'm I the only reason I (45:15 - 45:20)
brought up the difficulties of La is (45:17 - 45:21)
because there are some people who have (45:20 - 45:24)
never been and I don't like I just want (45:21 - 45:25)
to lay it out that it's probably going (45:24 - 45:26)
to be a little more expensive (45:25 - 45:28)
Transportation kind of sucks here I (45:26 - 45:29)
already know that there are come some (45:28 - 45:31)
people from slack that are coming (45:29 - 45:33)
overseas just I just want to lay that (45:31 - 45:35)
out there that like LA's a little (45:33 - 45:38)
difficult it's it's a lot I hope they (45:35 - 45:40)
have food worked (45:38 - 45:42)
out at the event I hope they have food (45:40 - 45:44)
worked out also if you're listening and (45:42 - 45:46)
there's a restaurant you like in (45:44 - 45:48)
Pasadena please let me know I would I (45:46 - 45:50)
have no I've never been to Pasadena so (45:48 - 45:51)
anyways when we get back we're actually (45:50 - 45:53)
going to talk about the Pokemon aspect (45:51 - 45:55)
of this go tour and then we'll finish (45:53 - 45:57)
the rest of the show so we we will be (45:55 - 46:02)
right back and we are back from our (45:57 - 46:06)
break okay what does go Fest or go tour (46:02 - 46:11)
C get you go tour CNO sin tour so yeah (46:06 - 46:15)
go tour to no that's (46:11 - 46:15)
actually you're gonna get a new (46:16 - 46:20)
Masterwork re research uh that is going (46:17 - 46:21)
to get you an encounter with shiny (46:20 - 46:24)
Shaman a ticket for Masterwork with (46:21 - 46:25)
shiny Shaman will be available for (46:24 - 46:27)
purchase GL (46:25 - 46:29)
globally um the global Master workor (46:27 - 46:31)
research will be more challenging than (46:29 - 46:34)
Los Angeles counterpart part stay tuned (46:31 - 46:35)
for details they did the same thing with (46:34 - 46:37)
Gerra I think for like a good example (46:35 - 46:40)
with Gerra is like if you went to Vegas (46:37 - 46:41)
you only had to find Five K Leons if you (46:40 - 46:43)
didn't you had to find (46:41 - 46:48)
10 which finished that last (46:43 - 46:48)
month uh Diga and palia will be (46:49 - 46:54)
appearing in (46:53 - 46:56)
raids I thought this would be the (46:54 - 46:59)
opportunity for them to do origin (46:56 - 47:01)
form it might still (46:59 - 47:06)
be yes like if if your if your season is (47:01 - 47:08)
based on Legends (47:06 - 47:11)
archus and you're doing c (47:08 - 47:14)
tour like this is kind of your (47:11 - 47:16)
opportunity to do the origin forms here (47:14 - 47:18)
because uh I don't think we're getting a (47:16 - 47:22)
sequel to CNO anytime soon like this (47:18 - 47:23)
this is kind of where you pull the (47:22 - 47:25)
trigger on that right so either the (47:23 - 47:26)
origin forms are coming before this (47:25 - 47:30)
event or they are coming as a (47:26 - 47:33)
surprise yeah I I I would assume origin (47:30 - 47:36)
form at least well I don't know they (47:33 - 47:38)
could do it globally but that feels like (47:36 - 47:39)
kind of (47:38 - 47:43)
a kick in the knee Shin what do people (47:39 - 47:46)
say to the Vegas or the Los Angeles (47:43 - 47:51)
people sure kicking the shin yeah one of (47:46 - 47:54)
those um here's where the tour falls (47:51 - 47:57)
apart for me so I'll say special Pokemon (47:54 - 47:59)
appear in the (47:57 - 48:02)
wild for the entangled ruins you have (47:59 - 48:06)
Pikachu wearing a dawn hat you have (48:02 - 48:09)
tangala all right well that's not C you (48:06 - 48:11)
have Eevee that's that's not (48:09 - 48:15)
C you have mistris also not (48:11 - 48:20)
C then you have nose pass (48:15 - 48:20)
Roselia Duskull we're still not in CNO (48:20 - 48:26)
yet but hold on (48:24 - 48:31)
then we get T twig cric cricat plant (48:26 - 48:34)
cloak Burmy comi chery and bronzer half (48:31 - 48:37)
the Pokemon I just named for the C go (48:34 - 48:41)
tour are not C Pokemon now I know like (48:37 - 48:43)
eventually like yes Eevee evolves into (48:41 - 48:45)
Leafeon yes M Rous evolves into Miss (48:43 - 48:47)
Magus but there (48:45 - 48:50)
is something that kind of takes away (48:47 - 48:51)
from that and that's this isn't (48:50 - 48:54)
niantic's (48:51 - 48:58)
fault I mean (48:54 - 48:58)
for the record they didn't make the (48:58 - 49:02)
Pokedex you know I know everyone's mad (49:00 - 49:05)
at Gengar shiny at nanting did not make (49:02 - 49:06)
Gengar (49:05 - 49:09)
shiny you know let's get that out there (49:06 - 49:12)
but I I do think you know when you're (49:09 - 49:15)
paying for an experience like this and I (49:12 - 49:17)
do understand that Kanto and jotto were (49:15 - 49:20)
during covid and so they were they (49:17 - 49:22)
couldn't do like an in-person event (49:20 - 49:25)
would Niantic prefer to do an inperson (49:22 - 49:27)
event yeah of course like they they love (49:25 - 49:29)
their inperson events it makes them a (49:27 - 49:31)
ton of money they are a very like (49:29 - 49:33)
in-person (49:31 - 49:37)
company whatever uh there is something (49:33 - 49:40)
about having like all 150 Pokemon are (49:37 - 49:41)
spawning in the wild complete your (49:40 - 49:43)
entire Pokedex and then with Kanto it (49:41 - 49:45)
was like or jotto it's like a 100 (49:43 - 49:47)
Pokemon and yes I know some of those (49:45 - 49:49)
were based off whatever and then when (49:47 - 49:52)
you get to hoen it's like what like (49:49 - 49:56)
130 Pokemon I think for hoen with sinno (49:52 - 49:56)
it's (49:56 - 50:01)
like seven like 80 at most yeah it's (49:56 - 50:02)
small like it's not a lot like the (50:01 - 50:05)
Pokedex is really really weak and again (50:02 - 50:06)
that's not niantic's fault they didn't (50:05 - 50:09)
invent CNO it's just a weaker (50:06 - 50:11)
Pokedex (50:09 - 50:14)
um in your in your (50:11 - 50:16)
Seaside you have Pikachu wearing Dawn (50:14 - 50:19)
hat Magnemite Porygon routs like we're (50:16 - 50:20)
already getting like a Porygon Community (50:19 - 50:21)
deck (50:20 - 50:25)
again uh Piplup Starly be like no one (50:21 - 50:26)
wants another (50:25 - 50:28)
shiny Starly in their entire life but (50:26 - 50:32)
it's coming back uh trash cloak Burmy (50:28 - 50:37)
weasel East sea Shellos East West sea (50:32 - 50:38)
Shellos here I'll say both of them so no (50:37 - 50:41)
one gets mad drifloon glow (50:38 - 50:44)
finon uh and then you have your bubbling (50:41 - 50:45)
Meer which is Pikachu wearing a Lucas (50:44 - 50:48)
hat apom yanma gar shins no one ever (50:45 - 50:51)
needs another shins in their life crados (50:48 - 50:54)
shieldon sand cloak Burmy stunky which (50:51 - 50:56)
is the only Pokemon here here that (50:54 - 50:58)
couldn't be shiny until (50:56 - 51:03)
now Gibble hippopotas scupi and krunk (50:58 - 51:06)
and then in the hot mountain spring you (51:03 - 51:08)
got Pikachu you got (51:06 - 51:11)
lickatong ryhorn Magmar Eevee totic (51:08 - 51:14)
merro sneez Swinub snow rut Chimchar (51:11 - 51:17)
berer and snow the other thing I want to (51:14 - 51:18)
point out (51:17 - 51:21)
is I don't know you can blame Niantic if (51:18 - 51:24)
you want a lot of these Pokemon have had (51:21 - 51:27)
Community Days or have had some sort of (51:24 - 51:29)
event around them so you're you're (51:27 - 51:32)
taking two things you're taking (51:29 - 51:35)
the already very weak Pokedex that is (51:32 - 51:37)
CNO and you're taking a lot of these (51:35 - 51:40)
Pokemon have been featured before and (51:37 - 51:42)
you're trying to apply that experience (51:40 - 51:47)
to the last three hoen jotto Kanto and (51:42 - 51:49)
it's just (51:47 - 51:51)
like like sad (51:49 - 51:54)
face and the tour events have been (51:51 - 51:56)
getting weaker each time although I do (51:54 - 51:57)
think it sounded like the in-person ones (51:56 - 52:00)
are better than the worldwide (51:57 - 52:03)
ones um I had a great time at Vegas (52:00 - 52:06)
honestly I know there was (52:03 - 52:09)
the I to like look I know that like (52:06 - 52:11)
almost everyone complaining about Vegas (52:09 - 52:12)
weren't actually there and they just (52:11 - 52:14)
read like some Twitter post and they got (52:12 - 52:16)
angry because they wanted a reason to (52:14 - 52:20)
get angry at Niantic but like once they (52:16 - 52:22)
fixed the cell phone towers it was it (52:20 - 52:23)
was fine it was like actually a great (52:22 - 52:26)
event like finding the kle UNS spawn (52:23 - 52:27)
like the park like the habitat like it (52:26 - 52:29)
was good it was fine when you got past (52:27 - 52:32)
the dirt par that was the Park yeah once (52:29 - 52:34)
well actually the whole event fell apart (52:32 - 52:36)
once I wasn't allowed to climb on the (52:34 - 52:39)
giant dirt pile once they put Security (52:36 - 52:41)
on the top of that dirt pile that event (52:39 - 52:44)
fell apart no one was talking about that (52:41 - 52:47)
I had amazing cell phone service on the (52:44 - 52:50)
top of that giant Dirt (52:47 - 52:52)
Pile uh unknown is going to spawn it's (52:50 - 52:56)
going to spell CNO uh in the eggs uh (52:52 - 52:58)
it's the baby Pokemon 5K eggs will have (52:56 - 53:02)
stunky 10K eggs will have pisu catat (52:58 - 53:06)
carvine um Mesprit azelf and ukie are (53:02 - 53:08)
going to spawn in the wild like Latios (53:06 - 53:11)
Latias did uh there's going to be C (53:08 - 53:13)
snapshots they said there will (53:11 - 53:15)
be (53:13 - 53:18)
um (53:15 - 53:18)
10 special Spirit tomb Poké stops (53:19 - 53:25)
scattered across Los Angeles and or c (53:22 - 53:28)
Orange County 108 special Poké stops (53:25 - 53:30)
scattered across you spin 10 of them to (53:28 - 53:33)
get a spirit oh I read that wrong got it (53:30 - 53:37)
that's why we have Han on the show uh so (53:33 - 53:40)
that makes it seem like almost all of (53:37 - 53:43)
Los Angeles will have be play it seems (53:40 - 53:44)
like Spirit tomb is going to be the (53:43 - 53:46)
thing that makes this the most exciting (53:44 - 53:48)
for people who are looking for exciting (53:46 - 53:51)
things in game for this event the (53:48 - 53:53)
problem is I'm not sure any of the (53:51 - 53:55)
spirit Tom stuff is actually going to be (53:53 - 53:57)
in the Rose bow stadium and that's only (53:55 - 54:02)
going to be in the city experience mhm (53:57 - 54:02)
probably um no (54:02 - 54:10)
no no signs of archus no signs of manife (54:06 - 54:14)
no signs of fion uh they're just (54:10 - 54:16)
missing (54:14 - 54:19)
um we've got the rest of the season for (54:16 - 54:21)
that one would hope that (54:19 - 54:24)
maybe maybe if they do end up in go (54:21 - 54:27)
those would be avail (54:24 - 54:30)
worldwide I I think I I try to like I (54:27 - 54:32)
don't want to like I I do hate (54:30 - 54:34)
personally coming on the show and like (54:32 - 54:38)
dragging Pokemon related things um it's (54:34 - 54:40)
like not my intention but when you're (54:38 - 54:43)
spending so much money to go to La (54:40 - 54:44)
that's why we started the conversation (54:43 - 54:47)
with the cost of LA and then you look at (54:44 - 54:48)
this event compared to past events (54:47 - 54:51)
you're just like uh do I want to travel (54:48 - 54:54)
for this and it's a hard question to (54:51 - 54:57)
answer um obviously if you live in (54:54 - 54:59)
LA this this sounds awesome for you like (54:57 - 55:02)
this sounds like oh I just a simple day (54:59 - 55:05)
trip to the Rose bow uh and then I can (55:02 - 55:09)
explore my city and do that so I think (55:05 - 55:13)
of like how do you make this event (55:09 - 55:15)
better and I I just feel like why don't (55:13 - 55:17)
you just stick a bunch of huian Pokemon (55:15 - 55:22)
there it fits the theme yeah like the (55:17 - 55:23)
the thing that like I look at like (55:22 - 55:25)
Porygon and I look at Eevee and I look (55:23 - 55:27)
at well I'm actually excited for Pikachu (55:25 - 55:30)
wearing a hat but I I look at these (55:27 - 55:31)
older Pokemon and I just kind of like (55:30 - 55:33)
roll my eyes and it's like why isn't (55:31 - 55:36)
huian grow is spawning why isn't H huian (55:33 - 55:39)
sneez here why don't I get an encounter (55:36 - 55:42)
with like an over quill like they (55:39 - 55:45)
are Pokemon from CNO they're just an (55:42 - 55:47)
older CNO called the Hui region unless (55:45 - 55:49)
there was some like weird time zone (55:47 - 55:50)
thing I miss in Legends archus like you (55:49 - 55:54)
are catching those Pokemon in in like in (55:50 - 55:57)
and around Mount cornet yeah yeah they (55:54 - 55:58)
could do they could introduce a new (55:57 - 56:00)
feature specifically for this event I (55:58 - 56:03)
know they're not going to that is (56:00 - 56:04)
something like the opposite version of (56:03 - 56:06)
the SpaceTime distortions where all of (56:04 - 56:09)
the Hui Pokemon appear in certain (56:06 - 56:10)
sections of the event for a certain (56:09 - 56:13)
amount of time and that could be (56:10 - 56:16)
exciting I they should just add them in (56:13 - 56:18)
like they they have they have they have (56:16 - 56:22)
missed the bus of making the addition of (56:18 - 56:25)
Hui and Pokemon to a game being in event (56:22 - 56:28)
or important we've missed that bus they (56:25 - 56:30)
just sort of got plopped into scarlet (56:28 - 56:32)
and violet they could just plop them in (56:30 - 56:34)
here there have been events for most of (56:32 - 56:36)
them you can't say they got plopped in (56:34 - 56:37)
there have been events for most of them (56:36 - 56:39)
it's just happened over time they got (56:37 - 56:42)
plopped in there's no explanation as to (56:39 - 56:45)
why they just got popped in I I have (56:42 - 56:47)
been saying this since Legends archus (56:45 - 56:49)
has come out I will continue saying (56:47 - 56:52)
this and if somebody else has been (56:49 - 56:55)
saying it that's cool too I like but I (56:52 - 56:57)
haven't heard anyone else say it I think (56:55 - 57:00)
adding distortions to Pokemon go would (56:57 - 57:03)
actually be an exciting and cool feature (57:00 - 57:07)
if I'm sitting at my house and I open my (57:03 - 57:09)
game and I see at the park a distortion (57:07 - 57:12)
is forming in 20 minutes and there's (57:09 - 57:14)
supposed to be whatever Pokemon in there (57:12 - 57:17)
even in Legends archus I knew exactly (57:14 - 57:18)
what pokemon would spawn in the (57:17 - 57:21)
Distortion Like I knew the the Pokemon (57:18 - 57:23)
pool right like hopefully I get the (57:21 - 57:25)
three Porygon maybe I'll get the Magmar (57:23 - 57:28)
whatever I still sat there and waited (57:25 - 57:30)
for every single Distortion in that game (57:28 - 57:32)
because I was like I what what if it was (57:30 - 57:36)
the the ramp parted yeah like if I if if (57:32 - 57:39)
Niantic wanted to do something cool (57:36 - 57:40)
which they don't they don't want to do (57:39 - 57:42)
anything cool ever I don't (57:40 - 57:45)
know if they could take parks and their (57:42 - 57:47)
game recognizes what is a park and what (57:45 - 57:50)
is not a park and they could say like oh (57:47 - 57:51)
a distortion would form here and in this (57:50 - 57:53)
Distortion Like These are the only (57:51 - 57:54)
Pokemon and like who cares what they are (57:53 - 57:57)
like put porygons in there or whatever (57:54 - 57:59)
like you can change the distortions (57:57 - 58:02)
every month or however and everyone (57:59 - 58:03)
loves when the map changes if you go in (58:02 - 58:05)
there and the whole map changes and it (58:03 - 58:06)
looks like a different world like it (58:05 - 58:09)
does in Legends oh yeah get real excited (58:06 - 58:10)
like I think the thing that makes (58:09 - 58:13)
distortions also like appealing is like (58:10 - 58:16)
with a raid you can be like oh there's a (58:13 - 58:17)
festar Reggie gig spawning at the park (58:16 - 58:20)
down the street should I go no cuz no (58:17 - 58:21)
one's going to show up like I'm not (58:20 - 58:23)
going to go I can't do it myself like (58:21 - 58:25)
now you can kind of see the the people (58:23 - 58:26)
above your head but even at that point (58:25 - 58:28)
like that's useless to you you're like (58:26 - 58:29)
even if you're like 10 15 minutes (58:28 - 58:30)
walking from the park you're like I'm (58:29 - 58:32)
never going to make it even if I jump in (58:30 - 58:33)
my car I'm not going to make it in two (58:32 - 58:35)
minutes uh so you're going to miss it (58:33 - 58:39)
out but a distortion would attract (58:35 - 58:41)
people and then like you're because you (58:39 - 58:42)
don't need other people you just go (58:41 - 58:44)
there you're like okay cool cool the (58:42 - 58:45)
Porygon spawned this Distortion cool I (58:44 - 58:47)
caught it oh now there's a raid and oh (58:45 - 58:49)
there happen to be three other people (58:47 - 58:50)
here because they also came here because (58:49 - 58:51)
there's a destrution I don't know I (58:50 - 58:54)
think like again if I'm thinking of (58:51 - 58:57)
things that would make a c Tour event (58:54 - 58:59)
exciting great time to announce (58:57 - 59:01)
distortions in your game I don't know (58:59 - 59:03)
like no shade to Matteo but what are you (59:01 - 59:05)
doing what are you bringing me you're (59:03 - 59:06)
gonna bring my mom back to the game I (59:05 - 59:08)
don't think so Mato but you know maybe (59:06 - 59:10)
distortions we be like hey this is a (59:08 - 59:12)
really cool feature Coy free there's a (59:10 - 59:16)
park down your street I don't know I I (59:12 - 59:16)
just I I I I just want the c tour to go (59:17 - 59:22)
well and what they've announced so far (59:20 - 59:24)
seems (59:22 - 59:25)
very (59:24 - 59:27)
reserved (59:25 - 59:30)
yes yep yeah no I'm I'm still (59:27 - 59:32)
maintaining that the most exciting (59:30 - 59:34)
in-game part so far seems to be the (59:32 - 59:36)
spirit tomb since Spirit tomb can be (59:34 - 59:38)
shiny and everyone's been pretty annoyed (59:36 - 59:40)
at each Halloween when you can only get (59:38 - 59:43)
one since that one big Halloween one you (59:40 - 59:44)
could get (59:43 - 59:47)
many the Spinda stuff at Vegas was cool (59:44 - 59:49)
like legitimately very cool like there (59:47 - 59:54)
was I think seven spind stops and it was (59:49 - 59:56)
it was it was like like a cool social (59:54 - 59:58)
thing to see cuz you know we've been to (59:56 - 60:00)
like these Pokemon events and everyone's (59:58 - 60:01)
like looking down on their phone and (60:00 - 60:04)
like no one wants to like like I missed (60:01 - 60:08)
that whole party play event last week uh (60:04 - 60:10)
because I went to do community day I I (60:08 - 60:12)
did Community Day solo at the mall and I (60:10 - 60:13)
was like I'm going to ask somebody to (60:12 - 60:15)
join their party because then I'm GNA (60:13 - 60:18)
like I'm G to make friends then I'm (60:15 - 60:20)
going to be able to like finish this I (60:18 - 60:22)
didn't ask anyone I was too scared U the (60:20 - 60:24)
last time I asked people they were not (60:22 - 60:28)
actually playing Pokémon go (60:24 - 60:28)
but but in Vegas people were like oh I'm (60:28 - 60:34)
missing like Spinda 6 and like people (60:32 - 60:36)
would like look up from their phone and (60:34 - 60:38)
they'd be like ah Spinda 6 is like over (60:36 - 60:40)
by the the north side of the lake like (60:38 - 60:41)
people were actually talking and (60:40 - 60:42)
interacting with each other and like (60:41 - 60:45)
finding Spinda was like (60:42 - 60:48)
legitimately cool like Niantic you did (60:45 - 60:50)
the thing you envisioned you you made (60:48 - 60:53)
three people talk to each other like you (60:50 - 60:55)
did it the only time I saw that happened (60:53 - 60:58)
in New York was when there was a hyundo (60:55 - 60:59)
that's when all the all the chatter (60:58 - 61:01)
breaks out and everybody is yelling (60:59 - 61:03)
there's a hundo here and trying to get (61:01 - 61:05)
everybody to catch (61:03 - 61:08)
it oh that's pretty (61:05 - 61:10)
cool (61:08 - 61:14)
um tickets are $25 if you want to add on (61:10 - 61:15)
everything I already did the math it's (61:14 - 61:18)
like 115 bucks that's like the shirt (61:15 - 61:19)
that's the day before that's the day (61:18 - 61:22)
after that's the egg scam thing that you (61:19 - 61:24)
can add for 15 that's the raid pass (61:22 - 61:26)
lover which the The Raid pass lover is (61:24 - 61:29)
is normally worth it um for 15 the egg (61:26 - 61:31)
thing might be more worth it here than (61:29 - 61:33)
it was at go Fest because there is a (61:31 - 61:36)
hatch distance having like one half (61:33 - 61:39)
hatch distance for the whole event here (61:36 - 61:42)
yes I guess if you're very into catat (61:39 - 61:44)
carvine (61:42 - 61:46)
and whatever the other one (61:44 - 61:49)
is yes you should this could be their (61:46 - 61:53)
best way to get those is having the egg (61:49 - 61:55)
whatever again look I really really (61:53 - 61:58)
really like Pokemon go live events I (61:55 - 62:00)
went to Korea twice for them I've been (61:58 - 62:03)
to Japan for one I've been to Seattle (62:00 - 62:09)
and I've I've played Pokemon go a lot of (62:03 - 62:09)
places uh we're 75 days away from this (62:09 - 62:15)
event it's not looking like their best (62:13 - 62:18)
event that's all I'm (62:15 - 62:20)
saying I'm not saying it's going to be (62:18 - 62:23)
bad I'm just saying it's not looking (62:20 - 62:26)
like their best one and there will (62:23 - 62:30)
undoubtedly be a go Fest later next year (62:26 - 62:32)
yeah yeah yeah there there will for sure (62:30 - 62:34)
be like the three the the definitely the (62:32 - 62:37)
US the definitely Japan and where in (62:34 - 62:40)
Europe are they picking is is what it (62:37 - 62:41)
comes down (62:40 - 62:44)
too so yeah I'm I'm sure there'll be (62:41 - 62:46)
more I'm sure they'll be go fast so like (62:44 - 62:48)
look if you're on the fence and you can (62:46 - 62:49)
only go to like maybe your you only have (62:48 - 62:51)
the budget to travel to one event during (62:49 - 62:55)
the year skip this go wait wait for go (62:51 - 62:57)
Fest yeah like go Fest is always the (62:55 - 63:00)
better event if you are close to Los (62:57 - 63:02)
Angeles and this is easy I think this is (63:00 - 63:03)
a no-brainer to (63:02 - 63:05)
go (63:03 - 63:07)
um if you've been looking for a reason (63:05 - 63:12)
to go to La now you have a (63:07 - 63:12)
reason there's a reason you have a (63:12 - 63:20)
reason to go near La at least yeah um (63:14 - 63:22)
but they're doing a discount till the (63:20 - 63:27)
end of December so it's $25 instead of (63:22 - 63:30)
30 so I I'm thinking they don't expect (63:27 - 63:32)
to like just completely sell out because (63:30 - 63:34)
why would they discount it why would (63:32 - 63:36)
they early bird it uh I don't think ho (63:34 - 63:37)
and two are sold out (63:36 - 63:40)
until the end of January and I think the (63:37 - 63:42)
only day that actually sold out was (63:40 - 63:44)
Saturday um I think Sunday you could (63:42 - 63:46)
still buy tickets (63:44 - 63:49)
for uh and then if you want a shirt (63:46 - 63:51)
they're doing the you have to I believe (63:49 - 63:53)
it's the same as Vegas you have to like (63:51 - 63:57)
add the shirt to your ticket and then (63:53 - 63:59)
you just pick your shirt up there which (63:57 - 64:03)
I think was also at go Fest yep where (63:59 - 64:04)
you just pick the shirt up instead of (64:03 - 64:07)
which is fine it's it worked really well (64:04 - 64:10)
yeah super smooth you just show that um (64:07 - 64:12)
I guess there is like questions of like (64:10 - 64:14)
why it's in a stadium uh everywhere I (64:12 - 64:16)
read online is roseb actually has like (64:14 - 64:18)
terrible cell phone (64:16 - 64:21)
service um that it's a huge dead spot (64:18 - 64:24)
obviously Niantic sets up their own (64:21 - 64:26)
network and obviously they bring out (64:24 - 64:28)
cows the problem with Vegas to remind (64:26 - 64:30)
you was their network was supposed to (64:28 - 64:33)
handle slightly over the amount of (64:30 - 64:37)
people that bought tickets yet twice as (64:33 - 64:40)
many people showed up to then connect to (64:37 - 64:44)
the network to then do raids (64:40 - 64:46)
now I hate this argument because again (64:44 - 64:47)
so many people were not there they just (64:46 - 64:49)
take what they saw on Twitter or (64:47 - 64:50)
whatever and they're like yep it was a (64:49 - 64:52)
complete (64:50 - 64:55)
mess those people could could not (64:52 - 64:57)
actually play the game I want to remind (64:55 - 64:59)
you that they came to Vegas with the (64:57 - 65:01)
knowing that they couldn't play it and (64:59 - 65:04)
they're like well like they could see (65:01 - 65:08)
the raids but and like yes but like them (65:04 - 65:10)
being able to do the raids wasn't the (65:08 - 65:13)
problem they connected to the (65:10 - 65:16)
network that is the (65:13 - 65:19)
problem so I do wonder if like part of (65:16 - 65:22)
the stadium was like we can control (65:19 - 65:26)
who's coming in and out right like in (65:22 - 65:29)
Osaka you had to show your (65:26 - 65:31)
phone and you had to show that like you (65:29 - 65:32)
had the metal that you purchase like a (65:31 - 65:34)
Saturday or Sunday Ticket and then they (65:32 - 65:36)
let you in so they did nothing like that (65:34 - 65:40)
in New York yeah but that Park was (65:36 - 65:42)
completely open like the the the park in (65:40 - 65:46)
Osaka was a gated Park um so because the (65:42 - 65:48)
RO bow Rose Bowl is a building you (65:46 - 65:49)
technically have to enter I wonder if (65:48 - 65:52)
they're going to be checking to see if (65:49 - 65:53)
you actually bought a ticket to let you (65:52 - 65:55)
in (65:53 - 65:57)
um and then that being said they can (65:55 - 66:00)
control the network that they have set (65:57 - 66:03)
up in the stadium and therefore it (66:00 - 66:05)
shouldn't be a dead spot (66:03 - 66:08)
anymore keyword shouldn't (66:05 - 66:11)
be here's (66:08 - 66:14)
hoping um but yeah I guess I guess I (66:11 - 66:15)
guess we'll we'll find out when that (66:14 - 66:17)
happens final bit of go news I'm sorry I (66:15 - 66:19)
did say I did say this was a go heavy (66:17 - 66:21)
thing um there was a leak and we (66:19 - 66:23)
normally don't talk about leaks on the (66:21 - 66:25)
show papa pikachu also doesn't like when (66:23 - 66:28)
we talk about leaks at least for me um (66:25 - 66:32)
but when pokemon.com leaks their own (66:28 - 66:36)
event when pokemon.com updates with an (66:32 - 66:37)
article saying here are the next (66:36 - 66:39)
Community days and then promptly pulls (66:37 - 66:43)
that article uh 20 minutes later feel (66:39 - 66:44)
like the cat is out of the bag here at (66:43 - 66:49)
this point yeah they keep doing this too (66:44 - 66:51)
this is not the first time we're going (66:49 - 66:53)
to be reporting this off (66:51 - 66:55)
syap (66:53 - 66:57)
um so January (66:55 - 67:00)
6 uh which is a really weird date at (66:57 - 67:03)
this point but you know (67:00 - 67:07)
uh rowlet rowlet commun that makes sense (67:03 - 67:11)
you know rowlet is uh you know it's (67:07 - 67:14)
thegi has its own C Pokemon makes sense (67:11 - 67:17)
for Timeless whatever Hui Pokemon it (67:14 - 67:22)
does have a a huan counterpart yes and (67:17 - 67:25)
then following that January 20th Porygon (67:22 - 67:28)
day classic again does make sense with (67:25 - 67:32)
the huian theme they're going with cuz (67:28 - 67:35)
Porygon Z is from CNO for whatever (67:32 - 67:37)
that's (67:35 - 67:40)
worth uh and and I did see a lot of (67:37 - 67:43)
people be excited for Porygon um it's (67:40 - 67:45)
been a long time since Porygon commun (67:43 - 67:49)
day uh so having having that return it's (67:45 - 67:52)
a good shiny um Porygon does not spawn (67:49 - 67:57)
in the wild at all nor normally so it it (67:52 - 67:59)
feels like a a good classic Community to (67:57 - 68:02)
do and then on February 4th chansy which (67:59 - 68:06)
is the complete opposite of Porygon (68:02 - 68:08)
people are not excited about this but (68:06 - 68:10)
probably not for the reasons you (68:08 - 68:15)
think chansy is already a nightmare in (68:10 - 68:18)
gyms like when I see like a Blissey or a (68:15 - 68:20)
chy and then I see a slacking and then I (68:18 - 68:22)
see a Mel medal I'm like I'm out like (68:20 - 68:25)
you lost me here I do not so giving (68:22 - 68:28)
people pretty much unlimited chansy (68:25 - 68:31)
candy to then power up their blisses (68:28 - 68:34)
that will eventually be dropped in gyms (68:31 - 68:36)
yeah but the real trick is to drop a (68:34 - 68:38)
blissy and gym that has high HP but is (68:36 - 68:40)
nowhere near powered up as much as (68:38 - 68:42)
possible because when they're powered up (68:40 - 68:45)
as much as possible they lose their HP (68:42 - 68:47)
more even when people aren't battling (68:45 - 68:50)
them sorry minor go mechanic that's been (68:47 - 68:51)
there for a long time but you don't want (68:50 - 68:54)
to leave the most powered up possible (68:51 - 68:55)
chance fancy in a gym you want to leave (68:54 - 68:57)
the weaker one I promise but wouldn't (68:55 - 69:01)
you want to still leave a your most (68:57 - 69:03)
powered up one in a gym that is so high (69:01 - 69:06)
traffic that it constantly gets like (69:03 - 69:09)
Berry support yes if that's the case (69:06 - 69:11)
yeah yeah because like when I was when I (69:09 - 69:12)
was in Japan and I was at the Like (69:11 - 69:14)
official Pokemon (69:12 - 69:17)
go it wasn't really a store it was like (69:14 - 69:20)
a Meetup place next to the Pokemon (69:17 - 69:24)
Center like it was literally like Max CP (69:20 - 69:27)
chant Blissey Max CP slacking Max CP Mel (69:24 - 69:29)
metal Max CP like whatever the other (69:27 - 69:34)
three good ones are and they were no one (69:29 - 69:35)
could like I'm sure you could take it (69:34 - 69:37)
out but it was like a nightmare to get (69:35 - 69:39)
through cuz other people were there (69:37 - 69:41)
burying them and it was like I I I I (69:39 - 69:42)
don't have two hours to dedicate to take (69:41 - 69:45)
out this chy I just don't it's so timec (69:42 - 69:50)
consuming um chy is weird though um like (69:45 - 69:52)
I'm assuming aini will be in eggs (69:50 - 69:55)
obviously Blissey uh chansy has had (69:52 - 69:57)
events before where it's like like for (69:55 - 69:59)
Valentine's Day it's like been like (69:57 - 70:01)
slightly boosted or whatever yeah I (69:59 - 70:04)
wonder if the chansy thing is more so (70:01 - 70:07)
because ch's Japanese name is lucky so I (70:04 - 70:10)
wonder if this is going to Corr (70:07 - 70:12)
correspond with like a lucky event in (70:10 - 70:14)
Pokemon go (70:12 - 70:18)
or something related to I don't know I (70:14 - 70:19)
I'd have to look it I don't know if (70:18 - 70:20)
there's like a Chinese holiday or a (70:19 - 70:22)
Japanese holiday or something that's (70:20 - 70:24)
like a lucky week or something cuz that (70:22 - 70:25)
would only that would make the most (70:24 - 70:27)
sense of (70:25 - 70:30)
why they would pick chansy at this point (70:27 - 70:31)
in (70:30 - 70:34)
time maybe it does also kind of seem (70:31 - 70:36)
like they've just been going through the (70:34 - 70:40)
baby Pokemon yeah we had to last year (70:36 - 70:44)
throw a dart at aard what do we doing (70:40 - 70:47)
there's not always rhyme a (70:44 - 70:47)
reason um so yeah those are your next (70:47 - 70:53)
three Community Days they were on (70:50 - 70:55)
pokemon.com for for like a solid hour (70:53 - 70:58)
and then they were taking off (70:55 - 71:01)
pokemon.com but uh Rel is is exciting I (70:58 - 71:03)
think uh I think people are always (71:01 - 71:05)
always excited for starter Pokemon I'm (71:03 - 71:07)
excited for rowlet I love (71:05 - 71:09)
rowet what they really should do is give (71:07 - 71:12)
people the ability to evolve rowlet into (71:09 - 71:14)
either of its Evolution's final forms (71:12 - 71:17)
but they're not going to I am almost (71:14 - 71:19)
positive oh yeah you know in two years (71:17 - 71:22)
they'll figure out that (71:19 - 71:24)
mechanic his (71:22 - 71:28)
incoming to took him how long to figure (71:24 - 71:32)
out uh (71:28 - 71:32)
kleon all right this is off pokemon.com (71:32 - 71:36)
not a (71:34 - 71:40)
leak Pokemon Horizons the series will de (71:36 - 71:45)
on Netflix in February of (71:40 - 71:45)
2024 this is a (71:47 - 71:51)
[Applause] (71:50 - 71:54)
nightmare yep (71:51 - 71:59)
sure is this is a full year later and (71:54 - 72:02)
it's been in English in other countries (71:59 - 72:05)
yep do you guys know that Ash (72:02 - 72:08)
won (72:05 - 72:08)
what why (72:10 - 72:17)
why and it's not even I mean it's near (72:13 - 72:18)
the end of February right is it on (72:17 - 72:21)
Pokemon day or right before before (72:18 - 72:24)
Pokemon right yeah February 23rd (72:21 - 72:28)
27th yeah yeah Pokemon day is the 27th (72:24 - 72:31)
it premieres on the 23rd yep we've (72:28 - 72:34)
already had this running on the BBC in (72:31 - 72:37)
other countries in (72:34 - 72:37)
English is this (72:37 - 72:43)
like I I I don't think Netflix has this (72:39 - 72:45)
power but like why wouldn't Netflix want (72:43 - 72:48)
it as soon as possible Right like like (72:45 - 72:50)
would Netflix be like we'll give you (72:48 - 72:53)
more money if you hold out till February (72:50 - 72:56)
because we we we expect drop off and we (72:53 - 72:59)
want to like is that a thing would they (72:56 - 73:03)
do that yes they would so what this (72:59 - 73:06)
boils down to honestly what I think is (73:03 - 73:07)
Netflix (73:06 - 73:10)
determining the actual popularity of the (73:07 - 73:14)
thing and when they're what they so like (73:10 - 73:16)
because of the holiday season like they (73:14 - 73:18)
probably have it but we're not going to (73:16 - 73:20)
interrupt any of their holiday (73:18 - 73:22)
programming to put this (73:20 - 73:25)
out um why wouldn't they do it in (73:22 - 73:27)
January who knows what their big plans (73:25 - 73:28)
are for at the start of the year a bunch (73:27 - 73:30)
of stuff come in a bunch of stuff leave (73:28 - 73:33)
so this is it makes sense for (73:30 - 73:36)
a for something that they don't they (73:33 - 73:38)
know they have a niche audience for that (73:36 - 73:40)
they're just going to put it off into (73:38 - 73:42)
when they think it will fit into their (73:40 - 73:44)
schedule and since they know it's got a (73:42 - 73:46)
niche (73:44 - 73:48)
audience ultimately to them it doesn't (73:46 - 73:50)
really matter when they release it (73:48 - 73:51)
because they're going to get the (73:50 - 73:54)
audience they expect watching it (73:51 - 73:56)
whenever they decide to release it right (73:54 - 73:58)
like we would have watched it in (73:56 - 74:00)
December we would have watched it in (73:58 - 74:02)
November we will wait and watch it in (74:00 - 74:04)
February yeah we know the people who are (74:02 - 74:07)
going to watch this are in so they can (74:04 - 74:09)
slide it into their into their off week (74:07 - 74:12)
their dull month or whatever because (74:09 - 74:14)
they don't really care about the (74:12 - 74:16)
property it's not something that they (74:14 - 74:18)
are going on a bandw and tour and (74:16 - 74:21)
putting out coming to Netflix trailers (74:18 - 74:25)
about when is Pokemon coner coming out (74:21 - 74:28)
December that's probably part of it as (74:25 - 74:32)
well yep spacing those out and then also (74:28 - 74:34)
I do think that putting the release date (74:32 - 74:36)
of the new series close to Pokemon day (74:34 - 74:38)
when there is going to be some amount of (74:36 - 74:40)
Pokemon hype may also be a calculation (74:38 - 74:44)
there yeah yeah yeah I don't it but like (74:40 - 74:46)
the thing that I can't separate is like (74:44 - 74:51)
this anime has been out for a year now (74:46 - 74:55)
and it just feels like (74:51 - 74:55)
ah I we've I feel like we've talked (74:55 - 74:59)
about this to death but (74:57 - 75:02)
like when Ash (74:59 - 75:06)
won it didn't feel like this worldwide (75:02 - 75:08)
moment the Pokemon company made it out (75:06 - 75:11)
to feel it felt like a very Japanese (75:08 - 75:14)
moment which is like cool like I (75:11 - 75:18)
Japanese brand whatever but like in in (75:14 - 75:22)
almost 2024 we can definitely get (75:18 - 75:25)
everything coming out of the same (75:22 - 75:29)
time like like it (75:25 - 75:32)
also it all like it bringing me back to (75:29 - 75:34)
like the game it's also this is like a (75:32 - 75:36)
Nintendo thing but it's like so weird (75:34 - 75:39)
when like it's like worldwide release (75:36 - 75:42)
except it's not it's staggered like it (75:39 - 75:44)
is weird that like Japan gets it and (75:42 - 75:47)
Australia gets it and then like six (75:44 - 75:50)
hours later UK get and then it's like (75:47 - 75:52)
why is the eShop like this just release (75:50 - 75:54)
it at the same time for everyone why are (75:52 - 75:57)
people needing to like switch their (75:54 - 75:59)
their store to Australia to get the game (75:57 - 76:01)
like 12 hours early (75:59 - 76:05)
like I get time zones are hard but just (76:01 - 76:07)
hit the button just hit the button for (76:05 - 76:09)
everyone like PlayStation does this like (76:07 - 76:11)
when a new Destiny expansion comes out (76:09 - 76:14)
it'll be like it's coming out at 11 PM (76:11 - 76:17)
PST but figure out your for everyone (76:14 - 76:19)
like everyone's getting it at the same (76:17 - 76:22)
time a lot of places do that I don't (76:19 - 76:25)
know why they do that (76:22 - 76:25)
CRA this is like a whole year later like (76:27 - 76:33)
it's so frustrating to see (76:30 - 76:36)
like aren't you excited for Leo or like (76:33 - 76:38)
look at what Leo is doing in the anime (76:36 - 76:40)
it's like no I'm not excited because (76:38 - 76:44)
like I have no legal way to watch this (76:40 - 76:46)
like I can't even watch the subtitle one (76:44 - 76:48)
because it doesn't exist anywhere like (76:46 - 76:51)
if it if I could go on Crunchyroll and (76:48 - 76:52)
give it $5 a month or like read the (76:51 - 76:55)
subtitles oh yeah I would but I (76:52 - 76:58)
can't I I (76:55 - 77:01)
don't like it's so hard to care about a (76:58 - 77:04)
new anime when it's not actually new (77:01 - 77:07)
yeah I don't understand (77:04 - 77:10)
their I don't understand anything around (77:07 - 77:12)
how they handle the anime in America at (77:10 - 77:15)
all I don't I don't get like why is the (77:12 - 77:18)
BBC getting it now I I don't get the (77:15 - 77:21)
deal they made I don't get why they made (77:18 - 77:24)
the deal they did with Netflix I don't (77:21 - 77:28)
understand at all I mean I understand (77:24 - 77:29)
why they didn't go with Disney right (77:28 - 77:31)
like no I understand I understand it (77:29 - 77:34)
it's money I get that but but I also (77:31 - 77:37)
didn't understand like (77:34 - 77:41)
what terrible contract did you sign with (77:37 - 77:47)
Netflix cuz it's bad he did a bad (77:41 - 77:47)
contract that's why I said this is a (77:48 - 77:53)
nightmare I just want to watch people (77:51 - 77:57)
Pikachu that's all I (77:53 - 78:00)
want like I I think also my biggest (77:57 - 78:02)
fear is (78:00 - 78:06)
like watching the anime right like it (78:02 - 78:07)
coming out like watching like four (78:06 - 78:09)
episodes and like talking like you know (78:07 - 78:11)
the wa the old water cooler talk right (78:09 - 78:13)
you like you go into the office you lean (78:11 - 78:15)
against the water cooler you're like (78:13 - 78:17)
Hannah did you see when they finally (78:15 - 78:18)
introduce (78:17 - 78:21)
quackle and then this is my biggest we (78:18 - 78:24)
have is this show (78:21 - 78:25)
and then and then like somebody else at (78:24 - 78:27)
the water cooler being like Oh you know (78:25 - 78:30)
that waxley gets seriously injured and (78:27 - 78:32)
like they didn't show that it's like (78:30 - 78:33)
well you know I've been watching the (78:32 - 78:37)
anime for for for I watch the Japanese (78:33 - 78:40)
like yeah I mean this it seems like they (78:37 - 78:42)
may be trying to go with a more actual (78:40 - 78:45)
storyline slightly less (78:42 - 78:48)
episodic uh version of the anime here I (78:45 - 78:50)
don't know because I haven't watched any (78:48 - 78:52)
of it but from the trailers that's what (78:50 - 78:54)
it seemed like and that doesn't work (78:52 - 78:58)
well when everybody knows a year further (78:54 - 79:00)
of the story when you're just starting (78:58 - 79:04)
out I know like when I was in Japan even (79:00 - 79:07)
when I was in Korea in both both (79:04 - 79:09)
countries it's just on the Japanese it's (79:07 - 79:12)
just the the that's a spro on the TV (79:09 - 79:15)
right now be (79:12 - 79:19)
nice I could like it was like I want to (79:15 - 79:20)
watch it because it's cool but then it's (79:19 - 79:22)
like I don't I don't I don't speak the (79:20 - 79:24)
language number one I don't know what's (79:22 - 79:27)
happening number two even if I did speak (79:24 - 79:28)
it I don't know where in the story we (79:27 - 79:30)
are (79:28 - 79:34)
um yeah I I have no clue what it just (79:30 - 79:36)
like it's just so weird that you think (79:34 - 79:38)
of like okay we have the games we have (79:36 - 79:41)
the TCG we have the merchandise we have (79:38 - 79:43)
the anime but like it feels like the (79:41 - 79:45)
anime is just (79:43 - 79:50)
like it's off like it's a whole other (79:45 - 79:50)
Island like it would be very weird if (79:50 - 79:54)
they like held out on like you're not (79:52 - 79:57)
getting a claw sire plush for two years (79:54 - 79:59)
you get Claire in Japan you get in Korea (79:57 - 80:02)
you get in the UK but not you Americans (79:59 - 80:05)
no Claire plush for you they kind of do (80:02 - 80:09)
that though I will say I'm not sure they (80:05 - 80:11)
have a Claud sire plush in the US at (80:09 - 80:13)
this point okay well maybe not the best (80:11 - 80:15)
I'm the point is you can go to Pokemon (80:13 - 80:17)
Center and you can get pal and plushes (80:15 - 80:19)
they got a bunch maybe Claud sire not (80:17 - 80:21)
the best example there (80:19 - 80:25)
but there is a of palan merch you can (80:21 - 80:28)
find yes yes there (80:25 - 80:33)
is there are yeah your your segment time (80:28 - 80:35)
well we got a lot to talk about all (80:33 - 80:37)
right well let me let me let me run (80:35 - 80:38)
through (80:37 - 80:42)
it let's hold off on the producers thing (80:38 - 80:44)
let's set okay let's set up because (80:42 - 80:47)
that's a lot of that's next year first (80:44 - 80:48)
thing to talk about is the holiday (80:47 - 80:52)
schedule one mcar starts on the 7th of (80:48 - 80:54)
December (80:52 - 80:57)
December it is stated that if you do the (80:54 - 81:00)
pedal challenge you'll be able to get (80:57 - 81:04)
that license for free so you can either (81:00 - 81:06)
buy it straight away or go through the (81:04 - 81:08)
login daily like I we don't know the (81:06 - 81:11)
steps yet but apparently you can go in (81:08 - 81:12)
do all the various things go through the (81:11 - 81:14)
puzzle whatever they set up and get it (81:12 - 81:16)
for (81:14 - 81:18)
free uh they are bringing back the (81:16 - 81:21)
snowball battle in city which I said (81:18 - 81:22)
again the holiday event was going to be (81:21 - 81:24)
the same it's just the same snowball (81:22 - 81:26)
battle you get to throw snowballs at (81:24 - 81:29)
everybody it's fun uh they are bringing (81:26 - 81:32)
back Panic parade which is one of my (81:29 - 81:35)
favorite things they've done that comes (81:32 - 81:37)
been on the 20th of (81:35 - 81:39)
December and then one of the hinted at (81:37 - 81:42)
leaked Pokemon is decided to be real so (81:39 - 81:46)
the 26th of December Metagross will join (81:42 - 81:50)
the game so that is the next new uh (81:46 - 81:54)
Pokemon license added uh uh the new (81:50 - 81:56)
ranked season starts on the fifth so (81:54 - 81:59)
ranked season starts do we know if Mega (81:56 - 82:03)
Metagross is coming to go anytime (81:59 - 82:06)
soon uh not that I've (82:03 - 82:09)
heard uh yeah not not that we know for (82:06 - 82:11)
sure does did n antic say like there's a (82:09 - 82:14)
secret new Mega coming at the end of (82:11 - 82:16)
December that was not in any of the (82:14 - 82:19)
leaks I think okay or it was not in any (82:16 - 82:21)
of the uh leaked by the official website (82:19 - 82:23)
I'll say that (82:21 - 82:27)
pokemon.com didn't (82:23 - 82:30)
say uh okay go back to back to metag I (82:27 - 82:31)
was just like that just like something (82:30 - 82:33)
they could have lined up that's why I (82:31 - 82:35)
think of it like there's they're running (82:33 - 82:38)
out of Megas at this (82:35 - 82:44)
point uh the new battle pass uh features (82:38 - 82:48)
dark lord style Mewtwo which uh looks (82:44 - 82:50)
like meww wearing a Zoro skin it's a (82:48 - 82:53)
little dark uh (82:50 - 82:55)
so that is everything that we know (82:53 - 82:57)
that's happening (82:55 - 83:00)
in December probably the biggest thing (82:57 - 83:02)
is if you want to get meow Scara you can (83:00 - 83:05)
get it for free apparently um they have (83:02 - 83:07)
also announced that they are going to (83:05 - 83:09)
start doing Pokemon unite (83:07 - 83:11)
weekends (83:09 - 83:15)
so the first weekend the first Saturday (83:11 - 83:17)
Sunday of every month is now going to be (83:15 - 83:20)
a Pokemon unite weekend which they will (83:17 - 83:22)
give you free licenses to try out they (83:20 - 83:24)
are picking (83:22 - 83:26)
uh you can earn a special Platinum boost (83:24 - 83:30)
emblem and extra AOS coins and stuff so (83:26 - 83:31)
they have finally come out with Pokemon (83:30 - 83:35)
unite weekends officially dedicated to (83:31 - 83:38)
that so that isid playing on weekends (83:35 - 83:42)
got it yeah week are terrible to play so (83:38 - 83:45)
boy they're doing something so uh then (83:42 - 83:47)
we got the big draft letter the letter (83:45 - 83:51)
from the producers that is what they are (83:47 - 83:54)
going to bring to the game in 20 24 so (83:51 - 83:56)
all the stuff that we're talking about (83:54 - 84:01)
here do not go into (83:56 - 84:01)
place really soon couple things are (84:01 - 84:06)
going to we're going to notice the first (84:04 - 84:09)
big change on December 5th they will be (84:06 - 84:13)
adding what is called ex licenses yeah I (84:09 - 84:15)
have it right here yeah it'll it'll say (84:13 - 84:18)
ex license are a new classification uh (84:15 - 84:21)
for some existing and upcoming unite (84:18 - 84:23)
license this won't change the power (84:21 - 84:25)
level of specific Pokémon it will enable (84:23 - 84:27)
a special regulation in ranked matches (84:25 - 84:29)
where one or more Master ranked players (84:27 - 84:31)
uh are participating beginning on (84:29 - 84:34)
December 5th uh we will be adding ex (84:31 - 84:36)
classification to the additional Pokemon (84:34 - 84:41)
zachian Mewtwo X and meww Y and then in (84:36 - 84:44)
rank season 17 starting on January 16th (84:41 - 84:47)
the US of EX license including the three (84:44 - 84:50)
Pokemon uh uh listed above in each team (84:47 - 84:53)
will be prohibited regulation will (84:50 - 84:54)
change each series and the announcement (84:53 - 84:56)
before the start of the series you will (84:54 - 85:00)
be able to play as usual in other in (84:56 - 85:03)
battles other than ranked matches Yeah (85:00 - 85:06)
so basically the legendaries are going (85:03 - 85:10)
to be banned starting January 16th (85:06 - 85:12)
there's a little bit weirdness in the (85:10 - 85:15)
wording in the fact it allows us (85:12 - 85:18)
to the understanding people sort of have (85:15 - 85:21)
right now because they say special (85:18 - 85:23)
regulations and ranked matches where one (85:21 - 85:26)
or more Master ranked players are (85:23 - 85:29)
participating so it sounds like you will (85:26 - 85:33)
be able to use the ex licenses in (85:29 - 85:36)
matches if there are no master ranked (85:33 - 85:40)
players in that match but if there are (85:36 - 85:43)
Master ranked players these will be (85:40 - 85:44)
banned and (85:43 - 85:47)
unselectable that's so weird it is very (85:44 - 85:51)
weird we're not 100% sure if that's what (85:47 - 85:55)
they meant or if it's just going to be (85:51 - 85:58)
banned for ranked for (85:55 - 86:01)
season for the ne for season 17 starting (85:58 - 86:04)
on the 16th we'll find out when we get (86:01 - 86:07)
there but garbage King did post this and (86:04 - 86:10)
garbage King is on (86:07 - 86:13)
top I do want to also just as a side (86:10 - 86:15)
note there is a unite. pookemon (86:13 - 86:18)
website right and they do have a news (86:15 - 86:20)
section and the last time that news (86:18 - 86:22)
section was updated with a producer (86:20 - 86:26)
level letter was like July and this (86:22 - 86:28)
producer letter is on community. (86:26 - 86:32)
pokemon.com which like a forum (86:28 - 86:34)
like why was this hard to find why did I (86:32 - 86:36)
have to go to Twitter to click a link to (86:34 - 86:38)
get here why is this just not on yeah I (86:36 - 86:41)
I could not tell you it's maybe they had (86:38 - 86:43)
round of layoffs we didn't hear about (86:41 - 86:45)
also the one on the blame Niantic for (86:43 - 86:47)
this one the one of the (86:45 - 86:51)
Japanese servers Graphics beautifully (86:47 - 86:53)
Illustrated well done we just get weird (86:51 - 86:57)
text here yeah we just get like we just (86:53 - 86:59)
get like an Apple notes text drop it's (86:57 - 87:03)
bizarre I don't understand uh so how (86:59 - 87:05)
exactly these are going to be banned is (87:03 - 87:08)
still up in the air I (87:05 - 87:12)
would expect it I go in understanding (87:08 - 87:14)
starting the 16th you probably won't be (87:12 - 87:16)
able to select them as here's my (87:14 - 87:18)
question here's my question Greg yes why (87:16 - 87:22)
is Mew not an ex license as a mythical (87:18 - 87:24)
Legend (87:22 - 87:26)
like maybe there's more legendary (87:24 - 87:27)
Pokemon that I can't think of in unite (87:26 - 87:31)
obashi and Hoopa yeah Hoopa is also not (87:27 - 87:34)
in there um neither one of those two are (87:31 - 87:37)
problems they have balanced them into (87:34 - 87:39)
the ground um and they're not (87:37 - 87:43)
particularly great right now uh it is (87:39 - 87:46)
very possible that they are going to (87:43 - 87:48)
classify those two as ex license and (87:46 - 87:52)
crank their power back up um right now (87:48 - 87:55)
these to Mewtwo and zachian are still (87:52 - 87:58)
huge problems in the game um they're the (87:55 - 88:00)
source that everybody complains about uh (87:58 - 88:02)
so it makes sense that they're starting (88:00 - 88:04)
with them but there are other Legend (88:02 - 88:09)
like hoopa and Mew exists uh it could be (88:04 - 88:10)
that they are going to just decide to (88:09 - 88:12)
classify those as ex and once again (88:10 - 88:15)
crank them back up or GX they like they (88:12 - 88:17)
love those letters too they they love (88:15 - 88:19)
all the letter comination or what about (88:17 - 88:22)
V you love a good v card every have a (88:19 - 88:23)
good v card (88:22 - 88:26)
um cuz they said to some existing and (88:23 - 88:30)
upcoming Pokemon unite license (88:26 - 88:32)
so we don't know where they're going (88:30 - 88:33)
with this but we know the big problems (88:32 - 88:34)
they're taking care of to make people (88:33 - 88:37)
feel like they want to play the game (88:34 - 88:40)
also most likely this rank season will (88:37 - 88:42)
prohibit them and then the next one will (88:40 - 88:44)
be free freefor all (88:42 - 88:47)
again can you you like correct me if I'm (88:44 - 88:52)
wrong but could you have zachian and Mew (88:47 - 88:55)
on the same team oh yes you can so like (88:52 - 88:57)
like in my head the thing would be you (88:55 - 89:00)
could only have one ex on a team that is (88:57 - 89:02)
possible what they're doing with this uh (89:00 - 89:04)
which ties into the next (89:02 - 89:07)
paragraph uh draft picks are coming in (89:04 - 89:09)
rank message let's skip that one right (89:07 - 89:12)
now just do the boring one yeah uh (89:09 - 89:14)
moving forward we're uh adding and (89:12 - 89:17)
adjusting more items to help balance (89:14 - 89:19)
Pokemon in themselves on December 5th (89:17 - 89:21)
two new held items will be in the game (89:19 - 89:24)
shop the charging charm and the resonant (89:21 - 89:27)
guard so what what what are these two (89:24 - 89:30)
things doing don't know oh this is I (89:27 - 89:32)
thought you had the answers this is (89:30 - 89:34)
literally for most of us the first time (89:32 - 89:36)
we've heard about it they not on the (89:34 - 89:39)
test server we don't know people if it (89:36 - 89:43)
is they haven't nobody's covered it um (89:39 - 89:45)
nobody's said hey there's two new items (89:43 - 89:49)
coming for most people we're like okay (89:45 - 89:51)
what is this we have they have not said (89:49 - 89:54)
what these are yet oh um I would like (89:51 - 89:56)
Metagross it's been on the test server (89:54 - 89:58)
for a while (89:56 - 90:01)
mm that's weird uh isn't that what the (89:58 - 90:03)
test server is (90:01 - 90:07)
for uh yeah test these items we yeah we (90:03 - 90:08)
don't know what they are we don't know (90:07 - 90:11)
what they do (90:08 - 90:13)
um and it's coming in hand they're doing (90:11 - 90:16)
a lot of changes to items like forever (90:13 - 90:17)
leftovers was terrible and then (90:16 - 90:19)
leftovers just got a big boost so like (90:17 - 90:23)
leftovers is good again um (90:19 - 90:25)
what these are filling in (90:23 - 90:29)
for like item hole wise couldn't tell (90:25 - 90:32)
you what we were meeting it (90:29 - 90:35)
feels like charging ter might be like (90:32 - 90:39)
rapid scarf type where it builds up (90:35 - 90:40)
power and then once you hit it gives you (90:39 - 90:43)
power for a while resonant guard feels (90:40 - 90:45)
like a shield booster but we just don't (90:43 - 90:49)
have any clue um they just put him in (90:45 - 90:51)
here and everybody's (90:49 - 90:55)
like okay thanks Yuki we'll find out on (90:51 - 90:58)
the 5th what these are it's soon like (90:55 - 91:00)
they announced this they put this out on (90:58 - 91:04)
the 30th so we'll find out soon and see (91:00 - 91:06)
if they're worthwhile items aren't very (91:04 - 91:10)
exciting and ranked 18 starting on (91:06 - 91:13)
February 27th which is Pokemon day (91:10 - 91:16)
Pokemon day maybe new map new map new (91:13 - 91:19)
map we may get a new map with this as (91:16 - 91:21)
well uh draft picks will be introduced (91:19 - 91:24)
draft picks allow will allow both teams (91:21 - 91:28)
to vote on a Pokemon to ban after teams (91:24 - 91:30)
select a Pokemon to ban players will (91:28 - 91:32)
take turns choosing their Pokemon (91:30 - 91:34)
without choosing any Pokemon more than (91:32 - 91:37)
once regardless of which team has chosen (91:34 - 91:39)
it so that means somebody on the other (91:37 - 91:42)
team picks karant I cannot pick (91:39 - 91:44)
karant these draft picks will be the (91:42 - 91:46)
same that are used in tournaments (91:44 - 91:47)
leading up to the World Championships (91:46 - 91:49)
but we are considering ways to change (91:47 - 91:51)
the format to suit better for ranked (91:49 - 91:52)
play (91:51 - 91:54)
without necessarily adhering to the same (91:52 - 91:57)
rules also while targeting Master ranked (91:54 - 91:59)
players uh we are still considering the (91:57 - 92:02)
effect ranks and format of this (91:59 - 92:03)
temporary (92:02 - 92:07)
addition so that in itself there's a lot (92:03 - 92:11)
to unpack uh because not only is (92:07 - 92:16)
ranked different than tournament (92:11 - 92:18)
play (92:16 - 92:22)
but if you only played one Pokemon and (92:18 - 92:24)
it's banned you're kind of screwed if (92:22 - 92:25)
you only play one Pokemon and the team (92:24 - 92:28)
picks it you're kind of (92:25 - 92:33)
screwed yep so uh Greg good or bad (92:28 - 92:36)
change good uh overall this is a good (92:33 - 92:41)
change um there's a couple of things uh (92:36 - 92:44)
so draft pick (92:41 - 92:47)
battles at this point again they are (92:44 - 92:49)
saying that they're targeting Master (92:47 - 92:53)
ranked players so it again SK sounds (92:49 - 92:57)
like this won't kick in for you until (92:53 - 93:00)
you hit master rank and then the draft (92:57 - 93:04)
comes in because you're sort of at that (93:00 - 93:06)
point it's time for you to like Branch (93:04 - 93:07)
out from the thing that got you to (93:06 - 93:10)
Masters which is probably your ex (93:07 - 93:13)
license right like people ride Mewtwo to (93:10 - 93:15)
Masters and then start playing all the (93:13 - 93:16)
other things that they really want to (93:15 - 93:18)
play they're just they just go to (93:16 - 93:24)
Masters as fast as they can um (93:18 - 93:24)
as far as game balance is concerned it (93:24 - 93:32)
is it makes for way more (93:27 - 93:36)
interesting battles to see when people (93:32 - 93:38)
can't double up when you can't see the (93:36 - 93:41)
the go-tos that everybody chooses like (93:38 - 93:43)
when you see two erif fuss both on both (93:41 - 93:44)
sides you know exactly what they're (93:43 - 93:49)
going to do uh this gets more variety in (93:44 - 93:53)
those Master legendary yeah U is also (93:49 - 93:58)
legendary and it's not an ex um so it's (93:53 - 94:00)
overall it's a very good thing it also (93:58 - 94:03)
helps get people to understand their (94:00 - 94:05)
tournaments better so when you watch a (94:03 - 94:07)
tournament you're like what does the (94:05 - 94:08)
band mean and why are they going between (94:07 - 94:10)
the twos and how is this working like (94:08 - 94:12)
people will get to (94:10 - 94:15)
experience that for themselves and (94:12 - 94:17)
understand what that format looks like (94:15 - 94:19)
it'll be this is not unique a bunch of (94:17 - 94:22)
no this is not unique to a bunch of do (94:19 - 94:29)
this um it is good (94:22 - 94:29)
to for master ranked players who already (94:29 - 94:38)
do the thing where they play around with (94:33 - 94:40)
very once you hit master rank master (94:38 - 94:42)
rank ranches are a free-for-all and (94:40 - 94:46)
people rightfully say that up until (94:42 - 94:48)
master rank the game feels really (94:46 - 94:50)
competitive and everybody's trying and (94:48 - 94:52)
when you get to master rank it's just (94:50 - 94:54)
people messing around and being like (94:52 - 94:56)
well I got to play a sable Eye game (94:54 - 94:58)
because my rank doesn't matter anymore I (94:56 - 95:02)
can never fall out of Master so this (94:58 - 95:04)
sort of helps with that problem and sort (95:02 - 95:07)
of gives Master ranked players something (95:04 - 95:10)
more interesting to do then I'm GNA (95:07 - 95:14)
deliberately hobble my team by playing (95:10 - 95:17)
Sable ey and I'm just going to do jungle (95:14 - 95:20)
invade and just I don't care so this (95:17 - 95:24)
helps with that I think in the community (95:20 - 95:27)
overall everybody's very excited for (95:24 - 95:30)
draft pick to come two ranked matches um (95:27 - 95:32)
it'll be curious to see if they drop it (95:30 - 95:35)
down to like Ultra rank that starting an (95:32 - 95:37)
ultra rank they do draft like because (95:35 - 95:39)
they are really still very much (95:37 - 95:41)
considering who is going to be included (95:39 - 95:44)
in draft rank Mass uh (95:41 - 95:47)
matches probably at first I would (95:44 - 95:49)
imagine they just keep it at Master (95:47 - 95:51)
ranked players to see how popular it is (95:49 - 95:53)
when they get there (95:51 - 95:58)
but I think overall if you watch any (95:53 - 95:59)
unite (95:58 - 96:03)
content drafted matches are always more (95:59 - 96:06)
exciting because there's a wide variety (96:03 - 96:10)
of Pokemon on display and you can really (96:06 - 96:14)
see what each one does and how they can (96:10 - 96:16)
be effective in battle so I think (96:14 - 96:20)
overall this is a very positive Choice (96:16 - 96:22)
um again the devil is in how they (96:20 - 96:25)
implement it um and we'll see what that (96:22 - 96:28)
looks like but I (96:25 - 96:31)
think everybody is very excited for the (96:28 - 96:33)
I'm very excited to see this I want to (96:31 - 96:35)
play in that because I don't ever do (96:33 - 96:37)
tournaments um because tournament play (96:35 - 96:39)
is incredibly difficult like you need a (96:37 - 96:41)
dedicated five people and you have to do (96:39 - 96:43)
it on one it's usually a Saturday (96:41 - 96:45)
morning and then blah blah blah blah (96:43 - 96:46)
like there's a lot going into it so be (96:45 - 96:51)
able to get that feel in master rank um (96:46 - 96:54)
particularly with randoms that would be (96:51 - 96:58)
very interesting to see how that happens (96:54 - 97:00)
because you'll be able to also see if (96:58 - 97:02)
it's like tournament you'll be able to (97:00 - 97:04)
make your choices based off of what the (97:02 - 97:06)
other team also chose so if somebody (97:04 - 97:09)
chooses Blissey You' be like okay well (97:06 - 97:12)
we need we need a better healer we're (97:09 - 97:14)
going to go comay on this side to try to (97:12 - 97:17)
to compensate for Blissey or we know (97:14 - 97:19)
what Pokemon take down Blissey so make (97:17 - 97:21)
sure we that's going to be our attacker (97:19 - 97:23)
this time we've seen that and so there's (97:21 - 97:25)
a lot of interesting play as far as (97:23 - 97:26)
picking that comes (97:25 - 97:30)
into uh ranked and draft so I think it's (97:26 - 97:33)
a very exciting thing to come we do have (97:30 - 97:35)
to wait until Pokemon Day next year (97:33 - 97:37)
people are also saying we're getting a (97:35 - 97:39)
new map on that day they have not told (97:37 - 97:41)
us that here here's the more important (97:39 - 97:44)
question Greg yeah who are you Banning (97:41 - 97:47)
on the other team who's who's your like (97:44 - 97:49)
number one go-to like like if if I'm not (97:47 - 97:51)
sure who to ban this is the Pokemon I'm (97:49 - 97:52)
ban (97:51 - 97:55)
uh so if ex are banned obviously it's if (97:52 - 97:57)
it's going to be a ban if EXs are (97:55 - 97:59)
already banned the one that I will (97:57 - 98:02)
always ban at that point is (97:59 - 98:05)
k k is my number one ban pick not Goodra (98:02 - 98:08)
I thought people don't like Goodra (98:05 - 98:12)
Goodra has not been performing great (98:08 - 98:14)
anymore yeah you hate to hear it yeah (98:12 - 98:17)
hate to hear the underperformance uh (98:14 - 98:19)
Goodra uh in the face of the change that (98:17 - 98:23)
they made to the starters so Blastoise (98:19 - 98:26)
Venusaur and Charizard now arriving at (98:23 - 98:28)
level seven have radically altered this (98:26 - 98:31)
game uh and we are all still trying to (98:28 - 98:33)
compensate for what that new power level (98:31 - 98:36)
looks like because it is (98:33 - 98:39)
significant um so gter hasn't gter still (98:36 - 98:41)
good is just not as powerful as it once (98:39 - 98:45)
was um and (98:41 - 98:48)
Defenders you can still Target Defenders (98:45 - 98:52)
uh com on anything makes that thing (98:48 - 98:55)
broken immediately so if Co I will (98:52 - 98:59)
always b comay or Blissey those are the (98:55 - 99:01)
two that I will probably take out well (98:59 - 99:03)
Hannah told me before the show that if (99:01 - 99:07)
you play com she'll play Blazin with you (99:03 - 99:11)
that's what I was told get get good blaz (99:07 - 99:13)
actually good I heard there's a leather (99:11 - 99:15)
biker skin coming to (99:13 - 99:18)
BL there is I don't have the money for (99:15 - 99:20)
that and also I have not mentioned that (99:18 - 99:22)
I will play Unite at any point in time (99:20 - 99:25)
let me be that's that what I remember (99:22 - 99:27)
yeah you (99:25 - 99:30)
yeah you said you'd come back for blaz (99:27 - 99:32)
until you learned that it's a high skill (99:30 - 99:35)
level one uh I said I would consider it (99:32 - 99:38)
and now they have a a costume for it (99:35 - 99:40)
that I like but I don't have the money (99:38 - 99:42)
for it so valid so that's well Hannah (99:40 - 99:45)
now streams on Twitch uh she's she's (99:42 - 99:49)
taking biker gift Subs heck yeah for (99:45 - 99:52)
Blazin um also just so everybody is (99:49 - 99:54)
aware Metagross has been really bad on (99:52 - 99:58)
the test server like universally panned (99:54 - 100:01)
every's like it's bad uh are they going (99:58 - 100:02)
to pull a mammo swine where like they (100:01 - 100:04)
just know it'll sell (100:02 - 100:07)
regardless possibly they have a month to (100:04 - 100:10)
fix it um what's its uh what's its like (100:07 - 100:12)
unite move what's its what's its thing (100:10 - 100:16)
that it does okay so you know how (100:12 - 100:20)
crustal builds a wall yeah yeah yeah (100:16 - 100:22)
Metagross is Unite is it builds a crater (100:20 - 100:25)
and anybody who's in that crater is (100:22 - 100:28)
stuck oh and stuck with (100:25 - 100:32)
Metagross here's the problem with (100:28 - 100:35)
that most people that you want to be (100:32 - 100:38)
stuck with you all use a jack button and (100:35 - 100:40)
eject out immediately and then you as (100:38 - 100:43)
Metagross are stuck in your crater (100:40 - 100:45)
because you can't get (100:43 - 100:48)
out um (100:45 - 100:50)
and is it supposed to be like meteor (100:48 - 100:52)
Mash is that yeah supposed to be yeah (100:50 - 100:56)
and the other problem is a lot of the (100:52 - 100:59)
attackers have teleport to get out as (100:56 - 101:01)
well like there's a lot of ways for (100:59 - 101:06)
Pokemon to teleport out of the crater so (101:01 - 101:07)
so it would have been good at one point (101:06 - 101:11)
maybe but yeah with the existence of (101:07 - 101:14)
eject button if if that move becomes (101:11 - 101:15)
super powerful then a jack button (101:14 - 101:19)
becomes a uh an immediate for everybody (101:15 - 101:21)
because you don't want to be stuck in (101:19 - 101:24)
there and it can't follow you out so it (101:21 - 101:27)
is not a great implementation of its (101:24 - 101:29)
unite move right now we will see if they (101:27 - 101:32)
change it um but literally I've watched (101:29 - 101:35)
videos on the plus server and like (101:32 - 101:37)
meteor bash goes down the thing goes up (101:35 - 101:40)
and then you see five Pokemon eject out (101:37 - 101:42)
and this poor thing is like zipping (101:40 - 101:45)
around in the circle like okay cool I (101:42 - 101:48)
wasted my meteor unite because all these (101:45 - 101:52)
people popped out almost (101:48 - 101:56)
immediately um so yeah it's not its (101:52 - 101:58)
moves are okay they're not great it's (101:56 - 102:01)
got magnet rise Let it Fly and that's (101:58 - 102:04)
not been great and it's like uh it's a (102:01 - 102:07)
little underwhelming right now um we'll (102:04 - 102:11)
see what they do to make it better um (102:07 - 102:14)
and then there's still one more secret (102:11 - 102:16)
uh on the test servers that they haven't (102:14 - 102:17)
announced when we're getting it that's (102:16 - 102:18)
the one that everybody's waiting for and (102:17 - 102:20)
they knew it so they announced Metagross (102:18 - 102:23)
first because they know the next one is (102:20 - 102:26)
going to overshadow everything I mean (102:23 - 102:27)
Metagross is a very popular Pokemon it (102:26 - 102:29)
is very popular but not as popular as (102:27 - 102:33)
the other one that's on (102:29 - 102:33)
there uh well I think I think that's it (102:34 - 102:42)
it it it always sucks getting unite news (102:38 - 102:45)
not because it's bad but like because it (102:42 - 102:47)
makes me excited to play the game and (102:45 - 102:49)
then you're like ah but you know DLC is (102:47 - 102:51)
in like 10 days I don't want to like (102:49 - 102:56)
get into unite and then stop because oh (102:51 - 102:57)
another another quick thing Janine has (102:56 - 102:59)
been added to the smooching booth and (102:57 - 103:02)
Masters so you can now thank goodness (102:59 - 103:05)

get the biker skin get the biker (104:09 - 104:15)
skin there you go uh okay well we'll be (104:12 - 104:17)
back next week uh I believe next week's (104:15 - 104:20)
episode will be the last week (104:17 - 104:24)
before the DLC um I'm expecting that (104:20 - 104:26)
there'll be at least one more trailer (104:24 - 104:29)
whether that trailer will have new stuff (104:26 - 104:31)
in it it doesn't matter but I'm (104:29 - 104:32)
expecting there'll be one more trailer (104:31 - 104:35)
for the Indigo disc (104:32 - 104:37)
because why would they they should (104:35 - 104:40)
probably advertise their upcoming DLC (104:37 - 104:41)
maybe a little bit I don't know they (104:40 - 104:44)
should probably remind people that it's (104:41 - 104:49)
it's coming out relatively soon so um I (104:44 - 104:51)
expect that to happen uh but again I (104:49 - 104:54)
don't the only thing I could expect that (104:51 - 104:59)
they would show in a trailer would be (104:54 - 105:02)
some way to get like legendary Pokemon (104:59 - 105:04)
um because we do expect legendary (105:02 - 105:05)
Pokemon to come back and I do remember (105:04 - 105:08)
for Crown Tundra they were like here's (105:05 - 105:11)
Dynamax adventure and (105:08 - 105:14)
like they haven't talked about that at (105:11 - 105:18)
all yeah so I had a lot of people ask me (105:14 - 105:19)
like so what's the legendary thing for (105:18 - 105:22)
this one I'm like good question what is (105:19 - 105:26)
it because we don't know no one (105:22 - 105:29)
knows so maybe maybe they'll save it for (105:26 - 105:32)
the third uh Callos DLC maybe that's it (105:29 - 105:35)
you go back to Callos and all the leg (105:32 - 105:37)
are just there they're all just in lumo (105:35 - 105:39)
